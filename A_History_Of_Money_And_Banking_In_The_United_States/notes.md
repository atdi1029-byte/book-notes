# Detailed Notes — A History of Money and Banking in the United States

## Introduction (by Joseph T. Salerno)

### Rothbard's Method vs. "New Economic History"

Salerno contrasts Rothbard's Austrian approach with the dominant "cliometric" or "new economic history" method:

- **Cliometrics** (Douglass North, Friedman & Schwartz): Treats history as a laboratory for testing economic theory. Focuses on quantitative data, statistical methods, and measurable variables. The "money supply" is the protagonist; human motives are sidelined.
- **Rothbard's approach**: Uses praxeology (the logic of human action) as the foundation. Economic laws are known *a priori* through deduction, not derived from historical data. History is the realm of unique, complex events driven by individual purposes and ideas.
- Rothbard insists on treating each historical episode as a unique event shaped by specific human actors with identifiable goals — not as an instance of a repeatable "class" of events amenable to statistical generalization.

### Mises's Method of Historical Research

Rothbard builds on Ludwig von Mises's framework from *Theory and History*:

- **Ideas are the primordial stuff of history.** "Human action is the conscious effort of man to substitute more satisfactory conditions for less satisfactory ones."
- **"Specific understanding"** is the historian's essential tool — the same empathetic technique everyone uses in daily life to grasp others' motives, but applied rigorously to historical actors.
- **Thymology**: Mises's term for the accumulated body of knowledge about human values, desires, and character derived from everyday experience and introspection. It yields "historical facts" (unique, non-repeatable) vs. "scientific facts" (timeless, repeatable).
- **The "weighting problem"**: Even after identifying all relevant causal factors, the historian must assign relative weights to each — a task that requires judgment, not statistical measurement.

### Rothbard's Theoretical Guide: "Cui Bono?"

Rothbard's distinctive contribution is a "theoretical guide" for the economic historian:

- **The State as an oligarchic ruling class**: Throughout history, the State has been an organization of a minority that parasitically extracts wealth from the productive majority through taxation and monopoly privileges.
- **The "Iron Law of Oligarchy"**: All States, regardless of formal organization, are effectively run by a small ruling elite (a manifestation of the law of comparative advantage applied to political power).
- **"Court Intellectuals"**: The ruling class requires ideological cover from intellectuals (formerly clergy, now academics) who fabricate justifications for State power in exchange for wealth and prestige.
- **The guide**: When investigating political actions, *first look for the hidden economic motive*. Those who use "political means" to acquire income are motivated primarily by economic self-interest, even when they trumpet ideological or altruistic goals. The ideology is "the smoke screen for their loot."

> "The task of the historian, then, is to penetrate to the essence of the transaction, to strip the ideological garb from the Emperor State and to reveal the economic motive at the heart of the issue."

### Rothbard vs. Friedman & Schwartz

Salerno contrasts Rothbard's treatment of the Federal Reserve's origins with Friedman & Schwartz's *A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960*:

- **Friedman & Schwartz**: Positivist approach. The "unmotivated money supply" is the star. They portray the Fed's creation as a "straightforward, disinterested, bipartisan effort" to solve the technical problem of currency "inelasticity." Their 100 pages on 1879–1914 devote only 11 pages to the political and social factors behind the Fed's creation. They dismiss the money controversies of the 1870s–1890s as driven by "zaniness and crankiness."
- **Rothbard**: Traces the Fed's creation to a deliberate campaign by Wall Street banking interests (Morgan, Rockefeller axis) beginning in the 1890s — a full decade before the 1907 panic. These elites sought a central bank to provide "elastic" paper reserves that would enable greater credit inflation and cartelize the banking industry under their control. The "public interest" rhetoric was ideological cover.

### Overview of the Five Parts

1. **Part 1**: Colonial beginnings to 1900 — commodity money, the First and Second Banks, Jeffersonian/Jacksonian opposition, the free banking era (1830s–Civil War), the National Banking System and its destabilizing effects
2. **Part 2**: Origins of the Federal Reserve — the Morgan/Rockefeller banking cartel's campaign from the 1890s through 1913
3. **Part 3**: Hoover to Roosevelt — Fed policy 1914–1928, Morgan vs. Rockefeller conflicts, Fed behavior during the Depression
4. **Part 4**: The gold-exchange standard in the interwar years — Britain and America's flawed reconstruction of international monetary order in the 1920s and its collapse
5. **Part 5**: The New Deal and international monetary system — shift from "dollar nationalism" to "dollar imperialism," culminating in Bretton Woods (1944)

## Part 1: A History of Money and Banking Before the Twentieth Century

### Colonial Money and Bimetallism

- Colonial America used British pounds, pence, and shillings. Britain was officially on a **silver standard** (shilling = 86 Troy grains of silver), but also coined gold guineas (129.4 grains), creating a de facto **bimetallic standard**.
- Bimetallism inevitably triggered **Gresham's Law**: government-fixed mint ratios overvalued gold relative to silver's world market price, so full-bodied silver coins disappeared from circulation (exported or hoarded) while only lightweight/eroded silver coins and gold remained.

> "Bad money drives out good." But the important point to note is that the triumph of "bad" money is the result, *not* of perverse free-market competition, but of government using the compulsory legal tender power to privilege one money above another.

- In the sparsely settled colonies, **commodity money** emerged naturally: beaver fur, wampum, fish, corn (in the North); rice (South Carolina); **tobacco** in Virginia — with warehouse receipts circulating as currency backed 100% by tobacco stored in warehouses.
- As colonial trade grew, Americans imported gold and silver coins from Europe and the West Indies. **Foreign coins constituted much of U.S. coinage** until Congress outlawed them in 1857. There was no inherent need for a national government coinage monopoly.

### Shilling and Dollar Manipulations

- The **Spanish silver dollar** (387 grains of pure silver, "pieces of eight") was the leading specie coin in America, entering via West Indies trade. It was the most stable and least debased coin in the Western world from the 16th to 19th centuries.
- The natural free-market ratio between the Spanish dollar and the English shilling was **4 shillings 6 pence per dollar**.
- Complaints about a "scarcity of money" in the colonies were largely manufactured. England's mercantilist hoarding of specie and prohibition of colonial minting did not prevent Americans from importing Spanish and other foreign coins.
- Colonial governments engaged in **competitive debasement of shillings** — Massachusetts (1642) arbitrarily valued the dollar at 5 shillings instead of 4s 6d to attract silver dollars and subsidize exports. Connecticut and others followed, escalating the debasement race. The English government halted this in 1707.

### Government Paper Money

- **Massachusetts invented government fiat paper money in 1690** — the first in the Western world. To pay soldiers after a failed expedition against Quebec, Massachusetts printed £7,000 in paper notes with a pledge to redeem them in gold/silver and issue no more.
- Both pledges were immediately broken. By February 1691 the government declared the issue "far short" and printed £40,000 more. Within a year the paper pound had **depreciated 40% against specie**.
- By 1692, Massachusetts made paper **compulsory legal tender at par** with specie, triggering Gresham's Law — specie disappeared from circulation while inflated paper flooded in. The "shortage" of specie was *caused* by the paper issues, not cured by them.
- Massachusetts formed a government **"land bank"** in 1716, issuing £100,000 in notes loaned on real estate — doubling prices over 20 years and driving out Spanish silver.
- A failed 1744 French expedition led to massive new emissions (£300,000 to £2.5 million in circulation by 1748). Silver rose to **60 shillings per ounce** — ten times the 1690 price.
- By 1740, every colony except Virginia had issued fiat paper. **Rhode Island** was the most inflationary; it exploited its ability to export inflation to Massachusetts by spending inflated notes there before prices adjusted.
- **Maryland's 1733 "helicopter money"**: the public land bank issued £70,000, of which £30,000 was *given away* in fixed amounts to each inhabitant — "probably the closest approximation in history of Milton Friedman's 'helicopter' model."

**Parliament intervenes**: After King George's War (1748), Parliament pressured colonies to retire paper and return to specie. In 1751, Britain prohibited legal tender paper in New England; in 1764, extended the prohibition to all colonies. The resumption of specie brought **more prosperous trade and stable prices**, not the predicted recession.

> The return to specie occasioned remarkably little dislocation, recession, or price deflation... "the restored specie system operated after 1750 with remarkable stability during the Seven Years War and during the dislocation of international payments in the last years before the Revolution."

### Private Bank Notes

- **Private bank notes** (redeemable in specie) had begun in Venice in the 14th century. In England, banking started with "scriveners" in the 17th century, then moved to goldsmiths after Charles I confiscated £200,000 in gold from the royal mint in 1638.
- Goldsmiths issued warehouse receipts for deposited gold. By the 1660s, they fell prey to issuing **pseudo-warehouse receipts** not backed by gold — the birth of **fractional reserve banking** in England.
- Very few private banks existed in colonial America. The most notable was the **Massachusetts Land Bank of 1740** (issuing irredeemable notes on real estate), which depreciated rapidly. Parliament outlawed it and the competing silver bank in 1741.
- Inflationary colonial schemes were **advocated by wealthy merchants and land speculators** (who were heavy debtors), not just poor agrarians — the "debtor class" and "creditor class" were not rigid categories.

### Revolutionary War Finance

- The Continental Congress began issuing fiat **"Continentals"** in June 1775, led by **Gouverneur Morris**. No pledge of redemption was made. Pre-war money supply: ~$12 million.
- Congress issued $6 million in 1775, then escalated: $19M (1776), $13M (1777), $64M (1778), $125M (1779) — **over $225 million** in five years on top of a $12M base.
- Depreciation was catastrophic: $1 Continental = $1.25 specie (end of 1776) → 3-to-1 (1777) → 6.8-to-1 (Dec 1778) → 42-to-1 (1779) → **168-to-1** by spring 1781 — giving rise to "not worth a Continental."
- States issued another **$210 million** in depreciated dollars. Price controls and compulsory par laws failed — farmers refused Continentals, the Army resorted to **"impressment"** (seizure) of food and supplies.
- By 1779, Congress switched to **loan certificates** ($600 million by war's end) — nominally public debt but effectively paper currency that also depreciated rapidly. The bulk became the core of **permanent peacetime federal debt**.

### Robert Morris and the Nationalist Program

- **Robert Morris**, wealthy Philadelphia merchant and financial czar of the Continental Congress, reversed the natural depreciation of wartime paper. He campaigned to make the depreciated federal debt redeemable at par and for federal assumption of state debts.
- His motives: (a) deliver a **windfall to speculators** who had purchased public debt at deep discounts, and (b) build pressure for federal **taxing power** (which the Articles of Confederation denied).
- Morris's nationalist program — strong central government, federal taxing power, permanent public debt — was carried forward by his protégé **Alexander Hamilton** and triumphed with the Constitution.

### The Bank of North America

- In 1781, Morris created the **Bank of North America** — the first commercial bank and first central bank in U.S. history. Modeled on the Bank of England: a privately owned fractional reserve bank with a government-granted monopoly.
- The bank received the privilege of its notes being receivable for all government duties and taxes at par with specie, and no other banks were permitted to operate. In return, the bank would lend its newly created money to the government to purchase public debt.
- Morris **failed to raise the required specie capital** and simply appropriated French specie loans to the U.S. to capitalize his own bank — "an act tantamount to embezzlement."
- Despite monopoly privileges, the market perceived the bank's notes as inflated. Confidence eroded, notes depreciated outside Philadelphia, and the bank hired people to demand specie redemption constantly to shore up appearances.
- Morris's political power waned after the war; by 1783, the bank was converted to a private Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank. **The first U.S. central bank experiment had ended.**
- Post-war, seven states tried to reinflate with paper money — all failed. North Carolina's paper lost 50%+ of value, coin vanished, and merchants suffered severe losses from compulsory par laws. The expansion of private banking after 1782 (Bank of New York, Massachusetts Bank) did not help — state paper issues continued to depreciate.

### The United States: Bimetallic Coinage

- The Constitution (Art. I, §8) gave Congress power to coin money; Art. I, §10 prohibited states from coining money, emitting paper, or making anything but gold and silver legal tender — a clear rebuff to the colonial/Revolutionary paper money experience.
- The **Coinage Act of 1792** established a bimetallic dollar: **371.25 grains of pure silver** *and/or* **24.75 grains of pure gold** — a fixed ratio of **15-to-1**. Both silver and gold coins were legal tender. The basic silver coin was the dollar; the basic gold coin the $10 eagle (247.5 grains of gold).
- The 15-to-1 ratio matched the market ratio in the early 1790s, but was doomed: as silver production from Mexican mines surged, the market ratio fell to 15.5-to-1 by the 1790s and ~15.75-to-1 after 1805. Gold was now undervalued at the mint.
- **Gresham's Law in action**: by 1810, gold coins had disappeared from circulation and only silver (domestic and foreign) circulated. From 1810 to 1834, only silver coin was in use.
- Foreign coins (80% of domestic specie in 1800) were mostly Spanish silver. Spanish dollars were heavier than American equivalents, so American silver dollars were re-exported. The U.S. was left with only lightweight Spanish fractional silver coins — an ironic tangle of Gresham's Law effects.

### The First Bank of the United States: 1791–1811

- Hamilton's **"Report on a National Bank"** (December 1790) proposed a central bank owned privately with the government holding one-fifth of shares. Its notes would be redeemable in specie and receivable for all government taxes — quasi-legal tender status. It would be the government's depository and lend to the government.
- Congress chartered the **First Bank of the United States** in February 1791 for 20 years. Thomas Willing (Robert Morris's former partner and Bank of North America president) was made its president.
- The bank immediately inflated: millions in paper money and demand deposits pyramided on $2 million in specie. It invested heavily in government debt and lent massively to the government ($6.2 million by 1796).
- **Wholesale prices rose 72%** from 1791 to 1796 (index 85 → 146). Speculation boomed in government securities and real estate. The bank's expansion spurred 18 new state banks in five years.
- The bank triggered a **constitutional debate**: Jeffersonians argued Congress had no power to charter a bank. Hamilton countered with the **"implied powers"** doctrine — the Constitution granted powers for "carrying out vague national goals." This interpretation won officially in **McCulloch v. Maryland** (1819) via Chief Justice John Marshall (a Hamilton disciple).
- When recharter came in 1811, it was **defeated by one vote** in both House and Senate. The Old Republican hard-money faction of the Democratic-Republicans voted it down. Importantly, the major forces *in favor* of recharter were merchants, chambers of commerce, and the state banks themselves — who valued the cheap credit and feared credit contraction if the Bank liquidated. This contradicts the myth that central banks restrain state bank inflation.
- By 1811: 117 state banks with $2.57 million specie supporting $10.95 million in notes and deposits — a **pyramid ratio of 4.26-to-1** (reserve ratio 0.23). The Bank of the United States itself had $5.01 million in specie against $12.87 million in liabilities — pyramid ratio of **2.57-to-1**.

### The War of 1812 and Its Aftermath

- The War of 1812–15 had **momentous monetary consequences**. New England banks remained conservative (opposed the war), but the government encouraged reckless inflationary banks in the Mid-Atlantic, Southern, and Western states to print notes and buy government bonds.
- Banks increased from 117 (1811) to 212 (1815), plus 35 private unincorporated banks. Total notes and deposits surged from $10.95 million to $31.6 million — an **87% increase** — while specie barely doubled. The national pyramid ratio rose from 3.70-to-1 to **5.85-to-1** (reserve ratio fell from 0.27 to 0.17).
- **Regional disparities were extreme**: Massachusetts pyramid ratio was 1.96-to-1 vs. Pennsylvania at 19.2-to-1, South Carolina at 18.46-to-1, and Virginia at 18.73-to-1.
- New England banks called on the inflating banks to redeem in specie, threatening insolvency. In August 1814, a **fateful decision**: the federal and state governments permitted banks outside New England to **suspend specie payments** — stopping all redemption of notes in gold/silver while continuing operations. This lasted **two and a half years** (until February 1817).

> In short, in one of the most flagrant violations of property rights in American history, the banks were permitted to waive their contractual obligations to pay in specie while they themselves could expand their loans and operations and force their own debtors to repay their loans as usual.

- This set a **devastating precedent**: every future banking crisis (1819, 1837, 1839, 1857) would see governments permit general suspension of specie payments, teaching banks they would never be required to honor their contracts. Inflationary expansion was permanently encouraged.
- **Treasury notes** issued to finance the war also fueled inflation — they functioned as quasi-legal tender money and were used by banks as "high-powered" reserves for further pyramiding.
- Wholesale prices rose 35% (1811–1815); imported commodities rose 70%. The wreckage of this episode was not just the inflation itself but the precedent of suspension.

### "Free Banking" — Decentralization Without Freedom

- The pre-Civil War banking system, even without a central bank, was **not truly "free banking."** Genuine free banking means banks are treated like any other business — they must redeem their obligations promptly or face immediate insolvency and liquidation.
- The tradition of periodic general suspensions (starting 1814) meant banks knew they could inflate without consequence. The system was **"Decentralization without Freedom"** — decentralized in structure but not subject to market discipline.
- **Money brokers** emerged to police the system: they bought depreciated bank notes at a discount, traveled to the issuing bank's home office, and demanded specie redemption. Monthly journals called "bank note detectors" evaluated the market rates of various bank notes.
- **"Wildcat" banks** located in remote areas to make redemption difficult — but they could only exist because periodic suspension removed the market's ultimate discipline.
- States actively **protected banks from money brokers**: Maryland and Pennsylvania passed laws during the 1819 panic requiring banks to pay specie or forfeit charters — then immediately exempted banks from paying brokers. Maryland passed a compulsory par law prohibiting exchange of specie for bank notes at less than par. North Carolina banks agreed not to pay specie to brokers at all; states imposed heavy licensing fees on money brokers.
- **Condy Raguet** (Philadelphia state senator) explained the situation to David Ricardo: "The whole of our population are either stockholders of banks or in debt to them. It is not the *interest* of the first to press the banks and the rest are *afraid*. This is the whole secret."

### The Second Bank of the United States: 1816–1833

- After the War of 1812, two paths existed: (a) the **hard-money path** — compel banks to redeem in specie or liquidate, restoring sound money; or (b) the **Federalist path** — establish a new central bank. The Democratic-Republican establishment chose (b).
- The **Second Bank** (chartered 1816) was modeled on the First: privately owned, one-fifth government shares, notes redeemable in specie and receivable for taxes, government depository. Purpose: create a national paper currency and purchase government debt.
- Instead of compelling suspended banks to resume, the Second Bank **cut a deal**: it issued $6 million in credit to state banks in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Virginia *before* insisting on specie resumption. In return, the state banks "graciously" resumed specie payments, and the two sides agreed to mutually support each other in any future emergency — meaning the stronger Second Bank would prop up weaker state banks.
- The Second Bank was pushed through by Secretary of the Treasury **Alexander J. Dallas**, a close associate of Philadelphia banker **Stephen Girard** (one of the two wealthiest men in America). Girard was the largest stockholder of the old First Bank, a heavy investor in war debt, and purchased $3 million of the Second Bank's $28 million stock. His close friend **John Jacob Astor** also invested heavily. Dallas's appointment as Treasury Secretary was engineered by these men.
- **William Jones**, a close friend of Girard and Dallas, was made president of the Second Bank. Senator William H. Wells (Federalist, Delaware) prophetically warned the bank was "simply a paper-making machine."

#### The Second Bank's Inflation and the Panic of 1819

- The resumption of specie payments after 1817 was **nominal, not real** — there was still a premium on specie and a discount on bank notes. The Second Bank lacked the courage to insist on specie payment from state banks; state banks had $2.4 million in unpaid balances at the Bank, held as virtual interest-free loans.
- From its inception, the Second Bank launched a **spectacular inflation**. It failed to raise its legally required $7 million in specie capital; specie never exceeded $2.5 million. By July 1818, the Bank had $2.36 million in specie against $21.8 million in notes and deposits — a **pyramid ratio of 9.24-to-1** (reserve ratio 0.11). In 18 months it had added $19.2 million to the nation's money supply.
- **Outright fraud** was rampant, especially at the Philadelphia and Baltimore branches (three-fifths of all loans). The bank's attempt at "uniform national currency" failed because western/southern branches inflated recklessly while conservative New York and Boston branches were stripped of specie to redeem inflated notes at par.
- The Second Bank's expansion **spurred further state bank inflation**: incorporated banks grew from 232 (1816) to 338 (1818). Kentucky alone chartered 40 new banks in one legislative session. The estimated total money supply rose from **$67.3 million (1816) to $94.7 million (1818)** — a 40.7% increase in two years.
- A full-scale **inflationary boom** erupted: export staple prices soared (Charleston index 102→160), real estate and slave prices surged, turnpike construction boomed, and the **New York Stock Exchange** opened in March 1817. Investment banking began.
- Starting in July 1818, the government and Second Bank saw they were heading toward insolvency. The bank launched **heroic contractions**: forced curtailment of loans, enforced specie redemption from state banks, purchased millions in specie from abroad. Bank president Jones was ousted.
- **The Bank of the United States contracted its notes and deposits by 47.2%** in one year (June 1818: $21.9M → June 1819: $11.5M). State banks fell from $72M to $62.7M. Adding Treasury note contraction ($8.81M→0), total money supply fell from **$103.5M (1818) to $74.2M (1819) — a 28.3% contraction in one year.**
- The result: America's **first nationwide boom-bust cycle**. Massive defaults, bankruptcies, collapse of real estate and commodity prices. Export staples index fell from 158 to 77 (Nov 1818–Jun 1819), an annualized drop of 87.9%. Imports crashed from $122M to $87M. Western areas reverted to barter — grain and whiskey used as money.

> "The Bank was saved, and the people were ruined." — William Gouge

#### The Jacksonian Movement and the Bank War

- The **Panic of 1819** converted a generation of leaders to hard money: Andrew Jackson, Senator Thomas Hart "Old Bullion" Benton (Missouri), future President James K. Polk, economists Amos Kendall and **Condy Raguet**. They adopted the **Currency School** analysis: boom-bust cycles are caused by inflationary bank credit expansion followed by contraction.
- Rothbard emphasizes the Jacksonians have been **grossly misunderstood** by historians — depicted as "ignorant anti-capitalist agrarians" or an "electoral machine." In reality, they were **libertarians**: favoring free enterprise, free markets, minimal government, separation of government from banking, and hard money (pure specie or 100%-reserve-backed paper).
- The Jacksonian program: abolish central banking, eliminate fractional reserve banking, drastically lower tariffs, pay off the federal debt (accomplished for the first and probably last time in American history), and separate government from the banking system.
- **Nicholas Biddle**, the imperious head of the Second Bank (and heir to the Philadelphia elite chain from Morris → Girard → Willing → Jones), forced an early showdown by filing for recharter in 1831. Jackson **vetoed** the recharter bill in 1832; Congress failed to override.
- In 1833, Jackson removed Treasury deposits from the Bank and placed them in state **"pet banks"** (originally 7, eventually 91 by end of 1836). Biddle secured a Pennsylvania charter, and the Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania continued as a powerful but diminished state bank.

#### Debunking the Orthodox Narrative of the 1830s Boom

- **Orthodox historians** blame Jackson: by destroying the restraining central bank and freeing the state banks, he supposedly unleashed wild inflation that caused the panics of 1837 and 1839. **Recent scholarship (Temin) completely reverses this.**
- The inflation really began **before** Jackson removed the deposits. Wholesale prices rose 20.7% from July 1830 to fall 1833, driven by a money supply increase from $109M to $159M (45.9%) — **spurred by the still-dominant Second Bank**, which increased its notes and deposits from $29M to $42.1M (45.2%).
- Under the regime of conservative **Langdon Cheves** (1820–23), the Bank's expansion was modest (5.9% annually). Under the inflationist **Biddle** (after January 1823), the Bank expanded at **27.9% annually** — the Bank was the *driving force* of inflation, not a restraint on it.
- By 1832, both the Bank's reserve ratio (0.17) and the national banking system's reserve ratio (0.15) had fallen sharply. **Both sets of institutions had inflated almost precisely proportionately on top of specie.**
- After 1833, state banks' **reserve ratio remained virtually unchanged at 0.16** — they did no more pyramiding than before. The 1833–37 inflation ($150M → $267M, 84% increase, 21% per annum) was caused by a **massive inflow of specie** (from $31M to $73M, a 141.9% increase, 35.5% per annum), not by freed state banks running wild.
- State banks **overwhelmingly supported** the Second Bank (Biddle: "state banks in the main are friendly") — contradicting the myth that they were hostile to the central bank and eager to be freed from its restraints.

#### The Specie Inflow and the Real Causes of the 1837 Panic

- The enormous specie increase came from: (1) a **large influx of Mexican silver** — caused by the Santa Anna regime's debased copper coinage, which via Gresham's Law drove silver and gold out of Mexico into the U.S.; and (2) **reduced silver exports to the Orient** (China was buying opium instead of silver).
- **The Specie Circular** (1836) — Jackson's decree requiring specie payment for public lands — has been blamed for the panic, but recent studies show it had **very little impact** on bank reserves.
- The real **precipitating factor**: the **Bank of England**, worried about British inflation, tightened credit in the latter half of 1836. This restricted American cotton exports, caused capital outflows to England, and put severe contractionary pressure on American banks.
- In May 1837, banks (including the Bank of the United States) **suspended specie payments**. During 1837, the money supply fell from $276M to $232M (15.6%). Wholesale prices fell over 30% in seven months (index 131→98).

#### The 1838 Boomlet and 1839 Crash

- Britain resumed easy credit in 1838, sparking a short-lived American boomlet. The money supply rose 25% and prices recovered to 125 by February 1839.
- State governments recklessly spent a distributed federal surplus on wasteful public works, borrowing against expectations of foreign credit. Total state indebtedness skyrocketed from $12.8M (1820) to $170M (1839).
- The **Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania**, heavily invested in cotton speculation, was forced to suspend payments again in October 1839, triggering a wave of bank suspensions. The Bank finally closed its doors — ending the last central bank experiment.
- **1839–1843**: four years of massive monetary and price deflation. Money supply fell from $240M to $158M (34% drop). Prices fell from 125 to 67 (42% drop). Banks fell by 23%. Four western/southern states (Mississippi, Arkansas, Michigan, Florida) **repudiated** their debts; six others defaulted temporarily.

#### Comparing 1839–1843 to 1929–1933

- Temin's striking comparison: the percentage deflation was **almost identical** (money supply fell ~34% in 1839–43 vs. ~27% in 1929–33; prices fell ~42% vs. ~31%). But the real-economy effects were vastly different:
  - **1929–33**: investment fell 91%, consumption fell 19%, real GNP fell 30%.
  - **1839–43**: investment fell only 23%, consumption *increased* 21%, real GNP *increased* 16%.
- The difference: **19th-century price and wage flexibility** allowed the monetary contraction to lower prices without crippling production. In the 1930s, government-imposed rigidities (wage floors, price supports, regulations) turned the deflation into a catastrophic depression.

#### The Independent Treasury System

- The Jacksonians never intended a permanent system of pet banks. Under **Martin Van Buren**, they established the **Independent Treasury System** — the federal government kept its funds purely in specie in its own Treasury vaults and "subtreasury" branches, with no connection to any bank.
- This achieved the Jacksonian dream: **complete separation of government from banking**, with government finances on a purely hard-money, specie basis. The system lasted until the Civil War.

### The Jacksonians and the Coinage Legislation of 1834

- The Coinage Act of 1792 had set a 15-to-1 silver/gold ratio, but the world market ratio had shifted to ~15.75-to-1 by 1805, causing gold to be undervalued at the mint and driven out of circulation. After 1810, only silver coin (mostly lightweight Spanish fractional coins) circulated.
- The Jacksonians wanted to shift the U.S. effectively to a **gold standard** — gold was less susceptible to fractional-reserve-banking inflation because banks predominantly held silver as reserves.
- The **Coinage Act of 1834** devalued the gold dollar from 24.75 to 23.2 grains (a 6.26% debasement), changing the mint ratio from 15-to-1 to **16-to-1**. Silver was left at 371.25 grains. The new ratio slightly overvalued gold (the market ratio was ~15.79-to-1 in 1833), and for two decades both gold and silver successfully circulated side by side.
- The Jacksonians also passed companion acts legalizing **all foreign gold and silver coins** as legal tender and established **branch mints** in Georgia, North Carolina, and New Orleans to coin newly discovered gold.
- The Jacksonians sought to **tax small bank notes** and prevent the federal government from accepting them, to force actual specie into the hands of ordinary Americans. Though only partially successful at the federal level, the Independent Treasury and Specie Circular stopped bank note acceptance for government purposes.

#### The End of Bimetallism and the Coinage Act of 1853

- In the early 1850s, massive **gold discoveries** in California, Russia, and Australia (production surged from $12.8M/year average to a peak of $155M in 1853) crashed the gold-silver ratio. Silver became undervalued at the 16-to-1 mint ratio, and Gresham's Law drove silver out of circulation — first heavy Spanish dollars, then American silver dollars, then even fractional silver coins.
- By 1852, America faced a **small-coin crisis**: gold coins flooded in but were too valuable for small transactions. Millions in unauthorized small private paper notes appeared. The Jacksonians were losing the fight for hard-money small denominations.
- The ideal free-market solution was **"parallel standards"** (or "free metallism") — gold and silver each circulating at freely fluctuating market exchange rates, with the dollar defined as a weight of one metal only. This had worked in colonial America and in medieval Genoa.
- Instead, Congress chose **de facto gold monometallism** in February 1853: fractional silver coins were debased by 6.91%, making them overvalued "subsidiary" or "token" coinage (legal tender up to $5 only). With silver commanding a 4% premium over gold, the 3% debasement kept fractional silver in circulation. The small-coin problem was solved by early 1854.
- In 1857, Congress repealed the **legal tender status of foreign coins** — an exercise of monetary nationalism that undid part of the Jacksonian program.

### Decentralized Banking from the 1830s to the Civil War

- After the central bank was eliminated, the battle for hard money shifted to the **state level**. In the 1830s, 10 states prohibited bank notes under $5; five more restricted them. The Democratic Party fought to outlaw all fractional reserve bank paper at state constitutional conventions in the 1840s. By the eve of the Civil War, 18 of 33 states had adopted "free" banking laws.
- Pre-Civil War **"free" banking was not genuinely free**. It was "Decentralization without Freedom" — banks still received periodic general suspension of specie payments, their notes were accepted for taxes, interstate branch banking was generally prohibited (hindering redemption), state usury laws encouraged risky lending, and state government bonds served as the reserve base for pyramiding bank notes and deposits. Government debt and bank inflation were **intimately linked**.

### A Free-Market "Central Bank": The Suffolk System

- The **Suffolk Bank** of Boston (1818–1858) was a remarkable free-market institution — a private bank that voluntarily brought order and discipline to all of New England's banking system.
- **Problem**: Country bank notes circulated in Boston at discounts of 1–5% because distance made specie redemption difficult. Country banks exploited this by issuing far more notes than their capital warranted.
- **Solution**: In 1824, the Suffolk and six other Boston banks formed the **Associated Banks**, pooling $300,000 to systematically buy country bank notes and send them back for specie redemption. By 1825, the Suffolk handled $2 million in country notes per month. By 1838, almost all New England banks redeemed through the Suffolk.
- **The system's rules** (1825–1858): each country bank maintained a permanent specie deposit at Suffolk (minimum $2,000) plus enough to redeem all notes Suffolk received. In exchange, Suffolk accepted all member bank notes **at par** and credited depositor accounts the following day — functioning as a **clearinghouse**.
- **Stabilizing effects**: The Suffolk's power to grant or deny membership kept banks honest. Mismanaged banks were stricken from the approved list, causing their notes to trade at a discount. Suffolk also controlled **overdrafts** — profligate banks were denied overdraft privileges, forcing them to hold more liquid assets.
- **Results**: New England became an island of monetary stability. In the Panic of 1837, not one Connecticut bank failed or suspended. In 1857, when specie was suspended in Maine, all but three banks remained in business. Banking power grew faster per capita in New England than any other region (1803–1850).
- **The Suffolk vs. the National Banking System**: At its 1858 peak, the Suffolk redeemed $400 million per year at a cost of 10 cents per $1,000 — vs. the National Banking System's average of only $54 million per year at 90 cents per $1,000. The average New England bank note was redeemed **once every five weeks**.
- **Suffolk's demise** (1858): Its profits and power attracted a competitor — the **Bank for Mutual Redemption** (1858), backed by country banks resentful of Suffolk's strictness. Suffolk acted with spite rather than conciliation, refused to honor the newcomer's deposits, and was abandoned by country banks. The Civil War (1861) ended all specie payments, and the National Banking Act of 1863 forbade state bank notes entirely. But while it lasted, Suffolk proved that **private enterprise could provide efficient, safe clearinghouse services** far better than government.

### The Civil War

- The Civil War had an even more fateful monetary impact than the War of 1812. It put the U.S. on an **irredeemable fiat standard** for the first time since 1814–17 — but this time for **two decades**. It ended the Jacksonian separation of government from banking, creating a quasi-centralized **National Banking System** that paved the way for the Federal Reserve.
- The **Republican Party** inherited the Whig tradition of soft money and government-banking symbiosis, permanently implanting it in the American system.

#### Greenbacks

- Federal expenditures ballooned from $66 million (1861) to $1.30 billion (four years later). Secretary of the Treasury **Salmon P. Chase** (ironically a former Jacksonian) tried to float $150 million in bonds purchased by banks paying in specie — this drained bank reserves, and a general **suspension of specie payments** occurred in December 1861. The Treasury followed by suspending its own specie payments.
- The **Legal Tender Act** (February 1862) authorized $150 million in "United States notes" — **greenbacks** — as legal tender for all debts, public and private (except customs duties and interest on government bonds, which remained payable in gold). Congress initially resolved this would be a one-time emergency, then authorized two more $150 million issues. Greenbacks peaked at **$415.1 million** outstanding in 1864.
- Greenbacks depreciated immediately. Chase blamed "gold speculators" rather than his own inflation, and waged a campaign to **control, assault, and eliminate the gold market**: a stamp tax on gold sales (March 1863), prohibition of collateral loans on coin above par, and an attempt to undercut gold by allowing importers to deposit greenbacks at the Treasury for gold at below-market rates. All these schemes failed or backfired — the greenback fell from 59 cents in gold to 57 cents within weeks of the customs-duties scheme, which had to be repealed.
- Chase escalated further: sold $11M in gold to drive down the premium (trifling impact — Treasury needed gold for bond interest), sold foreign exchange in London at below-market rates (failed), then pushed through a **"gold bill"** (June 1864) prohibiting under severe penalties all gold futures contracts and all sales of gold by brokers outside their own offices. **Result: disaster.** The gold market collapsed into chaos, the greenback plummeted from 52¢ to 40¢ in gold within weeks, businessmen demanded repeal, and the bill was hastily reversed at the end of June. Chase was ousted from office.

> "Gold does not fluctuate in price... because they gamble in it; but they gamble in it because it fluctuates. But the fluctuation is not in the gold; the fluctuation is in the currency." — Senator Jacob Collamer

#### Greenback-Driven Gresham's Law

- As greenbacks depreciated below 97¢ in gold (July 1862), **fractional silver coins** became undervalued and were exported for gold. By July 1862, no coin higher than the copper-nickel penny remained in circulation. The government filled the gap with postage stamps, then fractional paper notes ($28 million by mid-1864). Even nickel-copper pennies eventually disappeared as greenbacks fell further. A debased bronze penny (spring 1864) finally alleviated the small-coin crisis.
- **California** was the fascinating exception: with few banks (banned by the 1849 constitution) and plentiful gold from the 1840s discoveries, California merchants in November 1862 **voluntarily agreed to refuse greenbacks** at anything but depreciated market value, maintaining gold as the monetary standard. The legislature passed a **"specific contracts act"** (April 1863) allowing gold-payment clauses in contracts. Private banks refused greenback deposits, newspapers warned against them, and the state government refused them for taxes. **Oregon** followed California's lead. Both states maintained a gold standard throughout the war.

#### Civil War Monetary Inflation — The Numbers

- Total money supply rose from **$745.4M (1860) to $1.773 billion** by war's end — an increase of 137.9%, or **27.69% per annum**. Wholesale prices rose from index 100 to 210.9, a rise of 110.9% (22.2% per year).
- The "necessity" argument for greenbacks was spurious — greenbacks were virtually not issued after mid-1863. Greenbacks financed only 22.8% of the deficit in fiscal 1862, 48.5% in 1863, 6.3% in 1864, and none in 1865. The government relied increasingly on bonds and taxes (revenue rose from $52M to $333.7M). The peak deficit ($963.8M, 1865) was financed entirely by debt.
- **State banks profited enormously** from greenbacks, using them as legal-tender reserves for pyramiding notes and deposits. State bank liabilities rose from $510M (1860) to $743M (1863) — a 15.2% annual increase. As Hammond noted: "Instead of being curbed... the powers of the banks were augmented by the legal tender issues."
- The **Confederacy's** inflation was far worse: money supply rose from $120.4M to $1.095 billion (1,060% increase, 302.9% per year). Prices rose from 100 to 9,211 in four years (9,100% increase, 2,275% per year).

### The Public Debt and the National Banking System

#### Jay Cooke: America's First Bond Salesman

- **Jay Cooke**, an Ohio-born investment banker, was the pivotal figure. His brother Henry was editor of the leading Republican newspaper in Ohio and a close friend of Senator Salmon P. Chase. The Cookes lobbied to make Chase Secretary of the Treasury; Chase's appointment was secured, and Jay Cooke immediately set up his own investment bank (Jay Cooke & Company).
- In fall 1862, Cooke persuaded Chase to grant him a **monopoly on underwriting the public debt**. Cooke pioneered mass-market bond sales — recruiting 2,500 sub-agents among bankers, insurance men, and community leaders; using lavish newspaper advertising, broadsides, and patriotic propaganda. Bond sales reached **$1–2 million per day**; perhaps $2 billion was sold during the war.
- Cooke emerged a millionaire ("as rich as Jay Cooke" became a catchphrase). He wielded enormous political influence — Treasury Secretaries Hugh McCulloch (1865–69) and later officials were close friends. Cooke's house crashed in the **Panic of 1873**.

#### Structure of the National Banking System

- Chase and Ohio Senator **John Sherman** drove through the **National Banking Acts** (1863–64), which destroyed the decentralized state banking system and replaced it with a centralized, inflationary system under Washington and Wall Street control. The effects of the national banking system outlasted the greenbacks and persisted until the Federal Reserve.
- The system created **three tiers** of national banks: (1) **Central reserve city** banks (New York only); (2) **Reserve city** banks (cities over 500,000); (3) **Country** banks (all others).
- **Reserve requirements**: Central reserve city banks: 25% vault cash. Reserve city banks: 25%, but half could be kept as deposits at New York banks. Country banks: 15%, with only 40% required in vault cash — the rest could be deposits at reserve city or central reserve city banks.
- This created an **inverted pyramid** of credit: all national banks pyramided on top of a few New York City banks' reserves (which could include greenbacks as well as specie). Before the Civil War, each bank stood alone on its own specie reserve. Now, $1 million in country bank vault cash could support $6 million in notes and deposits at the country level, plus $2.4 million at reserve city banks, plus $1.2 million at New York banks — and further expansions rippled outward.
- **Bank notes were tied to government bonds**: each national bank could issue notes only up to 90% of the value of U.S. government bonds it had deposited as collateral at the Treasury. This intimately linked the banking system to the public debt — the more government bonds purchased, the more money created. Government debt and bank inflation were **permanently fused**.
- Every national bank was obliged to redeem every other national bank's notes at par — abolishing the market discipline of depreciation-by-distance. The government conferred **quasi-legal tender** status by accepting all national bank notes and deposits for taxes. Despite these privileges, national bank notes fell below par with greenbacks in the financial crisis of 1867.
- **Branch banking remained illegal** (interstate and even intrastate), hobbling the clearing system. The redemption of notes was further crippled by a federal limit of $3 million per month in national bank note contraction.
- **Reserve requirements acted as an inflationary floor**, not a ceiling: free competition tends to produce *higher* reserve ratios (banks voluntarily hold more for safety), but a legal minimum pushes all banks *down* to that minimum — all banks became perpetually "fully loaned up."
- In June 1874, Congress eliminated reserve requirements on notes (keeping them only on deposits), releasing $20 million in reserves for further pyramiding.

#### The Fate of State Banks

- The national system was meant to replace state banks. When many refused to join (the requirements were more onerous), Congress in March 1865 imposed a **prohibitive 10% tax on all state bank notes**, effectively outlawing them. From 1865 on, national banks had a legal monopoly on note issue.
- State banks initially contracted sharply (1,466 → 297 from 1863–66; notes and deposits from $733M → $101M). But within a few years, state banks adapted by expanding **demand deposits** (not taxed) and became the **fourth layer** of the national pyramid — keeping reserves as deposits at national banks. By 1873, there were 1,330 state banks with $789 million in deposits.

## Part 2: The Origins of the Federal Reserve

### The Progressive Movement

- The **Federal Reserve Act** (December 23, 1913) was part of the broader Progressive wave of legislation — local, state, and federal — that began around 1900. Progressivism was a **bipartisan movement** that transformed the American economy from roughly laissez-faire to centralized statism in two decades.
- The old myth: Progressivism was a grassroots uprising of workers and farmers, guided by altruistic experts, that overcame big-business opposition to curb monopoly. **The reality is the reverse**: business became increasingly competitive in the late 19th century, and big-business interests (led by J.P. Morgan) tried desperately to establish cartels through voluntary means — quota systems, price-fixing, mergers — all of which collapsed under competitive pressure.
- Having failed at voluntary cartelization, big business turned to the **coercive power of government** to establish and maintain cartels. The trick was to redefine "monopoly" — traditionally meaning government-granted exclusive privilege — as simply "big business" or competitive practices like price-cutting. Regulatory commissions (ICC, FTC, state insurance commissions) were lobbied for and staffed by the very industries they regulated, all in the name of "opposing monopoly."

> Monopoly could be put over *in the name of* opposition to monopoly! The *form* of the political economy could be maintained, while the *content* could be totally reversed.

- **Intellectuals** were essential partners. The enormous growth of academics, technocrats, and professionals in the late 19th century created a class eager for government licensing, cartelization, and prestige. They served as ideological apologists for the new statism, having learned in German graduate schools the doctrines of organicist socialism — a "middle way" between laissez-faire and Marxism.
- Statism arrived after 1900 not because of inflation or deflation, but because a unique set of conditions had destroyed the Democrats as a laissez-faire party, leaving a **power vacuum** for the new corporate statist ideology of compulsory cartelization — a partnership of big government, business, unions, technocrats, and intellectuals.

### Unhappiness with the National Banking System

- The Civil War's most lasting monetary intervention was the **National Banking Acts** (1863–65), which destroyed state bank note issuance via a prohibitory 10% tax and monopolized note issue in federally chartered national banks centered on Wall Street. National banks were compelled by law to accept each other's notes at par — abolishing the free market's discipline of discounting inflated banks' notes.
- The national banking system was a **halfway house** between free banking and full central banking. By the end of the 19th century, Wall Street banks were increasingly unhappy:
  - There was no central bank to **coordinate inflation** and act as lender of last resort — bank-credit booms inevitably turned into recessions.
  - **State banks** had grown rapidly by pyramiding demand deposits on top of national bank notes, providing stiff competition. St. Louis, Chicago, and other cities' bank deposits rose from 16% (1880) to 33% (1912) of the national total. Bank clearings outside New York rose from 24% (1882) to 43% (1913).
- The big banks' complaint was summed up in one word: **"inelasticity."** The national banking system did not allow sufficient room for inflationary credit expansion.

### The Morgan-Rockefeller Financial Blocs

- By 1900, American political economy was dominated by **two clashing financial aggregations**:
  1. **The Morgan group** — previously dominant, began in investment banking, expanded into commercial banking, railroads, and manufacturing mergers.
  2. **The Rockefeller forces** — began in oil refining, moved into commercial banking, allied with **Kuhn, Loeb & Company** (investment banking) and the **Harriman interests** (railroads).
- Though they clashed, both agreed on the need for a **central bank**. The eventual Federal Reserve was shaped by both groups collaborating on what they considered essential monetary reform.
- The Morgans favored a **gold standard** — not as genuine hard money, but as a "camouflage" behind which they could build a far more controlled inflationary system. A controlled Morgan-Rockefeller gold standard was "far more pernicious to the cause of genuine hard money than a candid free-silver or greenback Bryanism."

> Much of the political history of the United States from the late nineteenth century until World War II may be interpreted by the closeness of each administration to one of these sometimes cooperating, more often conflicting, financial groupings: Cleveland (Morgan), McKinley (Rockefeller), Theodore Roosevelt (Morgan), Taft (Rockefeller), Wilson (Morgan), Harding (Rockefeller), Coolidge (Morgan), Hoover (Morgan), and Franklin Roosevelt (Harriman–Kuhn, Loeb–Rockefeller).

### The Beginnings of the "Reform" Movement: The Indianapolis Monetary Convention

- After the **1896 election** (McKinley vs. Bryan), the Morgan-Rockefeller forces organized a "reform" movement to cure the "inelasticity" of the gold standard and move toward a central bank. The crucial point: **avoid the appearance of Wall Street/banker control** by acquiring the patina of a Midwestern grassroots movement.
- **Hugh Henry Hanna**, president of Atlas Engine Works of Indianapolis, sent a memorandum to the Indianapolis Board of Trade urging a grassroots Midwestern state to lead currency reform. Delegates from 12 Midwestern boards of trade met on December 1, 1896, and called for a large monetary convention.
- The **Indianapolis Monetary Convention** (January 12, 1897) brought representatives from 26 states. Despite the grassroots veneer, the executive committee was packed with Morgan and Rockefeller associates:
  - **H.H. Kohlsaat** — editor of the *Chicago Times-Herald*, friend and adviser of Rockefeller, main man in politics for President McKinley
  - **Alexander E. Orr** — NYC banker in the Morgan ambit, director of Morgan-run railroads
  - **Henry C. Payne** — Republican leader from Milwaukee, deeply tied to Morgan utilities and railroads
  - **George Foster Peabody** — eminent NYC investment banker, closely associated with the Morgan family (the Peabody banking firm was where J.P. Morgan's father had been a senior partner)
  - **Franklin MacVeagh** — wholesale grocer from Chicago, uncle of a senior partner in Morgan's Wall Street law firm, later Taft's Secretary of the Treasury
- The convention resolved to (1) continue the gold standard and (2) create a new system of "elastic" bank credit. McKinley approved, but a bill for a national monetary commission died in the Senate.
- Failing to get a presidentially appointed commission, the executive committee **appointed its own** — meeting at the Saratoga Springs summer home of Morgan's investment banking partner Spencer Trask.

#### The Indianapolis Monetary Commission

- The commission was chaired by former Senator **George F. Edmunds** (Vermont), a railroad director. Members included Morgan-connected bankers, railroad attorneys, and corporate leaders from across the country.
- The key working member: **James Laurence Laughlin**, head professor of political economy at the Rockefeller-founded University of Chicago, editor of the *Journal of Political Economy*. Laughlin supervised all operations and report-writing. His two staff assistants were his own students: **L. Carroll Root** and **Henry Parker Willis** (who would later draft the Federal Reserve Act itself).
- **$50,000** was raised from the banking/corporate community to finance the commission — with major contributions from Morgan bankers Peabody and Orr, mining magnate William E. Dodge, and J.P. Morgan personally.
- The commission developed new methods of **molding public opinion**: hired financial journalist **Charles A. Conant** to propagandize; built a distribution network reaching 100,000 correspondents and 7,500 newspapers; orchestrated letters of support from prominent men timed to coincide with publication of the preliminary report (January 3, 1898).
- The preliminary report's immediate emphasis was codifying the **gold standard** (a mopping-up operation after Bryan's defeat). More important in the long run was the call for banking reform to allow **greater credit elasticity** — the real goal being to loosen constraints on bank credit expansion.
- A second, grander convention (January 25, 1898) brought **496 delegates** from 31 states — a cross-section of America's top corporate leaders, all presenting the appearance of a broad-based movement while in reality being orchestrated by Morgan-Rockefeller financial interests.
- Prominent academic economists attended as delegates — not as observers but as representatives of business associations: **Jeremiah W. Jenks** (Cornell) from the Ithaca Business Men's Association, **Frank W. Taussig** (Harvard) from the Cambridge Merchants' Association, **Arthur Twining Hadley** (Yale, soon president) from the New Haven Chamber of Commerce. All held powerful posts in the organized economics profession and on the AEA currency committee.
- Taussig and Taylor were monetary theorists who, while committed to the gold standard, wanted the money supply made more "elastic." Taylor wanted "a conscious control of the movement of money" by government and justified government **suspensions of specie payment** to "protect the gold reserve."
- The commission's **final report** (Laughlin's work) came out in favor of a broadened asset base for national bank notes and **explicitly called for a central bank** that would enjoy a monopoly of note issue.

#### Legislative Battles: The Fowler Bill and the Aldrich Bill

- **A. Barton Hepburn**, president of Chase National Bank (Morgan flagship), invited the commission to address the New York State Bankers Association — "bankers, like other people, need instruction upon this subject."
- The lobbying team of **Hanna and Conant** pushed a bill (introduced by Indiana Congressman Jesse Overstreet) embodying the commission's suggestions. Conant met continuously with the House Banking Committee; Hanna organized 100,000 correspondents for letter-writing campaigns.
- **Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage** (Rockefeller camp — president of First National Bank of Chicago, friend of Mark Hanna) tried to operate the Treasury as a **proto-central bank**: purchasing government bonds on the open market in recessions, depositing large funds with pet commercial banks. In 1901, he openly called for a government central bank.
- When Gage left office, he became president of the Rockefeller-controlled **U.S. Trust Company** in New York.
- After the 1898 elections, the **Gold Standard Act** (March 1900) was passed. It codified the gold standard — but also contained less-noticed clauses making it far easier for national banks to issue notes and expand in small towns, beginning the march toward "elastic" currency.
- Taussig praised the act but declared it was only "the first step" — fundamental banking reform was still needed for "more and greater expansion of bank credit and the supply of money."
- The **Fowler Bill** (1902): drawn up by Hepburn (Morgan's Chase National Bank) as head of an ABA commission. Three clauses: (1) further expansion of bank notes on broader assets, (2) allow national banks to establish **branches** at home and abroad (favored by big banks, fiercely opposed by small country bankers), (3) create a three-member board within the Treasury to supervise new bank notes and establish clearinghouse associations — designed as the **first step toward a full central bank**.
- Small country bankers killed the Fowler Bill in the House during 1902 through the American Bankers Association, despite agitation by the Indianapolis Monetary Convention's staff.
- **Senator Nelson W. Aldrich** (Rhode Island) — perennial Republican leader, Rockefeller's man in Congress, and future father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr. — submitted the **Aldrich Bill** allowing large national banks to issue "emergency currency" based on municipal and railroad bonds. Even this was defeated.
- Two Morgan men (**J.P. Morgan and George F. Baker**) and two Rockefeller men (**Frank Vanderlip and James Stillman**) met with Comptroller of the Currency **William B. Ridgely** in January 1903 to urge restricting country bank loans — this too bore no fruit.

#### Secretary Shaw and the Proto-Central Bank

- **Leslie Shaw**, secretary of the Treasury under Theodore Roosevelt, continued and expanded Gage's experiments in using the Treasury as a central bank: open market bond purchases in recessions, depositing Treasury funds in favored big national banks, artificially lowering interest rates.
- Shaw violated the statutory Independent Treasury system, which had confined government revenues to its own coffers. Banking reformers themselves criticized these manipulations as arbitrary and destabilizing.
- In his 1906 annual report, Shaw urged that he be given **total power to regulate all the nation's banks**. By then, it was clear to the reformers that proto-central bank manipulations via the Treasury had failed — a fundamental legislative overhaul was needed to bring the banking system under **central banking control**.

### Charles A. Conant, Surplus Capital, and Economic Imperialism

- The years around 1900 also saw the origin of the **gold-exchange standard** — the fateful system later imposed on the world by Britain in the 1920s and by the U.S. at Bretton Woods. Combined with a central bank, the gold-exchange standard establishes coordinated **international inflationary paper money** in the name of gold.
- The gold-exchange standard replaces a genuine gold standard (each bank/country holds its own gold reserves) with a **pseudo-gold standard** in which client countries hold reserves not in gold but in the key currency (pounds or dollars) of the dominant country. Client countries pyramid their own inflation on top of the key country's inflation — creating a global inflationary system bound to collapse, as it did in the 1930s Depression and the late 1960s (Bretton Woods).
- By the late 1890s, groups of theoreticians in the U.S. were developing what would later be called the **"Leninist" theory of capitalist imperialism** — but it originated not with Lenin but with Morgan-oriented friends and brain trusters of Theodore Roosevelt: **Henry Adams, Brooks Adams, Admiral Alfred T. Mahan**, and Senator **Henry Cabot Lodge**.
- The theory: capitalism in developed countries was "overproducing" — not just needing more purchasing power in recessions, but facing a permanently **falling rate of profit** due to "surplus capital." The solution: Western governments must engage in **imperialist ventures** to force open foreign markets and investment outlets, saving capitalism from itself.
- **Charles A. Conant** articulated this theory in *A History of Modern Banks of Issue* (1896) and subsequent essays. He claimed that fixed capital and modern technology invalidated Say's Law, creating chronic "oversavings" and business cycles inherent in unregulated capitalism. Hence the importance of government-encouraged monopolies, cartels, and imperialism.
- Conant enthusiastically supported the **Spanish-American War** (1898) and U.S. retention of the Philippines as "the gateway to the great potential Asian market." He argued America should not be held back by the Founding Fathers' doctrines about consent of the governed — self-government applied only to races "competent to exercise it."
- Conant also drew domestic conclusions: society must be made "as efficient as possible" through centralized concentration of power. He admired **Czarist Russia's** centralization and suggested the U.S. Constitution would have to be amended to permit "a form of czarist absolutism."

#### The Economists and Imperialism

- A legion of economists trained in German graduate schools eagerly embraced the new statism. **Edwin R.A. Seligman** (Columbia) hailed the "new industrial order" in a 1903 AEA presidential address, prophesying that economic knowledge would grant economists power "to control and mold the material forces of progress."
- **Arthur Twining Hadley** (Yale president) saw economists as society's philosopher-kings, declaring their future lay "not in theories but in practice, not with students but with statesmen . . . in the leadership of an organized body politic."
- The **American Economic Association** created a special committee to organize and publish a volume on colonial finance (*Essays in Colonial Finance*, 1900), chaired by **Jeremiah W. Jenks** (adviser to TR as governor). The AEA found five wealthy businessmen — including **Isaac N. Seligman** (J. and W. Seligman), **William E. Dodge** (Morgan-allied mining), and **Theodore Marburg** (AEA vice president, American Tobacco heir) — to finance publication.
- The volume's recommendations: colonies should support their imperial government through taxation; the imperial center should build infrastructure; where native labor was deemed inadequate, import white labor. As the authors put it, "trained economists were necessary for a successful empire."

### Conant, Monetary Imperialism, and the Gold-Exchange Standard

- The leap into political imperialism (Spanish-American War, 1898) was accompanied by **monetary imperialism**. The gold-exchange standard was the key tool. Instead of shifting Third World silver countries to a genuine gold-coin standard, U.S. bankers/economists pushed a **"gold-exchange" or dollar standard**: silver countries would keep debased silver coins, but their reserves would be held not in gold or silver but in **dollars deposited at New York banks** — allegedly redeemable in gold.
- This meant: (a) Third World economies were tied to the U.S. monetary system, (b) those economies could pyramid their own inflation on top of U.S. inflation, and (c) U.S. banks inflating their credit faced **no danger of losing gold abroad** — unlike under a genuine gold standard where creditors would demand gold. The system was a revived form of bimetallism designed for imperial control.

#### Puerto Rico and the Philippines

- **Puerto Rico** (seized 1898): The easiest case. Spain had already debased Puerto Rican silver. The U.S. simply substituted its own debased silver dollar (worth 45.6¢ in gold) for the even more debased Spanish one. The exchange rate between peso and dollar was split between debtor and creditor interests at **60¢ per peso**.
- **The Philippines** (seized 1898): A far harder problem. Filipinos used the sound, full-bodied **Mexican silver dollar**, dominant throughout the Far East. The Bureau of Insular Affairs (War Department) hired **Charles A. Conant** to devise the currency reform. Secretary of War **Elihu Root** (Morgan's personal attorney) took a personal hand.
- Conant's cunning plan: let Filipinos keep silver coins, but replace the full-bodied Mexican dollar with a **debased American silver coin** tied to gold at a value far below the market silver-gold ratio. Gresham's Law would drive out the overvalued silver and keep gold out of circulation. The **seigniorage profit** from debasement would be deposited at a New York bank as the "reserve" for U.S. silver currency in the Philippines — enabling the U.S. to issue paper dollars based on this reserve fund.
- Congress, pressured by the silver lobby, initially balked. Conant swung into action: secured editorial promises from financial journal editors, warned recalcitrant U.S. bankers in Manila they'd lose government deposits, and won over silver companies by promising the government would buy their silver for the new Philippine coinage. Congress passed the **Philippine Currency Bill** in March 1903.
- In practice, the scheme ran into trouble: Filipinos preferred the familiar Mexican coins, and Gresham's Law worked against the U.S. coins. The U.S. banned Mexican coin importation, removed their legal tender status, and imposed severe taxes on private Mexican coin transactions. By 1905, through force, luck, and trickery — including making the new U.S. coins look like old Mexican ones (Filipinos called them **"conants"**) — the new currency prevailed.

#### Mexico, China, Cuba, and Beyond

- **Mexico** (Currency Reform Act of 1905): More gratifying to Conant — Mexico's own Finance Minister **Limantour** effected the reform, with the CIE taking a back seat. Success was aided by a world rise in silver prices making gold coins cheaper than silver (Gresham's Law working in the reformers' favor). Rothbard speculates the U.S.-led currency manipulation may have been one cause of the **Mexican Revolution of 1910**.
- **China**: The big failure. After the **Boxer Rebellion** (1900), the three intervening powers (Britain, Japan, U.S.) forced China to pay a $333 million indemnity. **Jeremiah W. Jenks** was sent to China in 1904 to transform it to a gold-exchange standard. Total failure: Chinese officials saw through the scheme, denouncing it as an "irresponsible and immoral debasement" that would impoverish China while enriching U.S. banks where seigniorage reserves would be deposited. China instead adopted its own nationalistic currency reform (the **tael**) in 1905.
- **Panama**: Easy — the U.S. occupied the Canal Zone and simply imposed the gold dollar. A debased silver peso (worth 50¢) was imposed as the medium of exchange, similar enough to the old Colombian coin that the takeover went smoothly.
- **Cuba**: Conant's other big failure. Cuban nationalism resisted U.S. currency control. The sugar industry (Cuba's main export sector) opposed a shift to higher-valued gold money because it would raise their costs ~20%. U.S. investment in Cuban sugar ($95 million by WWI) created conflicting American interests on both sides of the reform question. Governor Charles Magoon opposed Conant's plan. Conant died in Cuba in 1915, still trying.
- **Dominican Republic** (1905): **Jacob Hollander** imposed the gold-exchange standard, then used his connections with Kuhn, Loeb to place Dominican bonds — double-dipping by collecting fees from both the State Department and the Dominican government. The scandal (discovered 1911) ended the government's ability to use its own employees for gold-exchange missions.
- **Nicaragua** (1911–12): The U.S. imposed a gold-exchange standard over great opposition, with the State Department approving Brown Brothers' hiring of Conant to negotiate. A public-private partnership — bankers supplied funds, the State Department supplied good will and diplomatic resources.
- Conant's **magnum opus**: *The Principles of Money and Banking* (1905). He argued that paper was the "most advanced" form of money — revealing that his devotion to the gold standard was only to a "debased and inflationary standard, controlled and manipulated by the U.S. government, with gold really serving as a façade."
- **Edwin W. Kemmerer**, Conant's true successor: taught at Cornell (under Jenks), then Princeton. Published *Modern Currency Reforms* (1916). As the leading foreign financial adviser of the 1920s, Kemmerer imposed central banks and gold-exchange standards on Third World countries while also getting them to levy higher taxes. He combined public employment with a retainer from investment bank **Dillon, Read** (1922–29). In the mid-1920s, Kemmerer served as president of the AEA.

### Jacob Schiff Ignites the Drive for a Central Bank

- The defeat of the Fowler Bill (1902) and the failure of Treasury Secretary Shaw's proto-central bank experiments (1903–06) convinced big bankers that a frank legislative drive for a **central bank** was necessary.
- The campaign was launched in **January 1906** by **Jacob H. Schiff**, head of the Wall Street investment bank **Kuhn, Loeb and Company**, in a speech before the New York Chamber of Commerce. Schiff complained that in autumn 1905, "the country needed money" but the Treasury contracted deposits in national banks, precipitating a "disgraceful" financial crisis with sky-high interest rates. An "elastic currency" and comprehensive banking reform were imperative.
- Behind the scenes: Schiff's partner **Paul Moritz Warburg**, who had emigrated from the German investment firm M.M. Warburg and Company in 1897, had been agitating for European-style central banking since at least 1903. (Schiff and Warburg were related by marriage through the Loeb family.)
- The New York Chamber of Commerce responded by creating a five-man special commission. Vanderlip (Rockefeller) proposed it consist of himself, Schiff, J.P. Morgan, George Baker (Morgan), and Lyman Gage (Rockefeller). Only Vanderlip was available; the final commission included **Isidore Straus** (R.H. Macy), two Morgan men (**Dumont Clarke** of American Exchange National Bank and **Charles A. Conant** of Morton Trust), and **John Claflin** (Indianapolis Monetary Convention veteran).
- Secretary: **Joseph French Johnson**, Vanderlip's old friend from the *Chicago Tribune*, now at NYU, who had been calling for a central bank since 1900.
- The commission used the old Indianapolis technique: questionnaires to financial leaders for legitimacy. Conant toured European central banks. The **October 1906 report** called for a "central bank of issue under the control of the government" and denounced Shaw's Treasury manipulations as arbitrary overinflation. The committee declared: "centralization of financial responsibility" was the critical need.

#### The ABA Currency Commission

- In 1905, the **American Bankers Association** appointed a currency committee, which recommended an emergency assets currency issued by a federal commission — resembling an embryonic central bank. The ABA convention rejected this plan in a tumultuous session (October 1906) but agreed to appoint a **15-man currency commission** to meet with the New York chamber committee.
- Prominent ABA commissioners:
  - **Arthur Reynolds** — Des Moines National Bank, Morgan-oriented, powerful ABA chairman
  - **James B. Forgan** — Rockefeller's First National Bank of Chicago, friend of Schiff and Vanderlip
  - **Joseph T. Talbert** — Rockefeller's Commercial National Bank of Chicago, soon vice president of National City Bank
  - **Myron T. Herrick** — leading Rockefeller politician, former Ohio governor, close to Mark Hanna and McKinley
  - **A. Barton Hepburn** — chairman, Morgan's Chase National Bank
- The ABA and New York chamber commissions agreed on a broader asset currency and emergency bank note provisions. Congress was presented with proposals in December 1906.
- But the reformers grew worried about **uncontrolled inflation**: if bank notes expanded on broader assets, small state banks could pyramid on top of expanded national bank notes, siphoning credit away from the large banks. The reformers emphatically did **not** want uncontrolled state bank inflation — they wanted credit expansion **controlled by and confined to the large national banks**. The decentralized U.S. commercial paper system (single-name, unendorsed paper) was another problem — unlike Europe's two-name acceptance paper, it was not subject to big-banker control.

### Paul Moritz Warburg and the Central Bank Campaign

- **Paul Moritz Warburg** of Kuhn, Loeb took the lead in addressing the problem of small banks and decentralization. In January 1907, he published two articles: "Defects and Needs of our Banking System" and "A Plan for a Modified Central Bank" — launching years of tireless agitation.
- Warburg openly called for a central bank whose functions would include: (a) **restricting the eligibility of bank assets** for deposit expansion (controlling what small banks could use as reserves), and (b) requiring banks to use **acceptance paper** (two-name, endorsed commercial paper) instead of the American single-name promissory note system — which would give the central bank and big acceptance banks control over credit flows.
- When the Fed was established, Warburg boasted of his crucial role in persuading it to create an acceptance market by purchasing acceptance paper from a few large acceptance banks at subsidized rates — providing "an unchecked channel for inflationary credit expansion" that helped pave the way for the 1929 crash. Warburg himself became chairman of the board of the **International Acceptance Bank** (1920), the world's largest acceptance bank.

### The Panic of 1907 and Mobilization for a Central Bank

- A severe financial crisis struck in early **October 1907** — general recession, contraction, and the usual government-permitted **suspension of specie payments** by major banks in New York and Chicago. The Treasury had stimulated inflation during 1905–07 but could not prevent the panic or alleviate "the competitive hoarding of currency" — i.e., the public demanding cash for increasingly shaky bank notes and deposits.
- Very quickly, banker and business opinion consolidated behind a central bank — a lender of last resort that could bail banks out. The reformers now faced two tasks: hammering out details and, more importantly, **mobilizing public opinion**.
- The alliance between **academia and the power elite** proved critical. Two organizations were particularly useful:
  - The **American Academy of Political and Social Science** (AAPSS) of Philadelphia
  - The **Academy of Political Science** (APS) of Columbia University
- **Nicholas Murray Butler**, president of Columbia, explained that the APS was "an intermediary between . . . the scholars and the men of affairs."
- Three symposia (winter 1907–08) by the AAPSS, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Columbia all called for a central bank. **E.R.A. Seligman** organized the Columbia conference, delighted that his university could be a platform for bankers and financial journalists.
- At the Columbia conference, **Seligman** declared the banking system's problem was its **decentralization** — "the struggle which has been victoriously fought everywhere else [in creating trusts] must be undertaken here in earnest and with vigor."
- **Frank Vanderlip** called the Panic of 1907 "one of the great calamities of history" caused by 15,000 banks all competing for reserves with "each institution standing alone." A central bank was needed to "mobilize and centralize reserves." In virtually Marxian terms, he declared the "alien external power of the free and competitive market must be replaced by central control."
- **A. Barton Hepburn** (Morgan's Chase National Bank) stressed the central bank must have a **monopoly of bank note issue** and be able to discount national bank assets — thus supplying "elastic currency."
- **Warburg** lectured on the superiority of European central banking, emphasizing that "small banks constitute a danger" and the free market in money must be replaced by "the best judgment of the best experts."

### The Aldrich-Vreeland Act and the National Monetary Commission

- In January 1908, **Senator Nelson W. Aldrich** (Rockefeller's man, father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr.) introduced the **Aldrich Bill** dealing with emergency currency provisions. A compromise with the House became the **Aldrich-Vreeland Act** (1908).
- The important part of Aldrich-Vreeland was not the emergency currency (used only once, briefly in 1914), but the establishment of a **National Monetary Commission** (NMC) to investigate the currency question and propose comprehensive banking reform. This was the apotheosis of the "clever commission" concept launched at Indianapolis a decade earlier.
- Aldrich wasted no time: he determined the NMC would be run as **an alliance of Morgan, Rockefeller, and Kuhn, Loeb people**. He told his House counterpart: "My idea is, of course, that everything shall be done in the most quiet manner possible, and without any public announcement."
- On J.P. Morgan's advice, seconded by Schiff, Aldrich chose **Henry P. Davison** — Morgan partner, founder of Morgan's Bankers Trust Company — as his top adviser. The official senators and representatives on the NMC were "mere window dressing."
- As director of research, **A. Piatt Andrew** of Harvard organized commission reports and studies. National City Bank's foreign exchange department wrote papers on bankers' acceptances; Warburg and Bankers Trust's Fred Kent wrote on the European discount market.
- By December 1908, the NMC hired **Charles A. Conant** for research, public relations, and agitprop. Aldrich expanded his inner circle to include Warburg and Vanderlip.
- **Warburg** formed a subcircle of friends from the New York Merchants' Association and top AEA economists (Seligman, Thomas Nixon Carver of Harvard, Henry R. Seager of Columbia, Davis R. Dewey of MIT, Oliver M.W. Sprague of Harvard, Frank W. Taussig of Harvard, **Irving Fisher** of Yale).
- In 1909, the reformers had to bring **James B. Forgan** (Rockefeller's First National Bank of Chicago) on board. Forgan recognized that his bank already performed quasi-central banking functions with country bank deposits and didn't want to lose that role. **George M. Reynolds**, in his September 1909 ABA presidential address, assured Forgan that the new central bank would act as depository only for the large central reserve city banks, while national banks would continue holding country bank deposits. Mollified, Forgan joined.
- As an outgrowth of Forgan's concerns, the reformers decided to cloak central control in a **"regionalism" and "decentralism"** disguise — establishing regional reserve banks that would appear independent but would be coordinated by a central control board. This, of course, was the scheme adopted in the Federal Reserve System. Morgan railroad attorney **Victor Morawetz** articulated this in a famous November 1909 speech.

### The Jekyll Island Meeting

- On September 14, 1909, **President Taft** publicly suggested the country consider establishing a central bank — the *Wall Street Journal* hailed this as "removing the subject from the realm of theory to that of practical politics."
- One week later (September 22, 1909), the *Wall Street Journal* began a **14-part front-page series** on "A Central Bank of Issue." These unsigned editorials were actually written by **Charles A. Conant**, salaried chief propagandist of the NMC.
- Conant, with Aldrich's secretary Arthur B. Shelton, prepared abstracts of commission materials for newspapers. Shelton recruited the head of the AP's Washington bureau, **J.P. Gavitt**, to scan commission materials for "newsy paragraphs" to feed newspaper editors.
- Academic organizations were "particularly helpful": the APS proposed to devote a special volume of its *Proceedings* to "popularize" the NMC's work — while maintaining supposed "objectivity" by avoiding specific policy recommendations. As APS secretary Robert E. Ely put it: "We shall not advocate a central bank, but we shall only give the best results of your work in condensed form and untechnical language."
- In spring 1910, the NMC poured out numerous research volumes to swamp public opinion with "scientific" and "value-free" scholarship — all designed to further the central bank agenda. Kemmerer's mammoth study of seasonal money demand variations was typical.
- The tangible plan phase began with a **November 1910 monetary conference** held by the APS, New York Chamber of Commerce, and Merchants' Association. NMC members were guests of honor; attendees included Vanderlip, Elihu Root, Thomas W. Lamont of the Morgans, Jacob Schiff, and **J.P. Morgan himself**.
- With the conference over, it was time for Aldrich and top leaders to **hammer out the actual bill in secret**. On **November 22, 1910**, Aldrich and a handful of companions set forth in a privately chartered railroad car from Hoboken, New Jersey, to the coast of Georgia, sailing to the exclusive **Jekyll Island Club** — facilities arranged by club member and co-owner J.P. Morgan. The cover story: a "duck-hunting expedition." Attendees addressed each other only by first name and took elaborate precautions for secrecy.
- The **six conferees** at Jekyll Island:
  1. **Senator Nelson W. Aldrich** (Rockefeller)
  2. **Henry P. Davison** (Morgan partner)
  3. **Paul Warburg** (Kuhn, Loeb)
  4. **Frank A. Vanderlip** (National City Bank — Rockefeller)
  5. **A. Piatt Andrew** (Harvard economist, NMC research director, now assistant Treasury secretary)
  6. **Charles D. Norton** (Morgan — president of First National Bank of New York)
- After a week of meetings, they forged the plan that became the **Aldrich Bill**. Vanderlip acted as secretary and did the final writing. The only disagreement was tactical: Aldrich wanted a straightforward European-style central bank; **Warburg and the bankers** insisted on cloaking central control in the politically palatable camouflage of "decentralization" — regional reserve banks that would appear independent but be centrally coordinated. Warburg and the bankers won.
- The bill's composition: **two Rockefeller men** (Aldrich, Vanderlip), **two Morgan men** (Davison, Norton), **one Kuhn, Loeb person** (Warburg), and **one economist** friendly to both camps (Andrew).

### The Final Phase: Coping with the Democratic Ascendancy

- Democrats swept the **1910 congressional elections**. Aldrich decided not to run for re-election. The reformers needed a full year of intensive propaganda to convert Democrats and the public before presenting the bill.
- In January 1911, Warburg established a **"monetary day"** devoted to the "Business Men's Monetary Conference," chaired by **C. Stuart Patterson** (of Indianapolis Monetary Convention fame). The conference adopted the Aldrich Plan and appointed **Warburg** to head a committee of seven to establish a reform league.
- The **National Citizens' League for the Creation of a Sound Banking System** was established in Chicago (not New York) to acquire a "grassroots" Midwestern patina — the old Indianapolis convention trick. Official heads were Chicago nonbanker industrialists; the director was **J. Laurence Laughlin** (University of Chicago), assisted by his former student **H. Parker Willis**. Willis later conceded the Citizens' League had been "a propaganda organ of the nation's bankers."
- The league's directors included B.E. Sunny (Chicago Telephone, Morgan), Cyrus McCormick (International Harvester, Morgan), John G. Shedd (Marshall Field), Frederic A. Delano (Wabash Railroad, Rockefeller), and Julius Rosenwald (Sears, Roebuck).
- In February 1911, Aldrich's inner circle organized a **closed-door conference of 23 top bankers** in Atlantic City — bank presidents from nine leading cities. The conference warmly endorsed the Aldrich Plan. **James B. Forgan** emerged as the most effective banker spokesman, presenting the plan to the ABA. By **November 1911**, the full ABA endorsed the Aldrich Plan.

> "The real purpose of the conference was to discuss winning the banking community over to government control directly by the bankers for their own ends. . . . It was generally appreciated that the [Aldrich Plan] would increase the power of the big national banks to compete with the rapidly growing state banks, help bring the state banks under control, and strengthen the position of the national banks in foreign banking activities." — Gabriel Kolko

### The Federal Reserve Act (December 1913)

- The **1912 elections** saw Woodrow Wilson win the presidency. The Aldrich Bill (introduced January 1912 by Theodore Burton) died quickly. But the reformers simply **dropped the Aldrich name**, made a few minor adjustments, and rebaptized the bill as a Democratic measure.
- This transformation was eased when **H. Parker Willis** was appointed administrative assistant to **Carter Glass**, the Democrat from Virginia who now headed the House Banking and Currency Committee. In an accident of history, Willis had taught economics to Carter Glass's two sons at Washington and Lee University — and they recommended him to their father.
- The splits between the Aldrich and Glass bills — which have fascinated historians — were "fundamentally trivial to the basic story." The bankers preferred the Fed board to be appointed by bankers; the political reformers recognized this was unpalatable and achieved the same result by having the president and Congress appoint the board, with bankers electing most regional Fed officials. **There was very little substantive difference** between the two plans.
- **A. Barton Hepburn** (Chase National Bank) told the ABA in August 1913: "The measure recognizes and adopts the principles of a central bank . . . it will make all incorporated banks together joint owners of a central dominating power."
- The **Federal Reserve Act** was passed in **December 1913**. Control was promptly handed to Morgan men, led by **Benjamin Strong** of Bankers Trust as all-powerful head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

### Conclusion

- The financial elites — notably the **Morgan, Rockefeller, and Kuhn, Loeb interests** — were responsible for putting through the Federal Reserve System as a **governmentally created and sanctioned cartel device** to enable the nation's banks to inflate the money supply in a coordinated fashion, without suffering quick retribution from depositors or noteholders demanding cash.
- Recent researchers have highlighted the vital supporting role of **technocratic experts and academics**, who lent their cloak of disinterested expertise to legitimize what was in essence a cartelization of the banking industry for the benefit of its most powerful members.

## Part 3: From Hoover to Roosevelt — The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elites

### The Two Great Financial Groupings

Rothbard argues that American politics from 1900 to World War II is best understood not through the superficial Democrat vs. Republican divide, but through the rivalry of two great **financial-industrial groupings**:

1. **The House of Morgan**: Began in investment banking, expanded into railroads, commercial banking, and manufacturing. Allies: Mellon (Pittsburgh), Coolidge administration, many Republican figures.
2. **The Rockefeller–Harriman–Kuhn, Loeb alliance**: Began in oil, railroads, and investment banking, then expanded into commercial banking. Allies: Harding, Standard Oil network, National City Bank.

- In most instances the two clashed (e.g., Theodore Roosevelt using antitrust against Standard Oil on Morgan's behalf; Taft targeting Morgan trusts on Rockefeller's behalf). But in key areas — especially the drive for the Federal Reserve — they cooperated.
- Both groups were heavily represented in the National Civic Federation and lobbied jointly for the Fed.

### The Early Fed, 1914–1928: The Morgan Years

- In drafting and lobbying for the Fed, **Morgan was the senior partner**. The Jekyll Island meeting was held at a J.P. Morgan resort facility.
- The Fed had **two loci of power**: the governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the real center of power) and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington (of lesser importance).
- **Benjamin Strong**, governor of the New York Fed from 1914 until his death in 1928, was a **Morgan man** through and through — vice president of Bankers Trust (a Morgan creation), personal friend and neighbor of Henry P. Davison, Dwight Morrow, and Thomas W. Lamont (all Morgan partners). Strong was convinced by Davison that he could run the Fed as a "real central bank . . . run from New York."
- The **Federal Reserve Board in Washington** was also Morgan-dominated: Secretary of the Treasury **William Gibbs McAdoo** (Wilson's son-in-law, surrounded by Morgan associates), Comptroller **John Skelton Williams** (Morgan connection through Hudson and Manhattan Railroad), **Charles S. Hamlin** (wealthy Boston lawyer in the Morgan-affiliated Pruyn family and New York Central Railroad orbit).
- Other original board members: **Paul M. Warburg** (Kuhn, Loeb), **Frederic A. Delano** (Rockefeller — Wabash Railroad, uncle of FDR), **W.P.G. Harding** (Alabama banker with iron manufacturing ties to both camps), **Adolph C. Miller** (academic married into the Morgan-connected Sprague family of Chicago).
- So the original board: three Morgan men (two ex officio), one Kuhn Loeb, one Rockefeller, one independent with ties to both, and one economist with vague Morgan connections — "hardly complete Morgan control of the board!"

### Morgan Dominance in the 1920s Republican Administrations

- **Harding** (1921–23): Closest to the Rockefellers; Secretary of State **Charles Evans Hughes** was a mentor of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and a Rockefeller Foundation trustee. But Harding died suddenly in August 1923.
- **Coolidge** (1923–29): The pinnacle of Morgan political power. Two key mentors:
  - **W. Murray Crane**: Massachusetts Republican chairman, director of three Morgan institutions (New Haven and Hartford Railroad, Guaranty Trust of New York, AT&T)
  - **Dwight Morrow**: Morgan partner who began agitating for Coolidge as early as 1919. Fellow Morgan partner **Thomas Cochran** also lobbied hard.
- **Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon** served all three Republican administrations — a multimillionaire tycoon (Gulf Oil, Koppers, Aluminum Corporation of America) generally allied with the Morgans.
- The **1924 election** was a Morgan dream: the Democratic candidate was **John W. Davis**, senior partner of Davis, Polk and Wardwell, chief attorney for J.P. Morgan and Company, and a protégé of legendary Morgan partner Harry Davison.

> "I have never seen any president who gives me just the feeling of confidence in the country and its institutions, and the working out of our problems, that Mr. Coolidge does." — J.P. "Jack" Morgan Jr.

### The Transition: Strong's Death and the Hoover Era

- **Benjamin Strong** died in October 1928. His handpicked successor, **George L. Harrison**, was a "devoted Morgan loyalist" but lacked Strong's clout.
- The Morgans tried to get Coolidge to run for a third term, then backed Vice President **Charles G. Dawes** (Chicago Morgan railroad connections), and finally settled on **Herbert Clark Hoover** — secretary of commerce but not as intimately connected to Morgan as Coolidge.
- Two unofficial but powerful Morgan advisers consulted Hoover regularly: **Thomas W. Lamont** (three times a week) and **Dwight Morrow**.
- **Hoover's Cabinet**: Secretary of State **Henry L. Stimson** (longtime Morgan lawyer, Elihu Root disciple), Treasury Secretary **Andrew Mellon** (continued), Undersecretary **Ogden L. Mills** (father had led Morgan railroads as New York Central), Navy Secretary **Charles Francis Adams III** (Boston Brahmin, daughter married Jack Morgan).

### Benjamin Strong's Monetary Policy: The Morgan-British Connection

- Strong's monetary policy was essentially **Morgan policy**. The Morgans, through their subsidiary **Morgan, Grenfell** in London, had long been intimately associated with the **British government and the Bank of England**.
- Before WWI: House of Morgan was fiscal agent of the British Treasury and Bank of England.
- During WWI: Morgans became sole purchaser of all goods/supplies for the British and French war effort, monopoly underwriter of British and French bonds. The Morgans played a substantial role in bringing the U.S. into the war; **Strong obligingly doubled the money supply** to finance the war effort.
- After WWI: Strong's policy was guided by the prime objective of helping **Great Britain establish a new gold-exchange standard** — really a phony gold standard that overvalued the pound at prewar par (despite massive wartime inflation and depreciation).
- To prop up this overvalued pound, the U.S. **inflated its own money and credit** to prevent gold from flowing from Britain to America. The result: a massive credit expansion boom in the U.S. that inevitably led to bust.
- **Benjamin Strong was the Morgans' architect of a disastrous policy of inflationary boom that led inevitably to bust.**

### The Hoover Fed: Harrison and Young

- Hoover had been a severe critic of Strong's inflation while secretary of commerce, but favored his own form of easy money: cheap bank credit directed at "productive" uses rather than stock speculation.
- Hoover employed **"moral suasion"** — trying to exhort banks not to lend for stock purchases, believing industrial credit was "legitimate" while stock market credit was "unproductive." This was a **fallacious** distinction.
- **Roy Young**, Hoover's new Fed governor, shared this fallacious view. Partly responsible was the influence of **Montagu Norman**, head of the Bank of England and close friend of the late Benjamin Strong, who persuaded Strong to inflate credit to help England's gold-exchange policy.
- By June 1929, moral suasion had clearly failed. Norman persuaded the Fed to resume inflating reserves through subsidized acceptance purchases.
- Despite these attempts, the **money supply leveled off by end of 1928** and remained constant. The ending of the massive credit expansion boom made a recession inevitable. The economy turned down in **July 1929**, and stock prices crashed on **October 24, 1929**.

### Hoover's Interventionist Response to the Crash

- Hoover was ready. For a decade he had urged the U.S. to break its tradition of **not intervening in cyclical recessions**. During the 1920–21 recession, as secretary of commerce, he had unsuccessfully urged President Harding to intervene massively. In late 1928, Hoover presented the **"Hoover Plan"** for "permanent prosperity" — a pact to "outlaw depression" through massive public works (adopted from inflationists **Foster and Catchings** and their $3 billion plan to "stabilize" business cycles).
- After the October 1929 crash: Hoover immediately intervened to raise wage rates, expand credit, and embark on public works — **the first president to consider himself responsible for economic prosperity**: "therefore, we had to pioneer a new field."

> "President Hoover was the first president in our history to offer federal leadership in mobilizing the economic resources of the people."

- **Andrew Mellon**, the lone voice for laissez-faire, argued for liquidating malinvestments, inflated costs, prices, and wage rates of the inflationary boom. Hoover overrode Mellon with support from Undersecretary **Ogden Mills**.

### The Fed's Response: Inflating After the Crash

- **George L. Harrison** (Morgan man at the New York Fed) was all the more ready to inflate. During the week of the crash, the Fed **doubled its holdings of government securities**, adding $150 million to bank reserves, and discounting $200 million more for member banks. Member banks expanded deposits by **$1.8 billion — a phenomenal monetary expansion of nearly 10% in one week**. Harrison lowered discount rates from 6% to 4.5% in a few weeks.
- Harrison overrode Fed Board Governor **Roy Young**, proclaiming "the Stock Exchange should stay open at all costs."
- By mid-November 1929 the stock break was over and the market began to move upward again, artificially buoyed. But while aggregate reserve factors remained the same, their **distribution** had changed: Fed ownership of government securities had increased by $375 million, offset by lower bank loans from the Fed, greater money in circulation, and gold withdrawals by the public.

> Here we see, at the very beginning of the Hoover era, the spuriousness of the monetarist legend that the Federal Reserve was responsible for the great contraction of money from 1929 to 1933. On the contrary, the Fed and the administration tried their best to inflate, efforts foiled by the good sense, and by the increasing distrust of the banking system, of the American people.

- By end of 1929, Roy Young and other Fed officials favored letting the market "sweat it out" via liquidation, but **Harrison and the New York Fed overruled Washington** and instituted a massive easy-money program. Discount rates fell from 4.5% to 2% by end of 1930. The New York Fed purchased $218 million of government securities. Yet total money supply **remained constant throughout 1930** — increases in bank reserves were offset by bank failures and contraction by surviving banks.

### The Bank for International Settlements (BIS)

- In 1930, **Montagu Norman** pushed through the **Bank for International Settlements** (BIS) in Basle — a central bankers' bank for regular meetings and cooperation.
- Congress forbade the Fed from joining formally, but the New York Fed and Morgan interests worked closely with the BIS, treating it as if it were the U.S. central bank. **Gates W. McGarrah** resigned as chairman of the New York Fed board to become president of the BIS. J.P. Morgan and Company supplied much of the capital.

### The Last Stand of the Liquidationists (Late 1930)

- **H. Parker Willis**, professor of banking at Columbia and tireless critic of Fed inflationism, attacked the easy-money policy in the *New York Journal of Commerce*, pointing out it was actually bringing about bank failures by preventing the banks' "inability to liquidate" their unsound loans and assets. Willis maintained that the depression could only be cured when unsound credit positions were allowed to liquidate.
- **Albert Wiggin** (Chase National Bank), reflecting the views of Chase's chief economist **Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson**, denounced the Hoover policy of propping up wage rates and pursuing cheap money: "Our depression has been prolonged and not alleviated by delay in making necessary readjustments."
- On the other hand, *Business Week* thundered that the "deflationists" were "in the saddle."

### The Advent of Eugene Meyer, Jr.

- In August 1930, Hoover replaced Roy Young as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board with the veteran speculator and government official **Eugene Meyer, Jr.**
- Meyer differed from Strong and Harrison in **not being totally in the Morgan camp**. He was more closely an associate of **Bernard Baruch** and the **Guggenheim family** (copper industry). His major financial base was **Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation**.
- Meyer's background in government interventionism:
  - WWI: Head of nonferrous metals unit under Baruch's War Industries Board; virtual "czar" of the copper industry
  - Managing director of the **War Finance Corporation (WFC)** — ostensibly to finance war industries but really a government subsidy operation for favored businesses, propping up government bond prices and bailing out railroads, utilities, and banks
  - After WWI: Meyer fought Treasury Secretary **David F. Houston** (a rare laissez-faire figure) to keep the WFC alive for financing exports and farm subsidies. Houston resisted bravely but was ultimately overridden when Congress revived the WFC's export lending over Wilson's veto.
  - 1920s: Meyer ran the revived WFC as an agricultural relief agency, financing farm co-ops and price-raising cartels. Took over the **Federal Farm Loan Board (FFLB)** in 1927.
  - His lengthy record in inflationary government lending, plus his service in swinging the New York Republican delegation to Hoover at the 1928 convention, made Meyer eminently qualified to be Hoover's new Fed governor.

### Meyer in the Hoover Administration

- Meyer battled the Morgan-run **New York Fed** (Harrison) for dominance over the Federal Reserve System. The Morgans were even more interested in **bailing out European banking systems** — in late June 1931, the New York Fed participated with the Bank of England, Bank of France, and BIS in a $100 million loan to the German Reichsbank.
- Meyer clashed with the Morgan cabal during the **German crisis of July 1931**: he blocked Hoover from making a blank-check public commitment to the Germans, insisting only the Federal Reserve Board in Washington could legally commit the Fed. Meyer then engineered a **"standstill agreement"** where banks worldwide would hold German short-term debts without trying to liquidate.
- After **Britain's abandonment of the gold standard** in late September 1931, Meyer forced Harrison to raise the New York Fed's discount rate from 1.5% to 3.5%, reversing the gold drain and raising market confidence in the dollar.

### The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)

- By early September 1931, Hoover, Meyer, and the nation's financial establishment agreed America needed a massive infusion of money and credit under federal direction. Meyer wanted a revival of the **War Finance Corporation**; Hoover first tried a voluntary **National Credit Corporation** (NCC) from the banks — it raised only $150 million and collapsed.
- By late November, Hoover agreed to revive the WFC as a new **Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)**. The RFC bill sailed through Congress in January 1932: $500 million from the Treasury plus authority to issue $1.5 billion in securities. It could make loans to banks and financial institutions of all types.
- Hoover made **Eugene Meyer chairman of the RFC** while Meyer simultaneously served as Fed governor — making him "the most powerful single economic and financial force in the federal government."
- The RFC board: four Republicans (Meyer as Fed governor ex officio, Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills, FFLB head Paul Bestor, and former VP Charles G. Dawes) and three Democrats.
- The RFC paid off favored business groups: 60% of its first $1 billion in loans went to banks, 25% to railroads. Much railroad loan money went to **repaying railroad debts to J.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb** — e.g., $5.75 million to Missouri Pacific Railroad to repay Morgan, $8 million to B&O Railroad to repay Kuhn, Loeb. Missouri Pacific was then "gently allowed to go into bankruptcy."
- Free-market writer **John T. Flynn** assessed: RFC loans only prolonged the depression by maintaining the level of debt. "Railroads should not be hampered from going into the inevitable curative process of bankruptcy."

### Meyer's Inflationary Legislation: Glass-Steagall and Open Market Purchases

- In February 1932, Meyer persuaded both Hoover and conservative Senator **Carter Glass** to push through the **Glass-Steagall Act** (the first one, not the 1933 act), which allowed the Fed to use U.S. government securities as collateral for Federal Reserve notes in addition to gold. This enabled the Fed to greatly expand credit.
- The Fed went on an **unprecedented binge** of buying government securities: $1.1 billion from February to end of July 1932, raising its holdings to $1.8 billion. Part of the reason was to help finance the huge $3 billion federal deficit of fiscal year 1932.
- Yet despite the Fed's mightiest efforts to inflate, total bank reserves only rose by $212 million, while **total money supply fell by $3 billion**. Why? Because American citizens lost confidence in the banks and demanded cash (currency in circulation rising $122 million), foreigners demanded gold (gold stock falling $380 million), and the banks themselves began piling up **excess reserves** rather than lending.
- The more Hoover and the Fed tried to inflate, the more the market worried about the dollar, the more gold flowed out, and the more deposits were redeemed for cash — **the inflationary policies proved counterproductive**.
- Hoover blamed the banks and the public rather than his own policies. He organized a **Citizens' Reconstruction Organization** (CRO) and railed against "traitorous hoarding," calling hoarders "unpatriotic." The CRO was headed by Colonel Frank Knox of Chicago.

> "We are engaged in a fight upon a hundred fronts just as positive, just as definite, and requiring just as greatly the moral courage, the organized action, the unity of strength, and the sense of devotion in every community as in war."

### The New Deal: Going Off Gold

- The international monetary system that Morgan helped Britain cobble together in 1925 lay in ruins after Britain abandoned the gold-exchange standard in September 1931.
- By Roosevelt's accession in spring 1933, the **Morgans had thrown in the towel** on the American gold-coin standard — the Morgan-oriented leadership at Treasury (Mills, Ballantine) had been agitating for going off gold considerably earlier.
- But for the first time since the turn of the century, the **Morgans were no longer dominant** over monetary thinking. A new **monetary nationalism** — a desire for domestic inflation untrammeled by international gold responsibilities — was taking hold, backed by:
  - Proto-monetarist and proto-Keynesian economists
  - Farm and agribusiness groups agitating for higher farm prices since the early 1920s
  - Industrialists making retail products (wanting government to pour money into consumption spending)
  - The **silver mining interest** (Mountain-state senators led the silver bloc)
- In January 1933, powerful business groups formed **The Committee for the Nation to Rebuild Prices and Purchasing Power**, dedicated to getting off the gold standard so the government could issue fiat money to "reflate" prices to 1929 levels. Co-defenders: Vincent Bendix (Bendix Aviation), General Robert E. Wood (Sears, Roebuck), Frank A. Vanderlip (former National City Bank president), James H. Rand Jr. (Remington Rand — Rockefeller orbit), Lessing Rosenwald (Sears), and a galaxy of farm leaders.

### The Anti-Morgan Coalition in the New Deal

- The **Rockefeller and Harriman forces**, allied against the Morgans since the turn of the century, now banded together with other rising financial groups to overthrow Morgan's financial and political dominance.
- **Bernard Baruch**: Veteran speculator and political manipulator, czar of the collectivized WWI economy via the War Industries Board. Baruch yearned to re-establish a similar cartelized regime in peacetime, using the depression as the means. A protégé of the Guggenheim family (copper industry).
- **Newer Jewish Wall Street investment banking houses** (Goldman, Sachs; Lehman Brothers) — more anti-Morgan than Kuhn, Loeb — rose to challenge Morgan. The Lehman family contributed New Deal governor of New York **Herbert H. Lehman** to American politics. **Jewish retail interests** (Boston Filene brothers) favored more inflation and consumer spending. **Louis D. Brandeis**, longtime enemy of Morgan corporate interests, was helping run the New Deal from his Supreme Court seat via his protégé **Felix Frankfurter**.
- **W. Averell Harriman**: Scion of the great Harriman railroad interests and longtime Morgan enemy. Dominated the **Business Advisory Council** (BAC) in the Department of Commerce. Also dominant in the BAC was **Sidney J. Weinberg** of Goldman, Sachs. The FDR–Hyde Park–Democrat wing of the Roosevelts had always been close to the Astors and Harrimans (Hudson Valley neighbors), while the Theodore Roosevelt–Oyster Bay–Republican wing had been close to the Morgans.

### Roosevelt's Monetary Appointments

- **Eugene Meyer** resigned as Fed governor in May 1933 — he could not agree to going off gold and inflating the gold price.
- To succeed Meyer, Roosevelt appointed his friend **Eugene R. Black**, young Georgia banker and governor of the Atlanta Fed. Black later spent 16 years climbing the ladder at **Chase National Bank** (which by this time had shifted from the Morgan to the **Rockefeller** camp).
- Roosevelt's first Treasury secretary was **William H. Woodin** — his financial associations were in the **Harriman–Astor–Lehman–Rockefeller ambit** rather than the Morgan network. When Woodin resigned due to illness in December 1933, he was replaced by **Henry Morgenthau, Jr.**, Roosevelt's longtime friend and neighbor, with close links to the **Lehman Brothers** investment banking family.

### Going Off Gold (April 1933)

- Two fateful monetary steps in 1933:
  1. **Going off the gold standard** (April): Confiscated almost all gold from American citizens, placed it under Fed ownership, embargoed gold export, devalued the dollar to **$35 a gold ounce**. This carried out almost completely the program of The Committee for the Nation.
  2. Even the **Morgans** had been convinced by the banking crisis to go off gold — Democratic Morgan partner **Russell Leffingwell** was influential in urging Roosevelt to do so, and **Jack Morgan himself applauded** Roosevelt's decision.
- **Irving Fisher** (Yale professor, intellectual forerunner of Milton Friedman) was the major theoretician of the inflationists. Fisher had believed since the 1920s that since the price level was not rising, there was no inflation and no coming crash. He strongly urged inflationist devaluation and fiat standard upon Roosevelt. When Roosevelt cast the die against gold, Fisher exulted to his wife: "Now I *am* sure — as far as we ever can be sure of anything — that we are going to snap out of this depression fast."
- Fisher had a personal stake: he had invested his wife's and sister-in-law's Hazard family fortune in the stock market boom, and the fortune was ruined — "a mute testimony to the unsoundness of Fisherine monetarism."
- On the other side: bulk of the nation's economists signed a mass petition urging immediate return to gold, led by two hard-money men: **H. Parker Willis** and **Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson** (Chase National Bank). In the executive branch, **Lewis W. Douglas** (Arizona scion of Phelps Dodge copper mining, Roosevelt's budget director) was the major opponent of the new fiat regime.

### The World Economic Conference (June 1933) and "Dollar Nationalism"

- Even though monetary nationalism had triumphed, the **Morgan interests** wanted to re-establish fixed exchange rates with Britain. The ultra-inflationists (Committee for the Nation) were strongly opposed — they wanted continued dollar nationalism, higher gold prices, and continued inflation.
- The **World Economic Conference** met in London in June 1933 with 64 nations. The gold bloc (led by France) urged restoration of the full classical gold standard. Britain wanted fixed exchange rates with a cheaper pound. The U.S. wanted freedom to continue domestic inflation.
- Chief economic adviser to the American delegation was **James P. Warburg** (Kuhn, Loeb — Morgan line). Morgan-oriented **George L. Harrison** and **Professor O.M.W. Sprague** were sent by FDR to negotiate temporary exchange-rate stabilization. They reached an agreement on June 16 with the British and French for dollar-sterling rate at $4.00/pound.
- **Roosevelt angrily rejected** the agreement — the pound must be no cheaper than $4.25, and he could accept no restraint on his freedom to inflate domestic prices. Harrison quit in disgust.
- On **July 1, FDR** stunned the delegates with his famous **"bombshell message"** — an arrogant rejection denouncing currency stabilization as a "specious fallacy" and "old fetishes of so-called international bankers." Roosevelt was now totally committed to the nationalist Fisher–Committee for the Nation program for fiat paper money, currency inflation, and steep "reflation" of prices.
- The chagrined supporters of the aborted London monetary agreement soon left the Roosevelt administration: **Acheson, Warburg, Douglas, Moley**.
- What has not been known until recently was the powerful behind-the-scenes role played by the **Rockefeller empire**: top financier of The Committee for the Nation was **James A. Moffett**, longtime director and high official of **Standard Oil Company of New Jersey** (Rockefeller flagship). Moffett coordinated with **Rene Leon** (New York banker, silver-bloc agitator) and **Sir Henri Deterding** (Royal Dutch Shell — Rothschild interests). Moffett and Leon were most influential in pressuring Roosevelt to torpedo the London conference. **A startlingly clear case of Rockefeller (and Royal Dutch Shell) against Morgan.**

### Banking and Financial Legislation: 1933–1935

#### The Rockefeller Takeover of Chase National Bank

- The crucial event in the Morgan–Rockefeller war occurred within the Morgans' showcase institution: **Chase National Bank**. After the 1929 crash, the Rockefeller-controlled **Equitable Trust Company** merged into Chase in March 1930 (engineered by **Winthrop W. Aldrich**, its new head), making Chase the world's largest bank. Aldrich was the brother-in-law of **John D. Rockefeller, Jr.** and destined to be the key Rockefeller man in banking and politics for decades.
- A titanic three-year struggle ensued. The CEO was Morgan man **Albert H. Wiggin**, with Morgan ally **Charles McCain** as chairman. Rockefeller forces (backed by **Thomas M. Debevoise**, top counsel to Rockefeller Jr.; **Vincent Astor**; **Gordon Auchincloss**) mobilized to make Aldrich president. Morgan partner **Thomas Lamont** fought desperately but unsuccessfully.
- Key behind-the-scenes adviser: **"Colonel" Edward Mandell House**, shadowy dominant adviser to President Wilson. House, once very close to the Morgans, had shifted to the Rockefeller orbit, impelled by his daughter's marriage to **Gordon Auchincloss**.
- At end of 1932, Aldrich ousted Wiggin as chairman of the board. He immediately launched a multipronged attack on the Morgan empire:
  - Collaborated fully with the **Pecora hearings** (U.S. Senate Banking Committee investigation), feeding Pecora data to blacken the Wiggin-McCain regime at Chase and vilify the Morgan empire
  - Pecora badgered and ridiculed J.P. Morgan himself, drove McCain into resigning, and pilloried Morgans for their "preferred list" of politicians receiving advance stock offerings
- By January 1934, Aldrich became chairman of the board of Chase, completing the Rockefeller takeover.

#### The Pecora Hearings: Origins in Hoover's War on Short-Selling

- Ironically, the harassment and persecution of Wall Street originated with **Herbert Hoover**, who as early as 1919 had called for government regulation of the stock market. After the crash, Hoover blamed "short-sellers" and "bear raids" (foolishly believing Democratic speculators like Raskob of DuPont and Baruch were conducting bear raids). He forced Morgan man **Richard Whitney** (NYSE president) to restrict short-selling, and pressured the Senate to investigate.
- When the Senate hearings reopened in January 1933 with **Ferdinand Pecora** as chief counsel, Pecora launched a savage assault on Wall Street and on the Morgan interests in particular. Pecora had been born in Sicily, emigrated as a child, became a Progressive Party district leader, then a Wilson Democratic district attorney. More astute observers noted his searchlight "managed to overlook" pro–New Deal investment banks like **Brown Brothers, Harriman** and **Lehman Brothers**.
- FDR himself met secretly with Pecora and Senate Banking Committee Chairman **Duncan Fletcher** to urge them to go after J.P. Morgan and Company.

#### The Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall) and the Securities Acts

- The hysterical atmosphere of the Pecora hearings allowed the coalition of New Deal reformers and **Winthrop W. Aldrich's Rockefeller forces** to drive through fateful banking and financial legislation during the "First 100 Days" of 1933.
- **Banking Act of 1933** (Glass-Steagall) had three major provisions:
  1. **Compulsory separation of commercial and investment banking** — the main anti-Morgan thrust. Aldrich had been happy to repudiate the Wiggin-Morgan Chase Securities Corporation (doing badly anyway), but his main goal was provision (c): any bank underwriting corporate securities was prohibited from accepting deposits — **a direct death blow to J.P. Morgan and Company**, which was both a private investment bank and a deposit-taking institution. The Rockefeller commercial banks, not tied to investment banking, could happily strike at Morgan's fusion of the two.
  2. **Federal deposit insurance** (FDIC) — cartelized the industry by guaranteeing every bank's success
  3. **Prohibition of interest on demand deposits** — a cartelizing device "forcing" banks to collectively keep payment at zero
- Indeed, **Aldrich actually drafted Section 21** of the Senate bill on Glass's behalf! As Chernow writes: "This was the *coup de grâce* for the House of Morgan." Upon defeat in 1935, J.P. Morgan and Company made the fateful decision to keep its deposit business and divest investment banking, setting up **Morgan, Stanley and Company**.
- The Banking Act of 1933 also began transferring power over open market operations from the Morgan-dominated **New York Fed** to the politically appointed **Federal Reserve Board** in Washington, creating a statutory **Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)**.
- **Securities Act of 1933** and **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: Cartelized the securities industry and the investment banking industry while delivering another body blow to Morgan (who dominated the NYSE through president **Richard Whitney**). The SEC was created with **Joseph P. Kennedy** as first chairman (thrown as a sop to conservatives) and **Ferdinand Pecora** as a commissioner.
- SEC Chairman **James M. Landis** (Frankfurter protégé, succeeded Kennedy) was a conscious creator of governmental cartelization through "industrial self-government" under federal aegis. He shrewdly won over the accounting profession by offering them the power to cartelize and dominate their clients under SEC authority.
- **Public Utility Holding Act of 1935**: Another devastating blow to the Morgan empire, abolishing all utility holding company systems — including J.P. Morgan's directly controlled **United Corporation** and **General Electric's Bond and Share Company**. The Morgans and their allies (led by **John W. Davis** and **Wendell L. Willkie** of Commonwealth and Southern) fought ferociously but lost.

### Marriner S. Eccles and the Banking Act of 1935

- **Marriner Stoddard Eccles**: Young multimillionaire head of a Western banking and construction empire, led by the depression and his reading of **Foster and Catchings** to arrive at proto-Keynesian conclusions: underconsumption as cause of depression, government deficit spending and stimulation of consumption as the cure.
- Eccles's conversion to statism was partly intellectual but also partly self-interested: as head of **Amalgamated Sugar Company**, he led a vigorous effort to cartelize the sugar industry; as a large banker in a shaky environment, he wanted federal guarantees of bank deposits; as head of **Utah Construction** (part of the consortium building **Boulder Dam**), he benefited directly from massive federal public works spending.
- Like the **Bank of America's A.P. Giannini**, Eccles was a Western outsider to the Morgan-dominated Federal Reserve of the 1920s, and he harbored bitter hatred of the Morgan empire. His crusading desire: to transform American banking by **shifting power in the Fed from the Morgan-dominated New York Fed to a non-Morgan politically appointed Federal Reserve Board in Washington**.
- Eccles came to Washington in February 1934 as special assistant on monetary matters to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. With the support of two young aides — former Fed economist **Winfield W. Riefler** and radical New Dealer **Lauchlin Currie** (a Harvard monetarist who converted Eccles to the goal of total political control over the money supply) — Eccles worked out his program.
- In September 1934, Eccles was offered the Fed governorship. He boldly insisted he would only accept if power was fundamentally shifted from the New York Fed to Washington. His memorandum (written with Currie, November 4) demanded the Federal Reserve Board obtain "complete control over the timing, character and volume of open market purchases and sales."
- FDR appointed Eccles in November 1934. The radical **Banking Act of 1935** (embodying the Eccles/Currie program) was submitted simultaneously. Opposition came from an unusual coalition: **Senator Carter Glass** and theoretician **H. Parker Willis** (hard-money qualitativists) allied with the **Morgan empire** (George L. Harrison's New York Fed, which stood to lose its dominating power).
- Eccles won almost all his points. The FOMC was restructured: seven members of the Federal Reserve Board plus five rotating Federal Reserve bank presidents. Open market policy would be initiated, dominated, and enforced by the Board in Washington. Individual Fed banks (i.e. the New York Fed) were prohibited from buying or selling government securities except under FOMC direction. Bank-elected FOMC members were explicitly *not* agents of their banks. Harrison fought unsuccessfully against these provisions.
- The Federal Reserve Board was given veto power over the election of each district Fed bank president. District Fed "governors" were demoted to "presidents," while Washington Board "members" were upgraded to "governors" and the previous "governor" became the august "chairman of the board of governors." The Treasury secretary and comptroller of the currency were removed as ex officio members.
- The last shred of qualitative restraint was removed: bank assets eligible for Fed rediscounting were broadened to include any paper deemed "satisfactory" by the Fed — i.e., anything the Fed wished.
- **H. Parker Willis**, writing the following year, lamented the centralized monetary and banking tyranny the Fed had become:

> "Today the United States thus stands out as a nation of despotically controlled central banking; one in which, as all now admit, moreover, business paper of every kind is gradually taking the form of government paper which is then financed through a governmentally controlled central banking organization."

### Epilogue: Return of the Morgans

- Though permanently dethroned by the New Deal, the Morgans made a comeback by the late 1930s. The great thrust for economic nationalism subsided, and the Morgans began to work again for **stabilization of exchange rates**.
- In fall 1936, the U.S. entered into a **Tripartite Agreement** with Great Britain and France — not exactly fixed exchange rates but maneuvering to support each other's exchanges within any 24-hour period. The agreement expanded to include Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland and lasted until WWII.
- As the U.S. prepared to enter WWII, the Morgans (long closely connected with Britain and France) rose in importance in **foreign policy**, while the Rockefellers (connected with Germany via I.G. Farben patent agreements) fell. Secretary of State **Cordell Hull**'s close friend and roving ambassador **Norman H. Davis** was a longtime Morgan man.
- WWII economic war aims: ending monetary nationalism of the 1930s and replacing it with a new international economic order based on the **dollar** instead of the pound — vigorous U.S. promotion of exports, "open door" for American commerce, and restoration of multilateral exchanges with fixed parities based on the dollar.
- The resolution came with the **Bretton Woods Agreement** (July 1944): a multilateral world of fixed exchange rates based on the dollar, while the Americans accepted the British Keynesian insistence on permanent inflationary policies for "full employment." The U.S. had achieved the objective of moving the world's financial center **from London to the United States Treasury**.
- The dominant role in wartime negotiations leading to Bretton Woods was played not by the State Department but by the **Council on Foreign Relations** (CFR), set up by the Morgans after WWI. CFR president from 1936–1944: **Norman Davis**, longtime Morgan affiliate. Many Morgan-oriented men who had opposed the early New Deal's monetary nationalism now came back to help run the war and postwar: **Lewis W. Douglas**, **Dean Acheson**, **Henry L. Stimson** (secretary of war), **John J. McCloy** (Stimson's deputy).
- After WWII, the Morgans were content to slide into a **new role as junior partner to the Rockefellers**. The new prominence of oil made the Rockefellers the dominant force. The Rockefellers assumed control of the CFR, symbolized by **John J. McCloy** serving as chairman of the CFR, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Chase National Bank. "The old verities and financial group conflicts of the pre–World War II era had disappeared, and had been transformed into a new world."

## Part 4: The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years

### The Classical Gold Standard

- After WWI, all warring nations' currencies were in shambles. They had financed the war by monetizing deficits — most doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their money supplies. Currencies depreciated against gold, masked by exchange controls.
- Germany multiplied its money supply **eightfold** during the war, spiraling into hyperinflation; France and Austria also went into hyperinflation postwar (to a lesser extent).
- Only the **United States**, entering late and inflating less, remained de jure on the prewar gold standard ($20.67/oz). De facto, the U.S. barred gold exports during the war. By March 1919 when forex markets reopened, the dollar was at par while the pound had fallen from $4.86 to ~$3.20–$3.50 — a **30–35% depreciation**.
- For the first time since the Napoleonic Wars, the world lacked an international money. Europe was plunged into "the chaos of an international moneyless, or barter, system."

#### How the Classical Gold Standard Worked

- Under the classical gold standard, every nation's currency was defined as a **unit weight of gold**, redeemable on demand in gold coin.
- The **Hume-Cantillon price-specie flow mechanism** kept inflation in check: if a country (say France) inflated bank notes beyond its gold stock, rising prices made French exports uncompetitive → trade deficit → gold outflow → banking pressure → contraction of money supply → prices fall → balance restored.
- Gold and silver had been the world's moneys for centuries. Paper money experiments (John Law's Mississippi Bubble, South Sea Bubble, Napoleonic Wars) were considered "ephemeral and disastrously inflationary."
- The classical gold standard was not perfect — central banking and fractional reserves still allowed boom-bust cycles — but the **specie-flow mechanism kept these in strict bounds**.

### Britain Faces the Postwar World

- At war's end, Britain led the effort to reconstruct the international gold standard. London had been the prewar financial center; Britain dominated the League of Nations' Economic and Financial Committee.
- **Britain's three self-contradictory commitments**: (1) return to gold; (2) return at the old prewar par of **$4.86** per pound; (3) continue a policy of **inflation and cheap money**.
- The decision to return at $4.86 was **economically disastrous**: the pound was worth only $3.20–$3.50 on markets. Returning at the old par meant British exports were priced **30–35% above** competitive world levels.
- Export industries — coal, cotton textiles, iron and steel, shipbuilding — became **permanently depressed**, generating chronic unemployment of **9–15%** (vs. the prewar norm of ~3%).
- Britain could not deflate wages to match the overvalued pound because **trade unions** and the massive new **unemployment insurance system** had made wages rigid downward.

#### Why Return at $4.86?

- **Nostalgia and pride**: desire to restore London's prewar financial supremacy. The British didn't realize that financial predominance had irreversibly shifted to New York/Washington.
- **City of London creditors**: financiers who held wartime public debt in pounds wanted repayment at the old gold value.
- **The "gold shortage" myth**: the 1920s complaints about a "shortage of liquidity" merely reflected the artificially low price of gold caused by overvalued currencies returning to prewar parities.
- After the Napoleonic Wars, Britain had successfully restored the prewar pound par — but that required only a one-year 17% monetary contraction and 63% price deflation (1815–16). Post-WWI conditions were far more hostile: wage rigidity, unemployment insurance, much larger inflation gap.

> "The announcement made today . . . will rapidly bring the pound to parity with the dollar and will . . . increase the present difficulties of our export trade." — Colonel F.V. Willey, Federation of British Industries, April 1925

### Return to Gold at $4.86: The Cunliffe Committee and After

- **Cunliffe Committee** (January 1918): Committee on Currency and Foreign Exchanges After the War, headed by Lord Cunliffe, retiring Bank of England governor. Its interim (1918) and final (1919) reports called unequivocally for return to gold at the prewar par. **No alternatives were considered.**
- The **Vassar-Smith Committee** (1918) — representatives of industry and commerce — endorsed Cunliffe. A minority of bankers (including incoming BoE Governor **Montagu Norman**) wanted immediate return, but Cambridge economist **Arthur Cecil Pigou** (committee adviser) argued for postponement, hoping U.S. inflation would close the gap.
- **Gold and Silver Export Embargo Act of 1920**: Britain continued fiat paper for five years, with an announced intention to return to gold by end of 1925.
- Both U.S. and Britain experienced postwar booms (1919–20), then sharp deflation (1921). The British deflation did **not** suffice to correct the overvaluation because the U.S. had also deflated.
- **Crucial wage asymmetry**: during the wartime/postwar boom, wages and prices rose together; during the 1920–21 deflation, commodity prices fell sharply but **wages fell much less**, remaining high above prewar levels. This reflected the new rigidity from trade unions and unemployment insurance.
- By 1924, sterling was approaching par — but this was **speculative anticipation** of the return, not a genuine correction of the overvaluation.
- The **Chamberlain-Bradbury Committee** (May 1924), appointed by Chancellor Snowden at the suggestion of Treasury official Sir Otto Niemeyer, was stacked with Cunliffe Committee alumni. Its dominant theme: deflation could be avoided because **American prices would rise** to close the gap.
- **Ralph Hawtrey** (Treasury official, Cambridge inflationist, chief architect of the gold-exchange standard) also favored $4.86, expecting American prices to bear the adjustment.
- The Conservative government under **Winston Churchill** (new Chancellor of the Exchequer) made the final decision on **March 20, 1925**, returning to gold at $4.86.
- The decision was **not made in ignorance** of deflation risks — it was made in the strong and confident expectation of imminent **American inflation**. Sir John Bradbury, Sir Otto Niemeyer, Montagu Norman, Ralph Hawtrey, and the official Treasury memorandum all assured Churchill that U.S. prices would rise to close the gap.
- **Sir Otto Niemeyer** delivered an eloquent anti-Keynesian memorandum to Churchill warning that inflation is "a most vicious form of subsidy" and that "unless you increase the dose continually there comes a time when having destroyed the credit of the country you can inflate no more."

### American Support for the Return to Gold at $4.86: The Morgan Connection

- Why were the British so confident that American prices would rise? Because the **Federal Reserve** — dominated by the **House of Morgan** — would cooperate.
- J.P. Morgan and Company had taken the lead in planning, drafting, and mobilizing the legislation for the Federal Reserve System (1914). The Fed's purpose: **cartelize the banking system**, enable coordinated inflation, and serve as "lender of last resort." The Fed's monopoly on note issue displaced gold as the de facto base of the currency.
- **Benjamin Strong**, governor of the New York Fed from its inception to his death in 1928, was the virtually absolute ruler of the Fed — and a lifelong **Morgan man**. He was a protégé of **Henry P. "Harry" Davison**, one of the most powerful Morgan partners. Davison had taken Strong's children into his home after Strong's wife's suicide, and handpicked Strong for every major role: secretary of Bankers Trust Company, then its president, then NY Fed governor.
- Strong was brought in as J. Pierpont Morgan's **personal auditor** during the 1907 panic. He was "solidly in the Morgan mold" and "turned to the House of Morgan, which benefited incalculably from his patronage."

#### The Strong-Norman Axis

- In February 1916, Strong sailed to England and forged a close collaboration between the **New York Fed** and the **Bank of England**. He bluntly told the Federal Reserve Board he would proceed with or without their approval; the cowed Board endorsed the scheme.
- Strong's most fateful meeting was with the Bank of England's deputy governor **Montagu Collet Norman**, beginning a close friendship and collaboration that dominated international finance until Strong's death in 1928.
- **Norman's background**: Born to banking on both sides — father a banker, uncle a Baring Brothers partner, mother the daughter of a partner at Brown, Shipley and Company. Norman worked at Brown Brothers' New York office, making Wall Street connections, before returning to London. He became BoE governor in 1920.
- Norman was "intensely secretive" and "gave the appearance of being engaged in a perpetual conspiracy." His closest friends were the main directors of Morgan, Grenfell: **Teddy Grenfell** and **Vivian Hugh Smith**.
- Strong and Norman took **long vacations together**, registering under assumed names at Bar Harbor or in southern France. Their close personal and financial correspondence was a dominant feature of the 1920s financial world.

> "The House of Morgan formed an indispensable part of Norman's strategy for reordering European economies. . . . Imperial to the core, he wanted to preserve London as a financial center and the bank as arbiter of the world monetary system."

#### Fed Inflation to Support Britain

- **Benjamin Strong's inflationary program**: To permit Britain to return to gold at $4.86 without deflation, the U.S. was supposed to **inflate** — raising American prices to validate the overvalued pound.
- From November 1921 to June 1922, the Fed tripled its holdings of U.S. government securities, expanding reserves and the money supply. Fed authorities hailed this as helping the recovery from the 1920–21 recession; Norman lauded the easy credit and urged Strong to cut rates further.
- In 1924, the Fed purchased nearly **$500 million** in government securities, driving up the money supply by **8.3%**. Strong explained to Treasury Secretary **Andrew Mellon** that the U.S. had to inflate so "its prices were a bit higher than England's, and its interest rates a bit lower."
- The New York Fed extended a **$200 million** gold credit line to the Bank of England (January 1925), bolstered by a $100 million Morgan credit to the British government — all instigated by Strong and guaranteed by the Fed, warmly approved by Mellon.
- **American interest rates fell to 1.5%** below British rates by autumn 1924, temporarily checking the gold outflow from Britain. Sterling appreciated from $4.34 to $4.78, and by spring 1925 appeared "sufficiently close" to warrant resumption at $4.86.

> "The American people would have to pay the penalties of inflation in order to enable the British to pursue a self-contradictory policy of returning to gold at an overvalued pound, while continuing an inflationary policy, so that they would not have to confront the consequences of their own actions, including the system of massive unemployment insurance."

#### The Morgans at the Pinnacle of Political Power

- Under President **Calvin Coolidge** (1923–29), the Morgans reached their zenith of political influence. Coolidge was a member of a prominent Boston financial family. His two chief political mentors — **W. Murray Crane** (director of three Morgan-dominated institutions) and **Dwight Morrow** (Morgan partner) — were both Morgan men.
- Secretary of State **Elihu Root** (offered the post in 1925) was the "veteran leader of the Morgan bar." His replacement, **Frank B. Kellogg**, was a lesser Morgan figure. Undersecretary **Joseph C. Grew** had family connections (Morgan Jr. had married a Grew).
- Treasury Secretary **Andrew Mellon** — head of the Mellon interests (Gulf Oil, Koppers, ALCOA, Mellon National Bank of Pittsburgh) — was "generally allied to the Morgan interests."
- The 1924 Democratic presidential candidate was **John W. Davis**, senior partner of Davis Polk and Wardwell, chief attorney for J.P. Morgan and Company. "Whoever won the 1924 election, the Morgans couldn't lose."

### The Establishment of the New Gold Standard of the 1920s

#### Bullion, Not Coin

- Britain didn't really return to the **classical gold standard** — it returned to a **bowdlerized and essentially sham version**.
- Under the old gold standard, paper currency was redeemable in **gold coin** on demand. Under the new standard, pounds were redeemable only in **gold bullion** — bars worth many thousands of pounds (minimum 400 ounces = $1,947). Gold could not be redeemed domestically at all; only to pound-holders **outside** Great Britain.
- The purpose: **take control of the money supply away from the public** and place it in the hands of governments and central bankers, allowing them to pyramid monetary inflation upon gold centralized in their vaults.
- **Norman's revealing advice** to the Bank of Norway: "I do not believe that gold in circulation can safely be regarded as a reserve . . . it weakens the command of the Central Bank over the monetary circulation and hence over the purchasing power of the monetary unit."
- Norman and the Bank of England exerted **considerable pressure** to force European nations to return to gold bullion rather than gold coin. During the 1920s, the U.S. was virtually the only country still on the classical gold-coin standard.

#### The Gold-Exchange Standard, Not Gold

- The **major deformation** was not the bullion standard but the **gold-exchange standard**. Only one country (Great Britain) was actually on a gold standard (redeemable in bullion for foreigners). All other European countries held **British pounds sterling** as reserves, not gold.
- A typical European country ("Ruritania") would hold pounds — bills, deposits payable in sterling at London — as its reserves. Anyone redeeming Ruritanian currency would receive pounds, not gold.
- This **cunningly broke** the classical gold standard's limits on inflation for **both** the key currency country and all satellite countries:
  - Under the classical standard, if Britain inflated, pounds flowed abroad → foreigners redeemed in gold → gold drained from Britain → forced contraction.
  - Under the gold-exchange standard, if Britain inflated, other nations kept their accumulating **sterling balances** as reserves and **pyramided their own inflation on top**. Instead of checking British inflation, the system **encouraged all countries to inflate**.
- Britain could thus **"export" inflation** to other nations without losing gold. "In the name of sound money and a check against inflation, a pseudo gold standard was instituted, designed to induce a double-inverted pyramid of inflation, all on top of British pounds."
- For other nations, Britain pressured them to: (a) **overvalue** their own currencies (so British exports wouldn't suffer); (b) adopt central banks collaborating with the BoE; (c) return to a **gold-exchange** standard, keeping sterling balances in London and refraining from redeeming them in gold.
- The **rule of thumb** for return rates: currencies depreciated up to 60% (Britain, Netherlands, Scandinavia) returned at the prewar par; those depreciated 60–90% (Belgium, Italy, Czechoslovakia, France) returned at a rate above their lowest point but still substantially above their depreciated level; only those wiped out by hyperinflation (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany) were allowed a realistic rate.

#### Keynes and the Origins of the Gold-Exchange Standard

- The gold-exchange standard was not created *de novo* by Britain in the 1920s. It originated as an accident in **India** in the late 1870s, where the British imperial center shifted India from silver to holding pound sterling reserves in London.
- **John Maynard Keynes**, then at the India Office, became the gold-exchange standard's first great champion. He dubbed it a "more scientific and economic system" and trumpeted it as "the ideal currency of the future."
- In his first book, *Indian Currency and Finance* (1913), Keynes argued the gold-exchange standard "economized" on gold, allowing greater "elasticity" of money (i.e., the ability to inflate credit). "A preference for a tangible reserve currency is . . . a relic of a time when governments were less trustworthy in these matters than they are now."

#### Ralph Hawtrey: Theoretician of the Gold-Exchange Standard

- **Ralph Hawtrey**, longtime Treasury official and Director of Financial Enquiries, was the major theoretical architect. In a 1919 speech to the British Association, Hawtrey presaged the entire system: international cooperation to stabilize exchange rates **and** world price levels, using an index number of world prices (echoing Irving Fisher's "tabular" gold-exchange standard of 1911).
- Calls for "price-level stabilization" — pursued by Strong at the Fed in the 1920s — were really calls for **price inflation**, to combat the natural secular trend of falling prices in a progressing free-market economy.
- **Hawtrey's revealing admission**: he virtually conceded his ideal was to **abandon gold altogether**. "At the gold centres some gold reserves must be maintained. . . . But if the gold standard becomes worldwide . . . gold will nowhere be needed as a means of remittance, and gold will only be withdrawn from the reserves for use as a raw material of industry." Hawtrey looked forward to **dispensing with gold as a monetary metal** entirely.
- Hawtrey's defense of the system rested on a **phobia of deflation**. He confused the falling prices of the 1873–96 era (caused by the industrial revolution's productivity gains) with "depression" — when in fact production and living standards were rising throughout that period.

#### The Genoa Conference (1922)

- The central instrument for imposing the gold-exchange standard on Europe was the **Genoa Conference** (April 10 – May 19, 1922), called by the League of Nations at the prodding of Montagu Norman via British PM Lloyd George.
- The **Financial Commission** (headed by British Chancellor Sir Robert Horne) produced the key resolutions. The crucial **Committee of Experts** was headed by **Sir Basil Blackett** (Norman's Treasury ally), with **Niemeyer** and **Strakosch** also dominant — all ardent stabilizationists.
- Hawtrey drew up the Treasury plans after "extended discussions" with Norman and presented them to the Committee of Experts. His plan was adopted as **12 currency resolutions** ratified by the plenary conference.
- **Resolution 9**: called for a new gold standard that would "centralize and coordinate the demand for gold" to "avoid those wide fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold which might otherwise result." Translation: fix prices **above** free-market levels and avoid redemption in gold coin.
- **Resolution 11**: reserves could be "approved assets, not necessarily gold" — foreign exchange balances (pounds or dollars) counted as reserves. Countries would buy and sell exchange on other participating countries rather than redeem in gold. "The convention will thus be based on a gold exchange standard."
- Though many historians dismiss Genoa as a "failure" (formal institutions weren't established), the critical point is that **Benjamin Strong** was willing to perform informally all the central bank cooperation Genoa envisioned. Strong's reluctance to formalize stemmed from (a) fear of U.S. isolationist backlash, and (b) his own preference for the full gold standard — but this didn't stop him from collaborating with Norman.
- By 1928, **43 nations** were de jure on the gold standard. Of these, even the few allegedly on gold bullion (France, Netherlands) kept most reserves in **sterling balances in London**. Apart from the U.S., the only gold-coin countries were minor peripheral nations (Mexico, Colombia, Cuba, South Africa).
- **Finland** — acting on the advice of classical liberal economist **Eli Heckscher** — returned at a realistically devalued rate and **avoided chronic depression**, unlike Norway and Denmark which followed the Genoa path of overvaluation.

#### British Financial Imperialism

- Through the League of Nations' Finance Committee, Britain engineered the stabilization of currencies in **Germany, Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Belgium, Poland, and Latvia** on a sterling-exchange standard, with British supervisors installed in new central banks.
- **Emile Moreau**, governor of the Bank of France, saw through the scheme:

> "England having been the first European country to reestablish a stable and secure money has used that advantage to establish a basis for putting Europe under a veritable financial domination. The Financial Committee at Geneva has been the instrument of that policy. The method consists of forcing every country in monetary difficulty to subject itself to the Committee at Geneva, which the British control."

### The Gold-Exchange Standard in Operation: 1926–1929

- By the end of 1925, Norman and the British Establishment seemed triumphant. But the system **immediately began to fail**.
- British export industries remained **chronically depressed**: the overvalued pound + rigid wages + unemployment insurance = permanent high unemployment (**10–15%** throughout the 1920s, vs. prewar ~3%).
- **Comparative export data** (1924 = 100): By 1928–29, world exports rose to 132, Western European exports to 134, U.S. exports to 130 — but British exports reached only **109**. British imports, conversely, rose to 113. After the 1929 crash, British exports **collapsed to 68** (1931) while imports actually rose slightly to 114.

#### The Two Britains

- A sharp divide emerged between old unionized export staples in the **north** (coal, cotton, wool, iron/steel, shipbuilding) and newer, relatively nonunion, lower-wage industries in the **south** (automobiles, chemicals, machinery, electrical goods, public utilities).
- New industries thrived: from 1924 to 1928–29, automobile exports rose **95%**, chemicals 24%, machinery 24%, electrical goods 23%. These were not dependent on exports and paid lower wages.
- Old staple exports collapsed: cotton exports fell 10–20%, woolens 20%, nonferrous metals only +14%, coal fell to 69% of 1924 levels by 1931. Cotton and woolen exports hit their **lowest volume since the 1870s**.
- After 1925, Britain became a **net importer** of iron and steel for the first time in its history.

#### Wage Rigidity: The Core Problem

- **British wages** (1925 = 100) remained stubbornly high: 97 in 1928, 95 in 1929, only 90 by 1931. In contrast, **U.S. wages** fell ~10% and **Swedish wages** fell to 70 by 1931 — enabling Sweden to avoid export depression despite also returning at the prewar par.
- British Treasury official **Frederick W. Leith-Ross** was astonished in 1928 that wages hadn't fallen, writing in bewilderment to Hawtrey. By spring 1929, even Leith-Ross conceded that "organized labor is so attached to the maintenance of the present standard of wages and hours of labor that they would prefer that a million workers should remain in idleness."

#### The Coal Crisis and General Strike (1926)

- The coal miners' union, led by leftist **Aneurin "Nye" Bevan**, challenged the return to gold. Coal wages had been overinflated by the 1924 Labour government, and the industry faced competition from newly modernized French, Belgian, and German mines.
- The **Samuel Commission** (March 1926) urged moderate wage cuts and relocation of miners — a rational solution rejected by the militant unions, who **went on strike**, triggering the traumatic **General Strike of 1926**.
- The strike was broken and coal wages fell slightly — but Keynes convinced press magnate **Lord Beaverbrook** that the miners were victims of a banker conspiracy, and public opinion blamed "hard money" rather than inflationism and the overvalued pound.

#### Britain's Continued Inflationism

- During the General Strike, Britain had to **import** coal instead of exporting it. In the old gold-standard days, this would have triggered severe contraction. Instead, British banks **expanded credit** lavishly, and sterling balances piled up on the continent.
- "Instead of a readjustment of prices and costs in England and a breaking up of the rigidities, England by credit expansion held the fort and continued the rigidities."
- Massive monetary inflation in 1926 caused gold to flow out to the U.S. and sterling balances to accumulate abroad, especially in France. Instead of tightening, the Bank of England **lowered** its bank rate from 5% to **4.5%** in April 1927, losing $11 million in gold in two months.

#### France's Role

- The Establishment myth: France was the "spoiler" who destroyed the gold-exchange standard by undervaluing the franc and draining gold from Britain. **The reality was very different.**
- After WWI hyperinflation, the franc (classically 19.3¢) had plunged to **1.94¢** by late July 1926. Conservative Premier **Raymond Poincaré** was returned to power pledging to save the franc.
- Poincaré's instinct was to return at the **prewar par** — but was wisely talked out of it by Bank of France governor **Emile Moreau** and deputy governor **Charles Rist**, who understood Britain's chronic export depression resulted from returning at an overvalued rate.
- France pegged the franc de facto at **3.92¢** on December 26, 1926, and returned de jure at the same rate on June 25, 1928.
- By pegging the franc, the Bank of France was forced to buy massive quantities of foreign exchange to hold the rate — its foreign exchange holdings rocketed from near zero to **$1 billion** in a year. Most were sterling balances inherited from Britain's 1926 monetary inflation.
- France found itself **involuntarily on the gold-sterling-exchange standard**, despite Moreau and Rist's misgivings. They tried to reduce their sterling balances by demanding gold in London — but **Norman fought ferociously**, threatening to go off gold, invoking France's WWI debts, and pressuring other European central banks to boycott France.
- One Bank of France official said bitterly in 1927: "London is a free gold market, and that means that anybody is free to buy gold in London except the Bank of France."
- **The franc was not undervalued** — after pegging, France's trade deficit returned (exports were only 96.1% of imports in 1928). Sterling balances accumulated in France because of **capital inflows** (French capital returning home after Poincaré's reforms), not an export surplus.

#### The Secret Four-Power Conference (July 1927)

- Norman, losing gold and facing pressure on sterling, played his trump card: **Benjamin Strong**. Norman invited the world's four leading central bankers to a **top-secret conference** in New York in July 1927.
- Attendees: Strong and Norman, plus **Charles Rist** (Bank of France deputy governor) and **Hjalmar Schacht** (Reichsbank governor). Strong ran the American side with an iron hand, excluding Federal Reserve Board Governor **Gates McGarrah** from the meeting.
- **Rist** agreed to help by buying gold from New York (drawing down dollar balances instead of sterling). Strong agreed to supply France with gold at subsidized rates. **Schacht** was even more alarmed at the credit expansion, telling Strong and Norman: "Don't give me a low rate. Give me a true rate . . . and then I shall know how to keep my house in order."
- After Schacht and Rist departed, Strong and Norman planned the next round of coordinated inflation. Strong agreed to embark on a mighty inflationary push — lowering U.S. interest rates and expanding credit. He gaily told Rist he was going to give **"a little *coup de whiskey* to the stock market."**
- Strong also agreed to buy **$60 million** more sterling from England to prop up the pound.

#### The Great Inflation of Late 1927 and the Stock Market Boom

- The Fed launched its **greatest burst of inflation** in the second half of 1927: massive purchases of government securities and bankers' acceptances ($445 million total). Rediscount rates were lowered from 4% to **3.5%**.
- Strong used Kansas City Fed Governor **W.J. Bailey** as a stalking horse to initiate the rate cut (so the NY Fed wouldn't appear to be leading). He told Bailey the purpose was to help farmers — making sure *not* to mention Britain. The **Chicago Tribune** angrily called for Strong's resignation, correctly charging that rates were being lowered "in the interests of Great Britain."
- **Result**: the stock market, already having doubled since 1921 (S&P industrial commons from 44.4 to 103.4; Dow from 95.1 to 195.4), now **went into overdrive**. During 1928–29, the Dow virtually doubled again to **376.2** (August 29, 1929). The S&P industrials hit 195.2, rails 446.0, public utilities 375.1.
- Credit expansion concentrated in **capital assets**: stocks and real estate. A massive real estate boom swept New York City, Florida, and the entire country — excessive mortgage loans from farms to Manhattan office buildings.
- The Fed's "call rate" on stock market loans, which had frequently exceeded 100% before the Fed's existence, was artificially held **below 10%** throughout the historic 1928–29 boom, fueling the speculative frenzy.

#### The Failed Tightening of 1928–29

- The Fed tried feebly to tighten in 1928 by selling $390 million in government securities — but this was **almost entirely offset** by purchasing $330 million in acceptances. Banks simply shifted to the acceptance market when the Fed tightened securities.
- The Fed raised the rediscount rate from 3.5% to 5% in July 1928 but then **stubbornly refused** to raise it further, keeping it there until the end of the boom. Fed discounts to banks rose instead of declining.
- **Coolidge and Mellon** acted as *"capeadores"* of Wall Street, issuing repeated bullish statements. Every time stocks wavered, Mellon called for lower rates and "an abundant supply of easy money." Coolidge proclaimed "permanent prosperity" and that stocks were "cheap at current prices" just days before leaving office in March 1929.
- The **Hoover administration** (from March 1929) used "moral suasion" (jawboning) to try to curb stock speculation without tightening money — a fallacious "qualitativist" approach. Norman was behind the adoption of moral suasion.
- By June 1929, moral suasion was abandoned. In August, the Fed finally raised the rediscount rate to **6%** — but simultaneously lowered its acceptance rate, once again offsetting the tightening. Norman's visit to the Fed in March had once more ensured continued inflationary support for Britain.

> "Once the credit system had become infected with cheap money, it was impossible to cut down particular outlets of this credit without cutting down all credit, because it is impossible to keep different kinds of money separated in water-tight compartments." — A. Wilfred May

#### U.S. Prices Failed to Inflate

- Despite Strong's loose money, **U.S. wholesale prices continued to fall** gradually: from 104.5 (Nov 1925) to 100 (1926) to 95.2 (June 1929). Consumer prices also fell. The massive increase in money and credit was absorbed by the great increase in U.S. goods production.
- Norman could not count on U.S. **price inflation** to bail out the gold-exchange standard. He resorted to dubious tricks — selling gold for sterling timed to coincide with the departure of fast boats from London to New York, trying to keep gold physically in London.

### Depression and the End of the Gold-Sterling-Exchange Standard: 1929–1931

- The 1929 recession **could have been** met like the sharp 1920–21 contraction: accept the liquidation of unsound investments, let money/credit/prices contract, and recover within ~18 months.
- Instead, governments and central banks pursued **"proto-Keynesian" folly**: inflationary cheap money plus massive interventions to prevent price deflation. This converted what would have been a short, sharp recession into "a chronic, permanent, stagnation with an unprecedented high unemployment that only ended with World War II."
- **The Fed inflated, not contracted, after the crash** (despite the monetarist myth). During the crash week of October 1929, the Fed doubled its government securities holdings and discounted **$200 million** for member banks, adding **$300 million** to bank reserves in one week. Harrison told the NYSE: "I am ready to provide all the reserve funds that may be needed."
- In early 1930, the Fed launched a massive cheap-money program: lowering rediscount rates from 4.5% to **2%**, with acceptance rates and call loan rates falling similarly. The Fed bought $218 million in government securities. But the money supply remained stable because of **bank failures**.
- **H. Parker Willis** pointed out that the easy-money policy was actually *causing* bank failures by preventing the liquidation of unsound investments — "frozen and wasteful malinvestments in plants, buildings, and other capital."
- In 1930, Norman achieved part of his dream of formal intercentral bank collaboration: the **Bank for International Settlements** (BIS) was established at Geneva, giving Norman regular monthly meetings of central bankers.
- The BIS was closely tied to Morgan interests: **Gates McGarrah** (former NY Fed board chairman) became its first president; **Jackson E. Reynolds** (NY Fed director) chaired the BIS's first organizing committee. J.P. Morgan supplied much of the capital. Congress forbade the Fed from formally joining, but the NY Fed treated the BIS "as if it were the central bank of the United States."

#### The European Bank Runs of 1931

- **Austria** (October 1929 – June 1931): The Boden-Kredit-Anstalt, headed for liquidation, was instead bailed out by Rothschilds and Morgans and merged into the larger Österreichische-Kredit-Anstalt. But the merged bank was weakened, and in May 1931 a run developed (aggravated by French anger over a proposed German-Austrian customs union). Despite $150 million in international aid (Bank of England, BIS, NY Fed, Rothschild of Vienna), bank runs "once launched, are irresistible." Austria went off gold in June 1931.
- **Germany** (June – July 1931): A fierce run on German banks followed Austria. The BIS arranged a $100 million loan to the Reichsbank (joined by the BoE, Bank of France, NY Fed). The German banking system collapsed by mid-July; Germany went off gold. Fearing the public would identify the cause as inflation (memories of the 1923 hyperinflation), the German government maintained the mark's overvalued par but imposed **severe exchange controls** — resuming inflationary credit expansion behind the controls.

#### Britain Goes Off Gold: September 20, 1931

- With Austria and Germany gone, it was clear **Britain was next**. In mid-July, sterling redemption in gold became severe — the Bank of England lost **$125 million in gold in nine days**.
- The classical gold standard remedy: raise the bank rate sharply to 9–10% to attract gold and foreign capital. But Britain entered the crisis at an absurdly low bank rate of **2.5%** and only grudgingly raised it to **4.5%** by the end of July.
- Instead of tightening, the Bank of England **inflated further**: it purchased nearly $115 million in government securities in the last two weeks of July, making the pound shakier still.
- Foreign central banks tried to help: the Bank of France and NY Fed each loaned $125 million (August 1), followed by another $400 million from a consortium of French and American bankers. But all this aid "was allowed to go down the drain on the altar of inflationism and a 4.5-percent bank rate."
- On **Sunday, September 20, 1931**, Britain went off gold. The gold-exchange standard it had foisted upon the world was dead.

> "September 20, 1931, was the end of an age. . . . Now the whole edifice had crashed. The slogan 'safe as the Bank of England' no longer had any meaning. The Bank of England had gone into default. For the first time in history a great creditor country had devalued its currency, and by so doing had inflicted heavy losses on all those who had trusted it." — Moritz J. Bonn

- **Irony**: After going off gold, the pound fell 30% — to **~$3.40**, the very level that would have been viable had Britain originally returned at a realistic rather than overvalued rate.
- **Twenty-five countries** followed Britain off gold and onto floating, devaluing exchange rates. The era of the gold-exchange standard was over.

#### Britain's Betrayal

- England betrayed not only the countries it had cajoled into the gold-exchange standard, but specifically **the Netherlands Bank** and **the Bank of France**, which it had persuaded to keep huge sterling balances in London.
- On Friday, September 18 — two days before going off gold — Dr. G. Vissering (head of the Netherlands Bank) phoned Norman asking whether to withdraw his massive sterling balances. Norman assured him **without qualification** that England would remain on gold. Two days later, England betrayed its word. The Netherlands Bank suffered severe losses and was "strongly criticized by the Dutch government."
- The Bank of France lost **~$95 million**. Despite its misgivings, it had loyally supported the British system, selling no sterling until after England went off gold. By September 1931, France had amassed **$300 million** in sterling — one-fifth of France's monetary reserves. During 1928–31, the Bank of France's sterling portfolio had at times equaled **two-thirds** of the entire gold reserve of the Bank of England.
- Private French investors and banks (not the government) had correctly sensed sterling's weakness and run on the pound. The British government's projected fiscal deficit of £120 million, union strikes preventing budget cuts, and even a sit-down strike by British naval personnel convinced foreigners that Britain would not defend the pound.

### Epilogue

- The world plunged into monetary chaos: fiat money, competing devaluations, exchange controls, warring monetary and trade blocs, and protectionism — paving the way for WWII.
- The trend toward monetary nationalism accelerated when the **United States**, the last bastion of the gold-coin standard, devalued the dollar and went off gold in **1933** under FDR.

## Part 5: The New Deal and the International Monetary System

*[Originally published in Watershed of Empire: Essays on New Deal Foreign Policy, Leonard P. Liggio and James J. Martin, eds. (Colorado Springs, Colo.: Ralph Myles, 1976).]*

The international monetary policies of the New Deal may be divided into **two decisive and determining actions**, one at the beginning and one at the end:

1. **Dollar Nationalism** (early 1933): The decision to opt for domestic inflation and monetary nationalism — a course that helped steer the entire world onto a similar path for the remainder of the decade.
2. **Dollar Imperialism** (during WWII): The thrust to reconstitute an international monetary order, this time built on the **dollar** as the world's "key" and crucial currency — culminating in Bretton Woods.

### The Background of the 1920s

#### The Classical Pre-WWI Gold Standard

- The prewar monetary order was genuinely **"international"**: world money rested on a genuine economic commodity — gold — whose supply was governed by market supply-and-demand, not government fiat.
- The gold standard was the monetary equivalent of international free trade in commodities — **a method of separating money from the State**.
- It was never "pure": every major country (except the U.S.) had central banks trying to inflate and manipulate currency. But inflation was constrained within narrow limits — if a country inflated, it would lose gold to other nations and be brought to heel.

> As H. Parker Willis described it: "Prior to the World War the distribution of the metallic money of gold standard countries had been directed and regulated by the central banks of the world in accordance with the generally known and recognized principles of international distribution of the precious metals."

#### WWI Shatters the System

- All major countries financed the war through **massive inflation**; every country except the U.S. (and barely Britain) was forced off gold.
- The international order was sundered: numerous separate, competing, warring currencies, exchange controls, fixed exchange rates, and monetary warfare paralleling military conflict.

#### Britain's Postwar Dilemma

- At war's end, Britain faced a core tension: it aimed to re-establish financial preeminence and dominate post-Versailles Europe through the League of Nations, but lacked the resources.
- The pound had fallen from $4.86 to ~$3.50 on money markets (a 30% drop reflecting Britain's greater inflation).
- **Britain refused to devalue** to a realistic $3.50 par — that would admit the dollar, not the pound, was the world financial center. It insisted on returning at the old $4.86 or bust.
- Returning at $4.86 on even a gold-exchange basis meant the pound would be **absurdly overvalued**, crippling exports and causing chronic depression (especially in coal and textiles throughout the 1920s).

#### The Gold-Exchange Standard: A Pyramid Scheme

- Britain devised the **gold-exchange standard** (completed 1925): only the U.S. would remain on a gold-coin standard. Britain would keep reserves in dollars, and smaller European countries would keep reserves in pounds sterling.
- This allowed Britain (and its client states) to **continue inflating** while pyramiding currency and credit on top of the dollar-gold base.
- The system was inherently unstable: if the U.S. — the sole base — inflated too much, the *dollar too* would become shaky, dragging the entire pyramid down. **This is essentially what happened in the Great Depression.**

#### Britain's Methods of Control

- Through the **Financial Committee of the League of Nations** (dominated by Montagu Norman), Britain cajoled or bludgeoned countries into:
  1. Establishing central banks collaborating closely with the Bank of England
  2. Returning to gold on the *gold-exchange* (not gold-coin) standard
  3. Returning at overvalued pars that hobbled their exports vis-à-vis Britain

> Émile Moreau (Bank of France governor) wrote: "England having been the first European country to reestablish a stable and secure money has used that advantage to establish a basis for putting Europe under a veritable financial domination."

#### The Strong-Norman Axis

- **Benjamin Strong** (NY Fed governor, 1914–1928) and **Montagu Norman** had near-absolute control of their respective central banks. Their collaboration was grounded in close **Morgan ties**: Strong was a Morgan man from Bankers Trust; Norman had worked at Brown Brothers (Morgan-affiliated).
- Strong and the NY Fed propped up the gold-exchange standard through direct credit lines to Britain, Belgium, Poland, Italy (1925+) and **massive U.S. credit expansions** in 1924 and 1927 to reverse gold flows and prop up the pound.
- At the secret central bank conference of **July 1927** in New York, Strong agreed to inflationary credit expansion over objections from Germany and France, telling the French representative he was going to give "a little *coup de whiskey* to the stock market."
- The **Chicago business community** protested vigorously. The *Chicago Tribune* called for Strong's resignation, charging that discount rates were being lowered in the interests of Great Britain.

> *The Banker* of London lauded Strong as "one of the best friends England ever had."

- J.P. Morgan and Company played a direct collaborative role with the NY Fed, lending $100 million to facilitate Britain's 1925 return to gold. Dr. Clark concluded that "the New York Reserve Bank in collaboration with a private international banking house [J.P. Morgan and Company] determined the policy to be followed by the Federal Reserve System."

#### "Price Stabilization" as Inflationist Cover

- The major theoretical rationale was "price stabilization" — championed by **Irving Fisher**.
- Under the classical gold standard, prices naturally fell as productivity increased. "Stabilization" in practice meant **raising** prices through inflationary central bank action — replacing the gold standard with "managed money."
- Fisher's **Stable Money League** (1921) and successor **Stable Money Association** enlisted wealthy bankers, businessmen, labor and farm leaders — debunking the myth that bankers always favor "hard money."
- Fisher was personally invested in the stock market and financially dependent on cheap money.

#### The Opposition: Rockefeller-Chase Skeptics

- Led by **Chase National Bank** (Rockefeller-affiliated): chief economist **Dr. Benjamin M. Anderson, Jr.**
- **Dr. H. Parker Willis** — editor of *Journal of Commerce*, former aide to Senator Carter Glass, Columbia professor.
- On the Fed Board: **Dr. Adolph C. Miller**, close friend of Hoover.
- Treasury Secretary **Andrew W. Mellon** enthusiastically backed inflationist policy — foreshadowing the split over FDR's monetary departures.

### The First New Deal: Dollar Nationalism

#### Collapse of the 1920s Framework

- The jerry-built pyramiding of bank credit collapsed nation after nation; failures cascaded up the pyramid to its base: Britain and the U.S.
- **Austria** (1929–1931): Boden-Kredit-Anstalt bailed out by Morgan, Rothschild, NY Fed — but committing more resources to an unsound bank made its ultimate May 1931 failure all the more catastrophic.
- **Germany**: Both countries went off gold with exchange controls rather than permit liquidation.
- **Britain** (September 20, 1931): Wedded to cheap money, kept rates absurdly low (never above 4.5%), and cynically went off the very gold-exchange standard it had forced Europe to adopt. 25 countries followed.

#### Hoover's Last-Ditch Offer and FDR's Bank Collapse

- Hoover offered Britain a return to gold at a realistic par in exchange for war debt reduction. Britain refused, insisting on "reflation" to pre-1929 prices.
- During the interregnum, the nation's banks collapsed. Neither Hoover nor Roosevelt endorsed the laissez-faire route (letting banks fail to produce a hard, stable currency). Both chose "bank holidays" and intervention.

#### The Inflationist Coalition

- **Irving Fisher** reconstituted his forces as the **Committee for the Nation to Rebuild Prices and Purchasing Power** (January 1933) — dropping the pretense of "stabilization" and openly demanding "reflation."
- Composed of prominent businessmen: Vincent Bendix, Robert E. Wood (Sears, Roebuck), Frank A. Vanderlip, James H. Rand Jr. (Remington Rand), Philip K. Wrigley, E.L. Cord, and many more. Membership reached **2,000+** within a year.
- Agricultural economist **George F. Warren** (Cornell) was the inspiration for Roosevelt's program of continually raising the buying price of gold.

> Fisher exulted to his wife: "Now I *am* sure — as far as we ever can be sure of anything — that we are going to snap out of this depression fast. I am now one of the happiest men in the world."

- **Conservative bankers** also endorsed going off gold: James P. Warburg (Kuhn, Loeb), Charles G. Dawes, Frank Altschul (Lazard Frères), and even Russell C. Leffingwell (J.P. Morgan partner), who told Roosevelt it was "vitally necessary."

#### The Opposition to Going Off Gold

- Led by **B.M. Anderson** (Chase National/Rockefeller) and **H. Parker Willis**.
- Key opponents: **Winthrop W. Aldrich** (Rockefeller kinsman, Chase National head) and **Lewis W. Douglas** (Roosevelt's budget director), who fought valiantly within the administration but in vain.

#### The U.S. Goes Off Gold (April 1933)

- By end of April 1933 the U.S. was clearly off gold. The dollar began depreciating relative to gold-standard currencies.
- **Britain was furious**: a depreciating dollar to spur American exports and injure British exports was quite another matter from Britain's own depreciating pound.

### The World Economic Conference (June 1933)

- Three fundamental positions:
  1. **Gold bloc** (France): Immediate return to full international gold standard with fixed exchange rates
  2. **The United States**: Greatest stress on domestic inflation of the price level
  3. **Britain** (+ Dominions): Some combination of the two

- At the conference, the U.S. proposed (sponsored by William C. Bullitt, rejected by France) a coordinated worldwide inflation and simultaneous devaluation of all currencies by a fixed percentage.
- The American delegation was a mixed bag: James P. Warburg worked eagerly on international stabilization at new realistic parities; conservative Professor Oliver M.W. Sprague and George L. Harrison (NY Fed governor) were sent to discuss temporary stabilization. But Roosevelt ignored the petition of 85 congressmen to appoint radical inflationist **Father Charles E. Coughlin** as economic adviser.

#### Roosevelt's "Bombshell" Message (July 3, 1933)

- The first crisis at the conference was over a proposed "currency truce" — a de facto temporary stabilization of franc, dollar, and pound exchange rates. Britain was amenable as long as the pound remained cheap relative to the dollar.
- On June 16, Sprague and Harrison concluded an agreement with the British and French for temporary stabilization at ~$4.00 per pound.
- Roosevelt **rejected** it on June 17, demanding the pound stabilize at no cheaper than $4.25 and refusing any restraint on his freedom to inflate domestically.
- The American delegation issued an official statement on June 22 declaring temporary stabilization impermissible "because the American government feels that its efforts to raise prices are the most important contribution it can make."
- The gold-bloc countries panicked — money began flowing out, Holland and Switzerland lost >10% of gold reserves in June alone. A mild compromise resolution was drafted, merely reaffirming the goal of returning to gold.
- Both Sprague and Warburg urged Roosevelt to accept, as did Raymond Moley, Dean Acheson, and Bernard Baruch. Roosevelt **rejected** it on July 1.
- On **July 3**, Roosevelt sent his famous **"bombshell" message**: an arrogant, contemptuous public cable lambasting temporary currency stabilization as a "specious fallacy" and declaring that "old fetishes of so-called international bankers are being replaced by efforts to plan national currencies."
- The message killed the conference and any hope of restored international monetary order. James P. Warburg promptly resigned; Oliver Sprague and Dean Acheson were soon ousted.

> Roosevelt declared: "old fetishes of so-called international bankers are being replaced by efforts to plan national currencies with the objective of giving to those currencies a continuing purchasing power which . . . a generation hence will have the same purchasing and debt-paying power as the dollar value we hope to attain in the near future."

- **Irony**: Roosevelt may have been prompted to send the bombshell by suspecting a plot by Morgan partner Thomas W. Lamont (working through Moley) to influence him toward stabilization. Yet Morgan's Leffingwell enthusiastically endorsed the message.

#### Monetary Nationalism Prevails (1934–1936)

- From the torpedoing of the London Conference, monetary nationalism prevailed for the rest of the 1930s.
- The U.S. fixed the dollar at **$35 per ounce** in January 1934 — a two-thirds increase in the gold price, amounting to a **40% devaluation** of the dollar from its original moorings.
- The devalued dollar attracted a flood of gold from gold-bloc countries; **France was finally forced off gold in fall 1936**, with Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland following shortly.
- Gold was no longer redeemable in coin or bullion domestically — it served only as a method of international payment between central banks.

#### The Tripartite Agreement (September 1936)

- The only significant act of international collaboration: the U.S., Britain, and France entered a **Tripartite Agreement** (September 25, 1936) partly to assist France in leaving gold.
- France devalued the franc by 25–33%. The three governments agreed *not* to stabilize their currencies, but to iron out day-to-day fluctuations through mutual 24-hour stabilization. Extended to Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland; continued until WWII.
- **One incident marred** the harmony: in fall 1938, while negotiating a trade agreement, Britain began pushing the pound below $4.80. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau insisted on a clause terminating the trade agreement if the pound fell below $4.80.

### Germany's Economic Nationalism and the Road to War

- A fascinating question raised by revisionist historians: **to what extent was the American drive toward war with Germany the result of economic and monetary nationalism?**
- Germany under **Dr. Hjalmar Schacht** went its own way entirely, bypassing gold, the dollar, and Anglo-American financial arrangements through direct **bilateral "barter" agreements**.
- Germany's situation: traumatized by the 1923 hyperinflation, caught with an overvalued mark when other countries devalued, unable to politically devalue again — Germany imposed **severe exchange controls** and resorted to bilateral barter.

#### The Barter System

- In deals with Balkan countries (Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia) and Latin America, Germany exchanged manufactured goods for agricultural products.
- Both currencies were deliberately fixed at overvalued rates vis-à-vis gold and Western currencies — Germany paid above world-market prices for Balkan agricultural products; the Balkans paid higher prices for German manufactures.
- The effect: Balkan consumers subsidized their own peasants and agriculturists, while Germany froze out Britain and the West from Balkan food and raw materials (since Balkan countries lacked pounds or dollars to buy Western goods).
- The barter deals were **mutually agreed upon and mutually beneficial** — not the exploitative arrangements depicted in anti-German propaganda.

#### American Hostility to German Bilateralism

- The U.S. pursued an aggressive "**Open Door**" policy under Secretary of State **Cordell Hull** (son-in-law of Woodrow Wilson) and assistant secretary **Francis B. Sayre**.
- As early as 1935, Hull concluded Germany was "straining every tendon to undermine United States trading relations with Latin America."
- The American Chamber of Commerce in Brazil pressed the State Department to scuttle the Germany-Brazil barter deal; Brazil was induced to cancel its agreement with Germany in exchange for a **$60 million** U.S. loan.
- By late 1938, Germany was being called an **"aggressor"** because of its successful bilateral trade competition. Japan was similarly castigated.
- In 1935, the German ambassador asked what Germany could do to end American hostility. The American reply amounted to **unconditional economic surrender**: abandon bilateral policies, accept the American "Open Door" and most-favored-nation principle — but specifically for *American* exports.

> Secretary of War Henry Stimson drafted: "With German control of the buyers of Europe and her practice of governmental control of all trade, it would be well within her power as well as the pattern she has thus far displayed, to shut off our trade with Europe, with South America and with the Far East."

> Cordell Hull retrospectively: "[W]ar did not break out between the United States and any country with which we had been able to negotiate a trade agreement."

- **Harry Dexter White** (top Treasury aide) testified before the House that a Bretton Woods system "would very definitely have made a considerable contribution to checking the war and possibly might have prevented it."

> *The Times* (London), October 1940: "One of the fundamental causes of this war has been the unrelaxing efforts of Germany since 1918 to secure wide enough foreign markets to straighten her finances . . . Continuous friction was inevitable."

### The Second New Deal: The Dollar Triumphant

- Even before official entry into the war, one of America's principal war aims was to **reconstruct an international monetary order** — replacing the 1930s system of monetary nationalism with the Hullian "Open Door" multilateralism.
- The planned system closely resembled the gold-exchange standard of the 1920s, with **two crucial differences**:
  1. **No internal gold redemption**: The key currency (the dollar) would be redeemable in gold only for foreign central banks — no domestic gold coin or bullion. This freed the key currency to inflate much further than in the 1920s.
  2. **One key currency, not two**: Instead of pound and dollar as joint key currencies, the dollar alone — fixed at $35/oz — would be the *only* key currency. The pound would be subordinate, like all other currencies. This was "dollar imperialism" to parallel America's imperial thrust in the political sphere.

> Henry Morgenthau, Jr. later expressed the aim as "to move the financial center of the world from London to the United States Treasury."

#### The Wartime Coalition

- WWII formed a **new coalition** behind the New Deal, reintegrating conservative "internationalist" financial interests who had opposed the domestic statism and economic nationalism of the early New Deal.
- Key figures returned: **Dr. Leo Pasvolsky** (conservative economist, formerly alienated by the London Conference scuttling) became Secretary Hull's special adviser on postwar planning. **Dean Acheson** returned as assistant secretary for economic affairs.
- When Hull retired in late 1944, he was replaced by **Edward Stettinius** (son of a Morgan partner, former president of Morgan-oriented U.S. Steel). Stettinius chose **William L. Clayton** (former anti-New Deal Liberty League leader, head of world's largest cotton export firm) as key official for postwar international economic planning.

#### Pressuring Britain to Abandon the Sterling Bloc

- Even as the U.S. prepared to save Britain, it simultaneously **bludgeoned** Britain to abandon the sterling bloc (organized after the 1932 Ottawa Agreements).
- At the **Atlantic Conference** (August 1941), Undersecretary Sumner Welles insisted Britain agree to remove discrimination against American exports and abolish autarchy, exchange controls, and Imperial Preference blocs. Churchill tartly refused.

> Roosevelt privately told his son Elliott: "It's something that's not generally known, but British bankers and German bankers have had world trade pretty well sewn up in their pockets for a long time. . . . Well, now, that's not so good for American trade, is it?"

- **Lend-Lease** was the ideal leverage for wringing concessions from the British. Britain consented to sign **Article VII** of the Lend-Lease Agreement (February 1942) — a vague commitment to eliminate discriminatory treatment in international trade — only after intense U.S. pressure. In return, the State Department pledged to pursue "a policy of economic expansion and full employment after the war."
- Britain soon maintained the agreement committed it to virtually nothing. But to Hull, Article VII was "a long step toward the fulfillment, after the war, of the economic principles for which I had been fighting for half a century."

### The White Plan and the Keynes Plan

#### Harry Dexter White's Plan (Early 1942)

- In postwar financial planning, the **Treasury** (not State Department) took the lead. The key figure was economist **Harry Dexter White**.
- White proposed a **Stabilization Fund** totaling $5 billion to lend short-term to deficit countries. In return:
  - Exchange rates of currencies were to be **fixed** relative to the dollar (and hence to gold at $35/oz)
  - Exchange controls were to be abandoned
  - The gold price was set at $35 per ounce
- While the White Plan envisioned substantial inflation, it also required deficit countries to **cease inflating** as a condition for fund loans.

#### The Keynes Plan

- Britain responded with the far more inflationary **Keynes Plan**: an **International Clearing Union (ICU)** with a $26 billion loan fund.
- Keynes introduced the **"bancor"** — a new international monetary unit that could be issued by the ICU in almost unlimited amounts, providing unchecked room for inflation by deficit countries.
- The crucial difference: the White Plan required deficit countries to correct their inflationary policies; the Keynes Plan placed **all the burden of adjustment on creditor (hard-money) countries**, who would be expected to inflate faster to avoid gaining currency from deficit nations.

#### Opposition to Both Plans

- The **White Plan** was attacked by conservative nationalists and inflationists in Britain (Lord Beaverbrook, *Times* of London, *Economist*).
- The **Keynes Plan** was attacked by conservatives in the United States for interfering with market forces and providing automatic credit to deficit countries.
- Critical of the White Plan: **Guaranty Trust Company**, the **American Bankers Association (ABA)**, the *New York Times*, and the *New York Herald Tribune*, which called for return to the classical gold standard.

### Bretton Woods (July 1944)

- After negotiating during 1943–1944, the U.S. and Britain hammered out a compromise adopted at the **Bretton Woods conference** (July 1944, New Hampshire).
- The compromise created the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** with total funds of **$8.8 billion** — far closer to the White Plan than to the Keynes prescriptions.
- The IMF's balance of international control vs. domestic autonomy was **deliberately fuzzy**:
  - National access to the fund was *not* automatic (White's position)
  - But the fund could no longer require corrective domestic economic policies (Keynes's position)
  - Each country could freely make a **10% change** in its exchange rate, and larger changes could address "fundamental disequilibria" — meaning a chronically deficit country could devalue rather than check inflation
  - Deficit countries could impose exchange controls on "scarce currencies" — meaning major European countries with overvalued currencies could enter the IMF and then restrict access to the "scarce," undervalued dollar
- There was **no "bancor"**; the dollar, fixed at $35 per gold ounce, was firmly established as the key currency base.
- The dollar was to be **undervalued** and other major currencies **overvalued** — which greatly spurred American exports (one of the basic aims of the entire operation).

> U.S. Ambassador to Britain John G. Winant reported the perceptive hostility of Bank of England directors: "these men saw 'that if the plan is adopted financial control will leave London and sterling exchange will be replaced by dollar exchange.'"

#### American Opposition to Bretton Woods

- Two major groups attacked the IMF:
  1. **Conservative Eastern bankers**: The ABA attacked the unsound and inflationary policy of giving debtor countries access to international funds. W. Randolph Burgess (ABA president) denounced the provision for debtor rationing of "scarce currencies" as an "abomination." Another bankers' group proposed a **"key currency" plan** — a bilateral pound-dollar stabilization funded by a large American loan to Britain, proposed by John H. Williams (NY Fed vice president), endorsed by Leon Fraser (First National Bank), Winthrop W. Aldrich (Chase National). This would have temporarily preserved the 1930s world order.
  2. **Midwestern isolationists**: Led by **Senator Robert A. Taft** (R-Ohio), who charged that American hard money placed in the fund would be subject to international control and dissipated by debtor countries.
- The administration countered with a **massive propaganda campaign**, driving the agreement through Congress by mid-July 1945. It emphasized (with gross exaggeration) that the U.S. would control the fund, that debtor access would not be automatic, and that exchange rates would be stabilized. **Will Clayton** and Treasury Secretary **Morgenthau** argued that Bretton Woods would eliminate trade discrimination and barriers against American exports.

> Morgenthau promised Detroit industrialists that Bretton Woods would "greatly increase the exports of American automobiles."

- Congress approved in mid-1945; Britain followed at year's end, after "lengthy soul-searching."

#### The Dollar Triumphant

- By the end of 1945, the second New Deal had established the **triumphant dollar** as the base of a new international monetary order. The dollar had displaced the pound; the American empire had replaced the British.

> Lamar Fleming, Jr. (president of Anderson, Clayton and Company) wrote in January 1945: "the British empire and British international influence is a myth already." The U.S. would become "the British protector against the emerging Russian land mass," meaning "the absorption into [the] American empire of the parts of the British Empire which we will be willing to accept."

### Epilogue: The Fate of Bretton Woods

- The Bretton Woods system established the framework for the international monetary system down to the **early 1970s**.
- In the early postwar years, the system worked on its own terms: European currencies were inflated and overvalued, European economies exhausted, the dollar was the strongest and "hardest" currency, and a "dollar shortage" prevailed.
- But by the early 1950s, the balance began to shift. Under the influence of **conservative, hard-money economists** (Ludwig Erhard, Alfred Müller-Armack, Wilhelm Röpke in Germany; Luigi Einaudi in Italy; Jacques Rueff in France), several European countries achieved prosperity with far less inflated currencies. The German mark, Swiss franc, French franc, and Japanese yen became ever **stronger and "harder"** while the dollar became softer and increasingly inflated.
- **Consequences**: (1) The dollar became increasingly overvalued relative to gold; (2) it became increasingly overvalued relative to the hard European currencies. A **chronic and continuing deficit** in the American balance of payments resulted, beginning in the early 1950s and persisting ever since. Foreign short-term claims to American gold exceeded the U.S. gold supply from **1960** onward.

#### The System Cracks

- **Spring 1968**: A severe monetary run on the dollar by Europeans led to two major changes:
  1. The **two-tier gold price system**: The $35/oz fixed price was partially abandoned. Gold was allowed to find its own level in free world markets, with the U.S. no longer defending the $35 price. (Keynesians predicted gold would fall; instead the world market continued to value gold above $35, reflecting the inflated dollar's weakness.)
  2. **Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)** — "paper gold" — were created in 1969 to supplement gold as an international reserve behind currencies. Too limited in quantity to make an appreciable difference.
- By the late 1960s, **General Charles de Gaulle**, under the influence of Jacques Rueff, was apparently preparing to break the dollar standard and move toward restoring the classical gold standard in France and much of Europe. But the French domestic troubles of spring 1968 ended that dream temporarily.

#### The 1971 Crisis and Future Prospects

- In spring 1971, a new monetary crisis led to a **massive revaluation of hard currencies**. The U.S. stubbornly refused to raise the gold price or devalue the dollar, so harder currencies (West Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands) were reluctantly forced to raise their values — a massive calling upon the U.S. to redeem in gold. The U.S. used intense political pressure on creditors to retain their dollar balances and *not* redeem in gold.
- Rothbard's prognosis (writing in the mid-1970s): these are **makeshift stopgaps**, and a series of more aggravated crises will shake the international monetary order until a fundamental change is made. Three possible outcomes:
  1. **The Keynesian dream** (Triffin Plan, Bernstein Plan): Demonetize gold completely, replace it with "paper gold" (bancor) and a new American-dominated world reserve bank — able to inflate all currencies indefinitely. Met determined opposition by hard-money countries.
  2. **The Rueff Plan**: Return to the classical gold standard after a massive increase in the world gold price. Unlikely given powerful American opposition.
  3. **Most likely**: Formation of a **new hard-money European currency bloc** (presaging the euro) strong enough to challenge the dollar economically and politically. If so, the dollar standard will probably fall apart, and we may see a return to currency blocs of the 1930s — but this time with the European bloc on a harder, quasi-gold basis.

> "It is at least possible that the future will see gold and the hard European currencies at last dethrone the triumphant but increasingly uneasy dollar."
