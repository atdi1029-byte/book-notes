**Author:** Murray N. Rothbard
**Published:** 2002, Ludwig von Mises Institute
**Category:** History / Economics
**Pages:** ~500

## Overview

Murray Rothbard provides a comprehensive history of money and banking in America from colonial times through World War II, using the Austrian School's praxeological framework. Unlike mainstream "cliometric" economic historians who focus on statistical analysis of quantitative data, Rothbard traces monetary events back to the specific motives, ideas, and goals of the individuals and interest groups who shaped them. The book is structured as five largely independent essays that together form a sweeping narrative of how America's monetary system evolved from commodity money and free banking toward centralized banking, fiat currency, and international monetary management.

## Core Thesis

The evolution of America's monetary system was not a series of dispassionate technical fixes to market failures, but rather the result of deliberate campaigns by banking and financial elites — particularly Wall Street investment houses (Morgan, Rockefeller interests) — who sought to cartelize the banking industry, expand credit inflation for their own benefit, and use the State apparatus to socialize the risks of their speculative activities. Each major institutional change — the First and Second Banks of the United States, the National Banking System, the Federal Reserve, the abandonment of the gold standard, and the Bretton Woods system — served the economic interests of specific, identifiable groups who lobbied for these changes while cloaking their motives in the rhetoric of "public interest," "sound money," or "monetary reform."
