<!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
<h2 id="takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="summary-section">
<ol>
  <li>The evolution of America's monetary system was driven by <strong>deliberate campaigns of banking elites</strong> (Morgan, Rockefeller, Kuhn Loeb) seeking to cartelize banking and socialize risk &mdash; not by dispassionate experts fixing market failures.</li>
  <li>Every major monetary institution &mdash; First/Second Banks of the U.S., National Banking System, Federal Reserve, Bretton Woods &mdash; served <strong>identifiable economic interests</strong> cloaked in "public interest" rhetoric.</li>
  <li>The Federal Reserve was a <strong>governmentally sanctioned cartel device</strong> enabling the nation's banks to inflate the money supply in coordinated fashion without quick retribution from depositors demanding cash.</li>
  <li>The <strong>classical gold standard</strong> naturally constrains inflation through the specie-flow mechanism; every departure from it has led to boom-bust cycles and currency crises.</li>
  <li><strong>Fractional reserve banking</strong> is inherently inflationary and has relied throughout American history on government suspension of specie payments to survive crises it created.</li>
  <li>The <strong>gold-exchange standard of the 1920s</strong> was a sham &mdash; it allowed Britain and satellite countries to pyramid inflation on top of the dollar while pretending to be on gold.</li>
  <li><strong>Benjamin Strong's</strong> Fed policy of inflating to support Britain's overvalued pound directly caused the 1920s credit boom and the 1929 crash.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Panic of 1819</strong> &mdash; America's first boom-bust cycle &mdash; was caused by the Second Bank's reckless inflation, not by "wild" state banks.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Suffolk Banking System</strong> (1824&ndash;1858) proved private enterprise could provide efficient, disciplined clearinghouse services far superior to any government system.</li>
  <li>Colonial and Revolutionary <strong>paper money experiments</strong> uniformly led to inflation, depreciation, and economic disruption &mdash; giving rise to the Constitution's prohibition on state paper money.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Jacksonian movement</strong> was libertarian, not anti-capitalist agrarian &mdash; favoring hard money, minimal government, and complete separation of government from banking.</li>
  <li>"Free banking" in pre-Civil War America was <strong>never truly free</strong> &mdash; periodic government suspension of specie payments destroyed market discipline and encouraged reckless inflation.</li>
  <li>The <strong>National Banking System</strong> (1863) created an inverted pyramid of credit centered on Wall Street, permanently fusing government debt and bank inflation.</li>
  <li><strong>Progressivism</strong> was not grassroots reform but big-business capture of government for cartelization &mdash; regulatory agencies were lobbied for and staffed by the industries they regulated.</li>
  <li>Britain's postwar return to gold at the <strong>overvalued prewar par of $4.86</strong> in 1925 crippled British exports and caused chronic depression &mdash; requiring American inflation to prop up the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Hoover was the first interventionist president</strong> &mdash; he inflated, propped up wages, expanded credit, and launched public works after the crash. The Fed inflated, not contracted, in 1929&ndash;33.</li>
  <li>The New Deal's <strong>Banking Act of 1935</strong> shifted Fed power from the Morgan-dominated New York Fed to a politically controlled Federal Reserve Board in Washington.</li>
  <li><strong>Bretton Woods</strong> (1944) established "dollar imperialism" &mdash; replacing British financial hegemony with an American-dominated international monetary system based on the dollar at $35/oz gold.</li>
  <li>Germany's bilateral <strong>barter system</strong> of the 1930s was a major irritant driving U.S. hostility, with American officials treating trade competition as economic "aggression."</li>
  <li>Academic economists served as <strong>"court intellectuals"</strong> providing ideological cover for banking elites &mdash; from colonial pamphleteers to the organized economics profession of the Progressive Era.</li>
  <li>The <strong>1839&ndash;43 deflation</strong> was as severe as 1929&ndash;33 in monetary terms, but caused far less real economic damage because 19th-century price and wage flexibility allowed adjustment without crushing production.</li>
  <li>The <strong>gold-exchange standard</strong> was first developed as a tool of monetary imperialism &mdash; imposed on colonial territories (Philippines, Puerto Rico) to tie their economies to the dollar while enriching New York banks.</li>

<!-- THEMATIC BREAKDOWNS -->
<h2 id="themes">Thematic Breakdowns</h2>

<h3>The Recurring Pattern of Monetary Crisis</h3>
<p>Every major monetary episode follows the same cycle: (1) Government or central bank inflates credit; (2) Boom in asset prices and speculation; (3) Inflation becomes unsustainable; (4) Contraction and crisis; (5) Government permits suspension of specie payments, rewarding inflators; (6) The precedent encourages even greater future inflation. This pattern repeats from colonial Massachusetts (1690) through the Continental Congress, War of 1812, Panic of 1819, Panic of 1837, Civil War greenbacks, Panic of 1907, the 1920s boom, and the Great Depression.</p>

<h3>The Morgan vs. Rockefeller Rivalry</h3>
<p>American political-economic history from 1890 to WWII is best understood through the lens of two great financial groupings: the <strong>House of Morgan</strong> (investment banking, railroads, manufacturing) and the <strong>Rockefeller&ndash;Harriman&ndash;Kuhn, Loeb alliance</strong> (oil, commercial banking, railroads). While they clashed for dominance (antitrust actions, Fed appointments, control of Chase National Bank), they cooperated on the essential project: creating a central bank to cartelize the banking system. Presidential administrations alternated between Morgan-oriented (Cleveland, TR, Coolidge, Hoover) and Rockefeller-oriented (McKinley, Harding, FDR).</p>

<h3>The Alliance of Banking and Academia</h3>
<p>From the Indianapolis Monetary Convention (1896) through the National Monetary Commission to the Federal Reserve Act, academic economists served as indispensable partners to banking interests. Economists like Laughlin, Seligman, Jenks, Fisher, Willis, Taussig, and Kemmerer provided "scientific" legitimacy while receiving prestige, funding, and political influence. German-trained professors brought organicist socialist ideas that justified government cartelization. The American Economic Association, Academy of Political Science, and university symposia were systematically used to mold public opinion for central banking.</p>

<h3>Gresham's Law as a Recurring Theme</h3>
<p>Gresham's Law &mdash; "bad money drives out good" when government fixes exchange rates &mdash; operates throughout the narrative: colonial bimetallism driving silver out of circulation, Continental dollars driving out specie, greenbacks driving out fractional silver, the gold-exchange standard allowing inflated currencies to accumulate while gold disappears into vaults. Every government intervention in the money supply triggers Gresham effects.</p>

<h3>The Myth of "Free Banking"</h3>
<p>Pre-Civil War American banking is widely labeled "free banking," but Rothbard insists it was "Decentralization without Freedom." True free banking requires banks to honor their obligations like any other business &mdash; redeem in specie promptly or face liquidation. Instead, governments routinely permitted banks to suspend specie payments during crises (1814, 1819, 1837, 1839, 1857), teaching banks they could inflate without consequence. States actively protected banks from money brokers who tried to enforce redemption. The only genuine free-market banking success was the Suffolk System.</p>

<!-- CONTRARIAN IDEAS -->
<h2 id="contrarian">Contrarian Ideas</h2>
<div class="contrarian">
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Federal Reserve was not created to prevent panics</strong> but to enable coordinated inflation &mdash; a cartel device for the banking industry's most powerful members.</li>
  <li><strong>The Panic of 1837 was NOT caused by Jackson's destruction of the Second Bank.</strong> Recent scholarship (Temin) shows the inflation began before Jackson removed deposits, driven by the still-dominant Second Bank under Biddle. State banks' reserve ratios remained virtually unchanged.</li>
  <li><strong>The Great Depression was prolonged by government intervention, not free markets.</strong> The 1839&ndash;43 deflation was equally severe but caused far less real damage because 19th-century price/wage flexibility allowed adjustment. 1930s government-imposed wage floors and price supports turned deflation into catastrophe.</li>
  <li><strong>"Price stabilization" was actually price inflation.</strong> In a progressing economy, prices naturally fall as productivity rises. Stabilizing the price level requires inflationary credit expansion &mdash; which is exactly what Strong pursued at the Fed in the 1920s, fueling the boom.</li>
  <li><strong>The gold standard's "inelasticity" was its virtue, not its defect.</strong> Bankers complained that gold constrained credit expansion. That was precisely the point &mdash; limiting inflationary bubbles.</li>
  <li><strong>Small banks were not the source of instability</strong>; big-bank inflation orchestrated through the central bank was.</li>
  <li><strong>State banks supported, not opposed, the Second Bank of the United States.</strong> Biddle himself noted "state banks in the main are friendly" &mdash; they valued the cheap credit the central bank provided.</li>
  <li><strong>The Fed did not contract the money supply in 1929&ndash;33.</strong> It tried desperately to inflate &mdash; doubling government securities holdings, lowering rates to 2%. The money supply fell because the public lost confidence in banks and demanded cash, and banks piled up excess reserves rather than lending.</li>
  <li><strong>Britain's return to gold at $4.86 was the cause of the 1920s problems, not a solution.</strong> The overvalued pound crippled exports and required American inflation to prop it up &mdash; inflation that fueled the stock market boom.</li>
  <li><strong>Cliometric/statistical economic history misses the essential role of human motives.</strong> Treating the money supply as an unmotivated protagonist obscures the specific actors, interests, and conspiracies that drove monetary events.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- AUTHOR'S KEY PROPOSALS -->
<h2 id="proposals">Author's Key Proposals</h2>
<div class="proposals">
<ol>
  <li><strong>Return to the classical gold-coin standard</strong> &mdash; not a gold-exchange or gold-bullion standard, but genuine gold coinage redeemable on demand by any citizen.</li>
  <li><strong>Abolish fractional reserve banking</strong> &mdash; require 100% reserves behind all bank notes and demand deposits, ending the inherent instability of the fractional-reserve pyramid.</li>
  <li><strong>Abolish the Federal Reserve</strong> &mdash; the cartel device that enables coordinated inflation and socializes banking losses. Return to a system where each bank stands alone on its own reserves.</li>
  <li><strong>Separate government from banking completely</strong> &mdash; the Jacksonian ideal. Government should keep its own funds in its own vaults (the Independent Treasury model), with no connection to any bank.</li>
  <li><strong>Eliminate legal tender laws</strong> &mdash; allow competing currencies and let the market determine which moneys circulate. If a bank's notes are sound, they'll be accepted; if not, they'll trade at a discount.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply ordinary contract law to banks</strong> &mdash; never again permit suspension of specie payments. A bank that cannot redeem its obligations in specie should face immediate insolvency and liquidation, like any other business.</li>
  <li><strong>Use "cui bono" analysis for economic history</strong> &mdash; when investigating political-economic changes, first look for the hidden economic motive and the identifiable interest groups who benefit.</li>

<!-- DETAILED CHAPTER NOTES -->

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h2 id="intro">Introduction (by Joseph T. Salerno)</h2>

<h3>Rothbard's Method vs. "New Economic History"</h3>
<p>Salerno contrasts Rothbard's Austrian approach with the dominant "cliometric" or "new economic history" method:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cliometrics</strong> (Douglass North, Friedman &amp; Schwartz): Treats history as a laboratory for testing economic theory. Focuses on quantitative data, statistical methods, and measurable variables. The "money supply" is the protagonist; human motives are sidelined.</li>
  <li><strong>Rothbard's approach</strong>: Uses praxeology (the logic of human action) as the foundation. Economic laws are known <em>a priori</em> through deduction, not derived from historical data. History is the realm of unique, complex events driven by individual purposes and ideas.</li>
  <li>Rothbard insists on treating each historical episode as a unique event shaped by specific human actors with identifiable goals &mdash; not as an instance of a repeatable "class" of events amenable to statistical generalization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mises's Method of Historical Research</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Specific understanding"</strong> is the historian's essential tool &mdash; the empathetic technique everyone uses in daily life to grasp others' motives, applied rigorously to historical actors.</li>
  <li><strong>Thymology</strong>: Mises's term for knowledge about human values, desires, and character derived from experience and introspection. It yields "historical facts" (unique, non-repeatable) vs. "scientific facts" (timeless, repeatable).</li>
  <li><strong>The "weighting problem"</strong>: After identifying all relevant causal factors, the historian must assign relative weights &mdash; a task requiring judgment, not statistical measurement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rothbard's Theoretical Guide: "Cui Bono?"</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The State as an oligarchic ruling class</strong>: Throughout history, the State extracts wealth from the productive majority through taxation and monopoly privileges.</li>
  <li><strong>"Court Intellectuals"</strong>: The ruling class requires ideological cover from intellectuals who fabricate justifications for State power in exchange for wealth and prestige.</li>
  <li><strong>The guide</strong>: When investigating political actions, <em>first look for the hidden economic motive</em>. The ideology is "the smoke screen for their loot."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The task of the historian, then, is to penetrate to the essence of the transaction, to strip the ideological garb from the Emperor State and to reveal the economic motive at the heart of the issue."</blockquote>

<h3>Rothbard vs. Friedman &amp; Schwartz</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Friedman &amp; Schwartz</strong>: Positivist approach. The "unmotivated money supply" is the star. They portray the Fed's creation as a "straightforward, disinterested, bipartisan effort" to solve the technical problem of currency "inelasticity." Their 100 pages on 1879&ndash;1914 devote only 11 pages to the political factors behind the Fed's creation.</li>
  <li><strong>Rothbard</strong>: Traces the Fed's creation to a deliberate campaign by Wall Street banking interests (Morgan, Rockefeller axis) beginning in the 1890s &mdash; a full decade before the 1907 panic.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- PART 1 -->
<h2 id="part1">Part 1: A History of Money and Banking Before the Twentieth Century</h2>

<h3>Colonial Money and Bimetallism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Colonial America used British pounds; Britain was officially on a <strong>silver standard</strong> but also coined gold, creating a de facto <strong>bimetallic standard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Bimetallism triggered <strong>Gresham's Law</strong>: government-fixed mint ratios overvalued gold relative to silver's world market price, so full-bodied silver coins disappeared from circulation.</li>
  <li>In the colonies, <strong>commodity money</strong> emerged naturally: beaver fur, wampum, tobacco in Virginia (with warehouse receipts circulating as currency).</li>
  <li>The <strong>Spanish silver dollar</strong> (387 grains of pure silver) was the leading specie coin &mdash; the most stable and least debased coin in the Western world.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Bad money drives out good." But the triumph of "bad" money is the result, <em>not</em> of perverse free-market competition, but of government using the compulsory legal tender power to privilege one money above another.</blockquote>

<h3>Government Paper Money</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Massachusetts invented government fiat paper money in 1690</strong> &mdash; the first in the Western world. To pay soldiers after a failed Quebec expedition, Massachusetts printed &pound;7,000 with a pledge to redeem in gold/silver and issue no more.</li>
  <li>Both pledges were immediately broken. By February 1691 the government printed &pound;40,000 more. Within a year the paper pound had <strong>depreciated 40%</strong> against specie.</li>
  <li>By 1740, every colony except Virginia had issued fiat paper. <strong>Rhode Island</strong> was the most inflationary.</li>
  <li><strong>Maryland's 1733 "helicopter money"</strong>: the public land bank issued &pound;70,000, of which &pound;30,000 was given away in fixed amounts to each inhabitant &mdash; "probably the closest approximation in history of Milton Friedman's 'helicopter' model."</li>
  <li>Parliament prohibited legal tender paper in New England (1751) and all colonies (1764). The return to specie brought <strong>more prosperous trade and stable prices</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Revolutionary War Finance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Continental Congress issued fiat <strong>"Continentals"</strong> beginning June 1775. Pre-war money supply: ~$12 million.</li>
  <li>Congress issued over <strong>$225 million</strong> in five years. Depreciation was catastrophic: $1 Continental = <span class="key-number">168-to-1</span> in gold by spring 1781 &mdash; giving rise to "not worth a Continental."</li>
  <li>States issued another <strong>$210 million</strong> in depreciated dollars. Price controls and compulsory par laws failed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Robert Morris and the Bank of North America</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Robert Morris</strong> created the <strong>Bank of North America</strong> in 1781 &mdash; the first commercial bank and first central bank in U.S. history.</li>
  <li>Morris failed to raise required specie capital and simply appropriated French specie loans to capitalize his own bank &mdash; "an act tantamount to embezzlement."</li>
  <li>Morris's nationalist program &mdash; strong central government, permanent public debt &mdash; was carried forward by his prot&eacute;g&eacute; <strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The First Bank of the United States: 1791&ndash;1811</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hamilton's central bank: privately owned, notes receivable for government taxes (quasi-legal tender), government depository, lender to government.</li>
  <li>The bank immediately inflated: millions in paper pyramided on $2 million in specie. <strong>Wholesale prices rose 72%</strong> from 1791 to 1796.</li>
  <li>Triggered the constitutional debate: Hamilton's <strong>"implied powers"</strong> doctrine won officially in <strong>McCulloch v. Maryland</strong> (1819).</li>
  <li>Recharter was <strong>defeated by one vote</strong> in both House and Senate (1811). The Old Republican hard-money faction voted it down.</li>
  <li>By 1811: 117 state banks with a <strong>pyramid ratio of 4.26-to-1</strong> (reserve ratio 0.23).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The War of 1812 and Its Aftermath</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Banks increased from 117 (1811) to 212 (1815). Total notes and deposits surged <strong>87%</strong> while specie barely doubled.</li>
  <li>In August 1814, the government permitted banks outside New England to <strong>suspend specie payments</strong> for <strong>two and a half years</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>In one of the most flagrant violations of property rights in American history, the banks were permitted to waive their contractual obligations to pay in specie while they themselves could expand their loans and force their own debtors to repay as usual.</blockquote>

<h3>The Second Bank of the United States: 1816&ndash;1833</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Second Bank launched a <strong>spectacular inflation</strong>: by July 1818 it had $2.36M in specie against $21.8M in liabilities &mdash; a <strong>pyramid ratio of 9.24-to-1</strong>.</li>
  <li>Total money supply rose from <strong>$67.3M (1816) to $94.7M (1818)</strong> &mdash; a 40.7% increase in two years.</li>
  <li>Then heroic contraction: total money supply fell from <strong>$103.5M to $74.2M</strong> &mdash; a 28.3% contraction in one year.</li>
  <li>Result: America's <strong>first nationwide boom-bust cycle</strong>. Massive defaults, bankruptcies, collapse of prices.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The Bank was saved, and the people were ruined." &mdash; William Gouge</blockquote>

<h3>The Jacksonian Movement and the Bank War</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Panic of 1819 converted a generation to hard money: Jackson, Benton, Polk, Kendall, Raguet.</li>
  <li>The Jacksonian program: abolish central banking, eliminate fractional reserves, lower tariffs, pay off federal debt (accomplished for the only time in American history), separate government from banking.</li>
  <li><strong>Nicholas Biddle</strong> forced an early showdown; Jackson <strong>vetoed</strong> the recharter in 1832.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Debunking the Orthodox Narrative of the 1830s Boom</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Orthodox historians</strong> blame Jackson. <strong>Recent scholarship (Temin) completely reverses this.</strong></li>
  <li>The inflation began <strong>before</strong> Jackson removed deposits, driven by the Second Bank under the inflationist <strong>Biddle</strong> (27.9% annual expansion vs. 5.9% under conservative predecessor Cheves).</li>
  <li>After 1833, state banks' reserve ratio remained <strong>virtually unchanged at 0.16</strong>. The 1833&ndash;37 inflation was caused by <strong>massive specie inflow</strong> (Mexican silver + reduced Asian exports), not freed state banks.</li>
  <li>State banks <strong>overwhelmingly supported</strong> the Second Bank &mdash; contradicting the myth they were hostile to central banking.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Comparing 1839&ndash;1843 to 1929&ndash;1933</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The percentage deflation was <strong>almost identical</strong> (money supply fell ~34% vs. ~27%; prices fell ~42% vs. ~31%).</li>
  <li>But real-economy effects were vastly different: In <strong>1839&ndash;43</strong>, investment fell only 23%, consumption <em>increased</em> 21%, real GNP <em>increased</em> 16%. In <strong>1929&ndash;33</strong>, investment fell 91%, consumption fell 19%, real GNP fell 30%.</li>
  <li>The difference: <strong>19th-century price and wage flexibility</strong> vs. 1930s government-imposed rigidities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Independent Treasury System</h3>
<p>Under <strong>Martin Van Buren</strong>, the Jacksonians established the <strong>Independent Treasury System</strong> &mdash; the federal government kept funds purely in specie in its own vaults, with no connection to any bank. This achieved <strong>complete separation of government from banking</strong> and lasted until the Civil War.</p>

<h3>The Suffolk Banking System</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Suffolk Bank</strong> of Boston (1818&ndash;1858) was a remarkable free-market institution that brought order to all of New England's banking.</li>
  <li>Country banks maintained specie deposits at Suffolk; in exchange, Suffolk accepted their notes <strong>at par</strong> and functioned as a clearinghouse.</li>
  <li>Results: New England became an island of monetary stability. In the Panic of 1837, <strong>not one Connecticut bank</strong> failed or suspended.</li>
  <li>At its peak, Suffolk redeemed <strong>$400 million/year</strong> at 10&cent; per $1,000 &mdash; vs. the National Banking System's $54 million/year at 90&cent; per $1,000.</li>
  <li>Suffolk proved that <strong>private enterprise could provide efficient, safe clearinghouse services</strong> far better than government.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Civil War</h3>

  <li>The <strong>Legal Tender Act</strong> (February 1862) authorized "United States notes" &mdash; <strong>greenbacks</strong> &mdash; as legal tender. Greenbacks peaked at <strong>$415.1 million</strong> outstanding.</li>
  <li>Secretary Chase waged war on the gold market: stamp taxes, prohibition of gold futures, attempted price controls. All failed or backfired.</li>
  <li>The "gold bill" (June 1864) prohibiting gold futures caused the greenback to plummet from 52&cent; to 40&cent; in gold. The bill was hastily repealed.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Gold does not fluctuate in price . . . because they gamble in it; but they gamble in it because it fluctuates. But the fluctuation is not in the gold; the fluctuation is in the currency." &mdash; Senator Jacob Collamer</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>California</strong> maintained a gold standard throughout the war &mdash; merchants voluntarily refused greenbacks at anything but depreciated market value.</li>
  <li>Total money supply rose from <strong>$745.4M (1860) to $1.773 billion</strong> &mdash; an increase of 137.9%. Wholesale prices rose 110.9%.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The National Banking System</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>National Banking Acts</strong> (1863&ndash;64) created a three-tier system: central reserve city banks (New York), reserve city banks, and country banks.</li>
  <li>This created an <strong>inverted pyramid</strong> of credit: all national banks pyramided on top of New York City banks' reserves.</li>
  <li><strong>Bank notes were tied to government bonds</strong>: each bank could issue notes only up to 90% of government bonds deposited as collateral. Government debt and bank inflation were <strong>permanently fused</strong>.</li>
  <li>A prohibitive <strong>10% tax on state bank notes</strong> (1865) effectively outlawed them, giving national banks a legal monopoly on note issue.</li>
  <li>State banks adapted by expanding <strong>demand deposits</strong> and became the fourth layer of the national pyramid.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part2">Part 2: The Origins of the Federal Reserve</h2>

<h3>The Progressive Movement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The old myth: Progressivism was a grassroots uprising that curbed big-business monopoly. <strong>The reality is the reverse</strong>: big business turned to government to establish cartels that had failed through voluntary means.</li>
  <li>Regulatory commissions (ICC, FTC) were lobbied for and staffed by the very industries they regulated.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Monopoly could be put over <em>in the name of</em> opposition to monopoly! The <em>form</em> of the political economy could be maintained, while the <em>content</em> could be totally reversed.</blockquote>

<h3>The Morgan-Rockefeller Financial Blocs</h3>
<p>By 1900, two clashing financial aggregations dominated:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Morgan group</strong> &mdash; investment banking, railroads, manufacturing mergers</li>
  <li><strong>The Rockefeller forces</strong> &mdash; oil, commercial banking, allied with Kuhn, Loeb and the Harriman interests</li>
</ol>
<p>Both agreed on the need for a central bank. The Morgans favored a gold standard not as genuine hard money but as "camouflage" behind which they could build a controlled inflationary system.</p>

<blockquote>Much of the political history of the United States from the late 19th century until World War II may be interpreted by the closeness of each administration to one of these financial groupings: Cleveland (Morgan), McKinley (Rockefeller), Theodore Roosevelt (Morgan), Taft (Rockefeller), Wilson (Morgan), Harding (Rockefeller), Coolidge (Morgan), Hoover (Morgan), FDR (Harriman&ndash;Kuhn, Loeb&ndash;Rockefeller).</blockquote>

<h3>The Indianapolis Monetary Convention (1897)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After the 1896 election, the Morgan-Rockefeller forces organized a "grassroots" Midwestern reform movement. The executive committee was packed with Morgan and Rockefeller associates.</li>
  <li>The key working member: <strong>James Laurence Laughlin</strong> (University of Chicago), who supervised all operations. His assistants: <strong>L. Carroll Root</strong> and <strong>Henry Parker Willis</strong> (who would later draft the Federal Reserve Act).</li>
  <li><strong>$50,000</strong> was raised from banking/corporate interests. The commission developed methods of molding public opinion: hired journalist Charles A. Conant, built a distribution network reaching 100,000 correspondents and 7,500 newspapers.</li>
  <li>The commission's final report explicitly called for a <strong>central bank</strong> with a monopoly of note issue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charles A. Conant and Monetary Imperialism</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>gold-exchange standard</strong> replaced genuine gold with a dollar standard: silver countries held reserves in <strong>dollars deposited at New York banks</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Puerto Rico</strong>: the U.S. substituted its own debased silver dollar for the Spanish one.</li>
  <li><strong>Philippines</strong>: Conant replaced the full-bodied Mexican dollar with a debased American silver coin. Filipinos called the new coins <strong>"conants."</strong></li>
  <li><strong>China</strong>: The big failure. Chinese officials saw through the scheme, denouncing it as "irresponsible and immoral debasement."</li>
  <li><strong>Edwin W. Kemmerer</strong> continued Conant's work in the 1920s, imposing central banks on Third World countries while collecting retainers from investment bank Dillon, Read.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Panic of 1907 and Mobilization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The October 1907 crisis consolidated opinion behind a central bank. The alliance between <strong>academia and the power elite</strong> proved critical.</li>
  <li><strong>Seligman</strong> declared the system's problem was <strong>decentralization</strong>: "the struggle which has been victoriously fought everywhere else [in creating trusts] must be undertaken here."</li>
  <li><strong>Vanderlip</strong> called the panic "one of the great calamities of history" and declared that "the alien external power of the free and competitive market must be replaced by central control."</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Jekyll Island Meeting (November 1910)</h3>
<p>On <strong>November 22, 1910</strong>, Senator Aldrich and companions traveled in a private railroad car to the exclusive <strong>Jekyll Island Club</strong> &mdash; facilities arranged by J.P. Morgan. The cover story: a "duck-hunting expedition."</p>
<p>The <strong>six conferees</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Nelson W. Aldrich</strong> (Rockefeller)</li>
  <li><strong>Henry P. Davison</strong> (Morgan partner)</li>
  <li><strong>Paul Warburg</strong> (Kuhn, Loeb)</li>
  <li><strong>Frank A. Vanderlip</strong> (National City Bank &mdash; Rockefeller)</li>
  <li><strong>A. Piatt Andrew</strong> (Harvard economist)</li>
  <li><strong>Charles D. Norton</strong> (Morgan &mdash; First National Bank of New York)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only disagreement: Aldrich wanted a straightforward central bank; <strong>Warburg insisted on cloaking central control</strong> in "decentralization" &mdash; regional reserve banks appearing independent but centrally coordinated. Warburg won.</p>

<h3>The Federal Reserve Act (December 1913)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The reformers dropped the "Aldrich" name, made minor adjustments, and rebaptized the bill as a Democratic measure via <strong>H. Parker Willis</strong> and <strong>Carter Glass</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>A. Barton Hepburn</strong> (Chase National Bank) told the ABA: "The measure recognizes and adopts the principles of a central bank . . . it will make all incorporated banks together joint owners of a central dominating power."</li>
  <li>Control was promptly handed to Morgan men, led by <strong>Benjamin Strong</strong> of Bankers Trust as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The real purpose . . . was to discuss winning the banking community over to government control directly by the bankers for their own ends. . . . It was generally appreciated that the plan would increase the power of the big national banks to compete with the rapidly growing state banks." &mdash; Gabriel Kolko</blockquote>

<!-- PART 3 -->
<h2 id="part3">Part 3: From Hoover to Roosevelt &mdash; The Federal Reserve and the Financial Elites</h2>

<h3>The Early Fed: The Morgan Years (1914&ndash;1928)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Benjamin Strong</strong>, NY Fed governor 1914&ndash;1928, was a Morgan man through and through &mdash; protégé of Henry P. Davison, personal neighbor of Morgan partners.</li>
  <li>The Federal Reserve Board in Washington was also Morgan-dominated: McAdoo, Williams, Hamlin. <strong>Paul Warburg</strong> (Kuhn, Loeb) and <strong>Frederic Delano</strong> (Rockefeller, uncle of FDR) were also members.</li>
  <li>Strong's policy: helping <strong>Britain establish a new gold-exchange standard</strong> with an overvalued pound. To prop up the pound, the U.S. inflated its own money and credit &mdash; creating the boom that led to bust.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Transition: Strong's Death and the Hoover Era</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Under <strong>Coolidge</strong>, the Morgans reached their zenith of political influence.</li>
  <li><strong>Hoover</strong> employed "moral suasion" &mdash; trying to curb stock speculation without tightening money. A <strong>fallacious</strong> distinction between "productive" and "unproductive" credit.</li>
  <li>The economy turned down in <strong>July 1929</strong>; stocks crashed on <strong>October 24, 1929</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hoover's Interventionist Response</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hoover was <strong>the first president to consider himself responsible for economic prosperity</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Andrew Mellon</strong>, the lone voice for laissez-faire, argued for liquidating malinvestments. Hoover overrode Mellon.</li>
  <li>During the crash week, the Fed <strong>doubled government securities holdings</strong>, adding $150M to reserves and discounting $200M more. Member banks expanded deposits by <strong>$1.8 billion in one week</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Here we see, at the very beginning of the Hoover era, the spuriousness of the monetarist legend that the Federal Reserve was responsible for the great contraction. On the contrary, the Fed and the administration tried their best to inflate, efforts foiled by the good sense, and by the increasing distrust of the banking system, of the American people.</blockquote>

<h3>Eugene Meyer and the RFC</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eugene Meyer, Jr.</strong> became Fed chairman in August 1930 &mdash; not a Morgan man but an associate of Baruch and the Guggenheims.</li>
  <li>Meyer drove through the <strong>Reconstruction Finance Corporation</strong> (January 1932): $500M from Treasury plus $1.5 billion in securities authority. 60% of first $1 billion went to banks, 25% to railroads &mdash; much to repay debts to J.P. Morgan and Kuhn, Loeb.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Glass-Steagall Act</strong> (1932, first version) allowed the Fed to use government securities as collateral for notes. The Fed bought <strong>$1.1 billion</strong> in government securities. Yet total money supply <strong>fell by $3 billion</strong> as the public demanded cash and foreigners demanded gold.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"We are engaged in a fight upon a hundred fronts just as positive, just as definite, and requiring just as greatly the moral courage . . . as in war." &mdash; Hoover</blockquote>

<h3>The Anti-Morgan Coalition in the New Deal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Rockefeller and Harriman forces</strong>, allied against the Morgans, banded together with newer Jewish Wall Street houses (Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers), <strong>Bernard Baruch</strong>, and Western outsiders.</li>
  <li>The crucial event: the <strong>Rockefeller takeover of Chase National Bank</strong>. <strong>Winthrop W. Aldrich</strong> (Rockefeller Jr.'s brother-in-law) ousted Morgan men Wiggin and McCain by end of 1932, collaborated with the <strong>Pecora hearings</strong> to blacken the Morgan empire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Going Off Gold (April 1933)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Roosevelt confiscated gold from citizens, embargoed exports, devalued to <strong>$35/oz</strong>.</li>
  <li>Even the Morgans had been convinced to go off gold &mdash; Russell Leffingwell urged Roosevelt, and Jack Morgan applauded.</li>
  <li><strong>Irving Fisher</strong> exulted: "Now I <em>am</em> sure we are going to snap out of this depression fast." Fisher had personally lost his wife's fortune in the stock market &mdash; "a mute testimony to the unsoundness of Fisherine monetarism."</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall) and Securities Acts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Compulsory separation of commercial and investment banking</strong> &mdash; the main anti-Morgan thrust. <strong>Aldrich actually drafted Section 21</strong> of the bill on Glass's behalf. This was "the <em>coup de gr&acirc;ce</em> for the House of Morgan."</li>
  <li>J.P. Morgan chose to keep deposits and divest investment banking, setting up <strong>Morgan, Stanley and Company</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Act began transferring open market power from the Morgan-dominated NY Fed to the politically appointed Federal Reserve Board in Washington.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Marriner Eccles and the Banking Act of 1935</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Marriner Eccles</strong>: Western banking tycoon turned proto-Keynesian. His crusading desire: shift Fed power from the Morgan-dominated NY Fed to Washington.</li>
  <li>With aide <strong>Lauchlin Currie</strong>, Eccles demanded "complete control over the timing, character and volume of open market purchases and sales."</li>
  <li>The FOMC was restructured: seven Board members plus five rotating bank presidents. Open market policy dominated by Washington. Individual Fed banks prohibited from independent action. The NY Fed was effectively <strong>dethroned</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Today the United States stands out as a nation of despotically controlled central banking; one in which business paper of every kind is gradually taking the form of government paper." &mdash; H. Parker Willis</blockquote>

<h3>Epilogue: Return of the Morgans</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Morgans made a comeback by the late 1930s, working for <strong>stabilization of exchange rates</strong> (Tripartite Agreement, 1936).</li>
  <li>WWII brought the Morgans back in foreign policy (closely connected with Britain/France). The resolution: <strong>Bretton Woods</strong> (1944).</li>
  <li>After WWII, the Morgans settled into a <strong>new role as junior partner to the Rockefellers</strong>. The old financial group conflicts had "disappeared, and had been transformed into a new world."</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- PART 4 -->
<h2 id="part4">Part 4: The Gold-Exchange Standard in the Interwar Years</h2>

<h3>The Classical Gold Standard</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After WWI, all warring nations' currencies were in shambles. Germany multiplied its money supply <strong>eightfold</strong>.</li>
  <li>Only the U.S. remained de jure on the prewar gold standard ($20.67/oz). By March 1919, the dollar was at par while the pound had fallen <strong>30&ndash;35%</strong>.</li>
  <li>Under the classical gold standard, the <strong>Hume-Cantillon specie-flow mechanism</strong> kept inflation in check.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Britain's Return to Gold at $4.86</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Britain's three <strong>self-contradictory commitments</strong>: return to gold, return at the prewar par of $4.86, and continue inflation and cheap money.</li>
  <li>The pound was worth only $3.20&ndash;$3.50. Returning at $4.86 priced British exports <strong>30&ndash;35% above</strong> competitive levels.</li>
  <li>Export industries became permanently depressed; unemployment ran <strong>9&ndash;15%</strong> (vs. prewar ~3%).</li>
  <li>The decision was made in the confident expectation of <strong>American inflation</strong> &mdash; and the Morgan-dominated Fed obliged.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The announcement made today will rapidly bring the pound to parity with the dollar and will increase the present difficulties of our export trade." &mdash; Colonel F.V. Willey, Federation of British Industries, April 1925</blockquote>

<h3>The Gold-Exchange Standard: Not Gold</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only Britain was on a gold standard (bullion for foreigners only). All other European countries held <strong>British pounds sterling</strong> as reserves.</li>
  <li>Under the classical standard, inflation triggered gold drains and forced contraction. Under the gold-exchange standard, foreign nations <strong>kept their accumulating sterling balances as reserves and pyramided their own inflation on top</strong>.</li>
  <li>Britain could "export" inflation without losing gold. "In the name of sound money, a pseudo gold standard was instituted, designed to induce a double-inverted pyramid of inflation."</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Strong-Norman Axis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Benjamin Strong</strong> and <strong>Montagu Norman</strong> forged a close collaboration from 1916. They took long vacations together, registering under assumed names.</li>
  <li>In 1924, the Fed purchased <strong>$500 million</strong> in government securities, driving up the money supply 8.3%. Strong told Mellon: the U.S. had to inflate so "its prices were a bit higher than England's."</li>
  <li>The NY Fed extended a <strong>$200 million</strong> gold credit line to the Bank of England, bolstered by a $100 million Morgan credit.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The American people would have to pay the penalties of inflation in order to enable the British to pursue a self-contradictory policy of returning to gold at an overvalued pound."</blockquote>

<h3>France's Role</h3>
<ul>
  <li>France pegged the franc at <strong>3.92&cent;</strong> (vs. the prewar 19.3&cent;) &mdash; a realistic rate that avoided chronic depression.</li>
  <li>The Bank of France accumulated <strong>$1 billion</strong> in sterling balances. When it tried to redeem in gold, <strong>Norman fought ferociously</strong>, threatening to go off gold.</li>
  <li>One official said bitterly: "London is a free gold market &mdash; anybody is free to buy gold in London except the Bank of France."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"England . . . has used that advantage to establish a basis for putting Europe under a veritable financial domination. The Financial Committee at Geneva has been the instrument of that policy." &mdash; Emile Moreau, Bank of France</blockquote>

<h3>The Secret Four-Power Conference (July 1927)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Norman invited Strong, Rist (Bank of France), and Schacht (Reichsbank) to a <strong>top-secret conference</strong> in New York.</li>
  <li><strong>Schacht</strong> warned: "Don't give me a low rate. Give me a true rate and then I shall know how to keep my house in order."</li>
  <li>Strong agreed to a mighty inflationary push, telling Rist he was going to give <strong>"a little <em>coup de whiskey</em> to the stock market."</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Great Inflation and Stock Market Boom</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Fed launched its <strong>greatest burst of inflation</strong> in late 1927: $445 million in purchases, rates cut to 3.5%.</li>
  <li>The stock market went into overdrive: the Dow virtually <strong>doubled</strong> during 1928&ndash;29, reaching <span class="key-number">376.2</span> on August 29, 1929.</li>
  <li>Despite massive credit expansion, <strong>U.S. wholesale prices continued to fall</strong> &mdash; the enormous increase in money was absorbed by rising production. Norman could not count on price inflation to bail out the gold-exchange standard.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Once the credit system had become infected with cheap money, it was impossible to cut down particular outlets without cutting down all credit." &mdash; A. Wilfred May</blockquote>

<h3>Depression and the End of the Gold-Exchange Standard</h3>

<h4>The European Bank Runs of 1931</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Austria</strong> (May 1931): The Kredit-Anstalt collapsed despite $150M in international aid. Austria went off gold.</li>
  <li><strong>Germany</strong> (July 1931): The banking system collapsed; Germany went off gold with severe exchange controls.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Britain Goes Off Gold: September 20, 1931</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Bank of England lost <strong>$125 million in gold in nine days</strong>. Instead of tightening, it <strong>inflated further</strong>.</li>
  <li>Foreign central banks loaned $650 million in aid &mdash; all "allowed to go down the drain on the altar of inflationism."</li>
  <li>On September 18, <strong>two days before</strong> going off gold, Norman assured the Netherlands Bank without qualification that England would remain on gold. Two days later, England betrayed its word.</li>
  <li>The Bank of France lost <strong>~$95 million</strong>; its sterling portfolio had at times equaled two-thirds of England's entire gold reserve.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"September 20, 1931, was the end of an age. . . . The slogan 'safe as the Bank of England' no longer had any meaning." &mdash; Moritz J. Bonn</blockquote>

<p>After going off gold, the pound fell 30% to <strong>~$3.40</strong> &mdash; the very level that would have been viable had Britain originally returned at a realistic rate. <strong>Twenty-five countries</strong> followed Britain off gold.</p>

<hr>

<!-- PART 5 -->
<h2 id="part5">Part 5: The New Deal and the International Monetary System</h2>

<p>The international monetary policies of the New Deal divide into <strong>two decisive actions</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Dollar Nationalism</strong> (early 1933): Domestic inflation and monetary nationalism, steering the world onto a similar path for the decade.</li>
  <li><strong>Dollar Imperialism</strong> (during WWII): Reconstituting an international monetary order built on the dollar &mdash; culminating in Bretton Woods.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Inflationist Coalition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Committee for the Nation to Rebuild Prices and Purchasing Power</strong> (January 1933) demanded "reflation" &mdash; dropping the pretense of "stabilization."</li>
  <li>Members included Vincent Bendix, General Robert E. Wood (Sears), Frank Vanderlip, James H. Rand Jr. &mdash; membership reached <strong>2,000+</strong> within a year.</li>
  <li><strong>Irving Fisher</strong> was the major theoretician; <strong>George F. Warren</strong> (Cornell) inspired FDR's gold-price program.</li>
  <li>The top financier of the Committee was <strong>James A. Moffett</strong>, longtime director of Standard Oil of New Jersey (Rockefeller flagship).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The World Economic Conference (June 1933)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Three positions: (1) France &mdash; return to full gold standard; (2) U.S. &mdash; domestic inflation; (3) Britain &mdash; compromise.</li>
  <li>Harrison and Sprague negotiated temporary stabilization at ~$4.00/pound. <strong>Roosevelt rejected it</strong>, demanding $4.25 and freedom to inflate.</li>
  <li>On <strong>July 3</strong>, Roosevelt sent his famous <strong>"bombshell message"</strong>: an arrogant rejection denouncing stabilization as a "specious fallacy" and "old fetishes of so-called international bankers."</li>
  <li>Behind the scenes: <strong>Moffett</strong> (Standard Oil/Rockefeller) and <strong>Rene Leon</strong> pressured Roosevelt to torpedo the conference &mdash; "a startlingly clear case of Rockefeller against Morgan."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Roosevelt declared: "Old fetishes of so-called international bankers are being replaced by efforts to plan national currencies."</blockquote>

<h3>Germany's Barter System and the Road to War</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Germany under <strong>Schacht</strong> imposed bilateral barter agreements with Balkan countries and Latin America, bypassing the dollar entirely.</li>
  <li>The deals were <strong>mutually agreed upon and mutually beneficial</strong> &mdash; not the exploitative arrangements depicted in propaganda.</li>
  <li>American hostility: Hull concluded Germany was "straining every tendon to undermine United States trading relations with Latin America." The American reply to German inquiries amounted to <strong>unconditional economic surrender</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Harry Dexter White</strong> testified that a Bretton Woods system "would very definitely have made a considerable contribution to checking the war."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Secretary of War Stimson: "With German control of the buyers of Europe . . . it would be well within her power to shut off our trade with Europe, South America and the Far East."</blockquote>

<h3>The White Plan and the Keynes Plan</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>White Plan</strong>: A $5 billion Stabilization Fund with fixed exchange rates relative to the dollar at $35/oz. Deficit countries must cease inflating as a condition for loans.</li>
  <li><strong>Keynes Plan</strong>: A $26 billion International Clearing Union with the "bancor" &mdash; placing all burden of adjustment on creditor (hard-money) countries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bretton Woods (July 1944)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The compromise created the <strong>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</strong> with <strong>$8.8 billion</strong> &mdash; far closer to the White Plan.</li>
  <li>No "bancor"; the dollar at $35/gold ounce was the key currency base. The dollar was <strong>undervalued</strong> and other currencies overvalued &mdash; spurring American exports.</li>
  <li>The administration drove the agreement through Congress with a <strong>massive propaganda campaign</strong>, promising it would "greatly increase the exports of American automobiles."</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>U.S. Ambassador Winant reported Bank of England directors saw "that if the plan is adopted financial control will leave London and sterling exchange will be replaced by dollar exchange."</blockquote>

<h3>Epilogue: The Fate of Bretton Woods</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By the early 1950s, European hard-money economists (Erhard, R&ouml;pke, Einaudi, Rueff) achieved prosperity with less inflated currencies. The dollar became increasingly overvalued.</li>
  <li>Foreign claims to American gold exceeded the U.S. gold supply from <strong>1960</strong> onward. A chronic balance-of-payments deficit persisted.</li>
  <li><strong>Spring 1968</strong>: The two-tier gold price system partially abandoned the $35/oz fix. Special Drawing Rights ("paper gold") were created in 1969.</li>
  <li>In spring 1971, a new crisis forced massive revaluation of hard currencies. The U.S. stubbornly refused to devalue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rothbard's prognosis (mid-1970s): three possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>The Keynesian dream</strong>: Demonetize gold, replace with "paper gold" and a world reserve bank &mdash; able to inflate all currencies indefinitely.</li>
  <li><strong>The Rueff Plan</strong>: Return to the classical gold standard at a much higher gold price.</li>
  <li><strong>Most likely</strong>: A <strong>new hard-money European currency bloc</strong> (presaging the euro) strong enough to challenge the dollar.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>"It is at least possible that the future will see gold and the hard European currencies at last dethrone the triumphant but increasingly uneasy dollar."</blockquote>
