# CHUNK 1: Front Matter, Introduction, Chapters 1-3

## Tyson's Keys to Personal Financial Success (Summary Page)

1. **Don't buy depreciating consumer items on credit.** Use debt only for things that gain value: real estate, a business, or an education.
2. **Credit cards are for convenience, not for carrying debt.** If you tend to run up balances, switch to cash, checks, and debit cards only.
3. **Live within your means.** Many people engaging in conspicuous consumption are borrowing against their future; some end up bankrupt.
4. **Save and invest at least 5 to 10 percent of your income.** Preferably through a retirement savings account for the tax reduction.
5. **Avoid financial products with high commissions and expenses.**
6. **Never purchase a financial product you don't understand.**
7. **Invest the majority of long-term money in ownership vehicles** (stocks, real estate, your own business).
8. **Avoid emotionally based financial decisions.**
9. **Ignore financial prognosticators.** Nobody has a working crystal ball.
10. **Own your home.** In the long run, owning is more cost-effective than renting.
11. **Purchase broad insurance for catastrophes; eliminate insurance for small potential losses.**
12. **If married, discuss joint goals.**
13. **Hire yourself first.** You are the best financial person you can hire.
14. **Invest in yourself and others.** Education, health, relationships.

## Chapter 1: Embracing Financial Literacy

### The State of Financial Literacy
- Most Americans, especially younger adults, score below 60% on financial literacy surveys.
- Root cause: Most were never taught personal finance. In some families, kids hear about money only during disagreements and crises.

### Three Pillars of Financial Literacy
1. Managing everyday transactions
2. Investing for the long term
3. Protecting your money

### Unreliable Sources of Financial Information
- **Advertising conflicts:** Publications may avoid articles that upset advertisers.
- **Advertorials:** Content written by advertisers, sometimes not clearly labeled.
- **Affiliate relationships:** Websites earn referral fees for recommendations.
- **Celebrity endorsers are dangerous:** FTX spent hundreds of millions on celebrity endorsers (Shaquille O'Neil, Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Larry David, etc.). Celebrities have no special financial knowledge.

### The Wade Cook Case Study
- Stock market average annual returns: ~9%
- Wade Cook promoted seminars promising 300% annualized returns ($6,000+ per seminar).
- If you could actually earn 300% annually, starting with $10,000, you'd top the world's wealthiest list in 11 years.
- Cook's own firm lost 89% of its money trading.
- He eventually served a 7-year prison term for tax evasion.

---

## Chapter 2: Establishing a Financial Foundation

### Cash Flow
- Cash flow = Income - Expenditures
- If you're already a good saver, you may NOT need to track spending.

### Transaction Accounts
- Consider small banks, credit unions, and online banks.
- FDIC insurance: $250,000 single, $500,000 joint.
- Keep only enough in checking for monthly needs.
- **Money-market funds generally pay higher rates than bank savings accounts** despite lacking FDIC insurance.

### Budgeting Framework
- At 30% marginal tax rate, you only need to cut spending by 7% to save 10% (via tax-sheltered retirement account).

### Credit Scores and Reports
- FICO range: 300-850. Median: ~720. Best rates: mid-700s+.
- Free credit report every 12 months from each bureau via annualcreditreport.com.
- FICO score: $19.95 per bureau request.

## Chapter 3: Measuring Your Financial Health

### Common Money Mistakes
1. Not planning
2. Overspending
3. Buying with consumer credit
4. Delaying retirement saving
5. Falling prey to financial sales pitches
6. Not doing homework
7. Making decisions based on emotion
8. Not separating wheat from chaff
9. Exposing yourself to catastrophic risk
10. Focusing too much on money

### Net Worth Calculation
- Financial Assets - Financial Liabilities = Net Worth
- Exclude personal residence unless you plan to sell.
- Consumer items (cars, clothing) are NOT assets.

### Bad Debt vs. Good Debt
- **Bad debt:** Consumer items that decrease in value. High interest, not tax-deductible.
- **Good debt:** Real estate, small business, education. Lower interest, usually tax-deductible.
- Healthy amount of bad debt = zero.
- Bad debt danger ratio >25% of annual income = real trouble.

### Savings Rate Target
- At least 5-10% of annual income for longer-term goals.
- Emergency fund: 3-6 months of living expenses.

# CHUNK 2: Chapters 4-7 (partial)

## Chapter 4: Establishing and Achieving Goals

### Money Does Not Equal Happiness
- Despite incomes doubling over decades, Americans are not happier.
- "Satisfaction isn't so much getting what you want as wanting what you have."

### Prioritizing Savings Goals
1. Owning your home
2. Making major purchases
3. Retiring / achieving financial independence
4. Educating the kids
5. Owning your own business

### Retirement Account Advantages
1. Contributions usually tax-deductible
2. Employer matching = free money
3. Tax-deferred compounding

### Emergency Reserve Tiers

| Situation | Recommended Reserve |
|---|---|
| Stable income, other accounts to borrow from | 3 months |
| Some job instability, no easy borrowing | 6 months |
| Fluctuating income, high risk, no borrowing options | Up to 12 months |

### Preparing for Retirement

**How Much Income You Need (% of Pre-Retirement):**

| Profile | % Needed |
|---|---|
| High earner, saves 15%+, owns home debt-free | 65% |
| Moderate saver (5-14%), some mortgage | 75% |
| Saves little (<5%), significant mortgage | 85% |

### Social Security
- Eligibility: 40 quarters of work credits (~10 years).
- Average monthly benefit: ~$1,830. Maximum: ~$3,630.
- Full retirement age: 67 (born after 1959).

### Growth Multiplier (how $1 of current savings grows by age 66)
- Age 26: 4.8x
- Age 40: 2.8x
- Age 50: 1.9x
- Age 60: 1.3x

---

## Chapter 5: Managing Where Your Money Goes

- Tyson has seen $50K earners who save 20% and $100K earners who save nothing.
- If you earn $50K and spend all of it, someone else makes do on $45K.

### Why People Overspend
1. Easy access to credit
2. Credit card misuse (minimum payments = decades of debt)
3. Car loans framed as monthly payments
4. Social pressure
5. Emotional/retail therapy

### Spending Tracker Apps
- Largely negative view: loaded with advertising, affiliate conflicts, security concerns.
- Exception: Tyson likes **Goodbudget**.

---

## Chapter 6: Dealing with Debt

### Using Savings to Reduce Consumer Debt
- Paying off 12% credit card = guaranteed, tax-free 12% return.
- To justify NOT paying off 12% debt, you'd need ~18% pre-tax return.

### Five Sources to Pay Down Debt
1. Borrow against cash value life insurance
2. Sell non-retirement investments
3. Tap home equity
4. Borrow against employer retirement account
5. Borrow from family

### Credit Card Traps
- Teaser rates (1.9%) jump to ~15% after 6 months.
- One late payment can trigger penalty rates of 19.8-29%+.
- No grace period on new purchases if carrying a balance.

### Credit Counseling Warning
- Most agencies are funded by creditor fees = essentially collection agencies.
- Red flag: If they offer Debt Management Programs (DMPs), do NOT work with them.
- Recommended: Institute for Financial Literacy (207-873-0068).

### Bankruptcy
- Consider when consumer-debt-to-income exceeds 25%.
- Chapter 7: Discharges eligible debts entirely.
- Chapter 13: Court-supervised repayment schedule.
- Stays on credit report up to 10 years; most lenders ignore after 5-7 years.

## Chapter 7 (partial): Reducing Your Spending

### Four Keys to Successful Spending
1. Live within your means
2. Find the best values (total long-term cost)
3. Cut excess spending
4. Shun consumer credit

---

# CHUNK 3: Chapters 7 (cont'd), 8, and 9 (intro)

## Chapter 7 (continued): Reducing Your Spending

### Complaint Resolution: Document, Escalate, Share, Litigate
- Always buy with credit card (if paying in full) -- 60 days to dispute charges.

### Rent-to-Own: The Worst Way to Buy
- A $489 TV ends up costing $1,800+. Effective interest rate exceeds 100-200%.

### Food Strategies
- Install a water filtration system instead of buying bottled water -- 100%+ ROI after first year.
- Wholesale superstores (Costco, Sam's Club) charge ~30% less than retail.

### Transportation
- Cars are NOT investments. Don't finance car purchases.
- Each 5 mph over 60 reduces fuel economy by ~7%.
- Don't lease, don't borrow -- buy with cash or buy quality used.

### Insurance Premium Traps
1. Keeping low deductibles (higher deductibles save money long-term)
2. Covering small potential losses
3. Failing to shop around

### Taxes and Spending Connection
- Retirement savings plans reduce taxes, but you must spend less than you earn first.

# CHUNK 4: Chapters 9 (cont'd), 10, and 11 (beginning)

## Chapter 9: Investment Concepts

### Lender vs. Owner Investments
1. **Lending:** CDs, bonds, Treasuries. Fixed returns. Hidden risk: inflation erosion.
2. **Ownership:** Stocks, real estate, small business. Share in profits and losses.

### Inflation's Impact on Purchasing Power (After 10 Years)
| Inflation Rate | Purchasing Power Loss |
|---|---|
| 2% | -18% |
| 4% | -32% |
| 6% | -44% |
| 8% | -54% |

### Gambling vs. Investing
- Casinos/lotteries pay out 50-60 cents on the dollar.
- Futures, options, derivatives = gambling for individuals.
- Day trading = speculation. Inevitably underperforms market averages.
- Cryptocurrencies: Over 23,000 emerged; nearly all were poor investments.

### Historical Returns

| Investment Type | Average Annual Return |
|---|---|
| Stocks & investment real estate | ~9% |
| Bonds | ~5% |
| Savings accounts | ~4% |
| Inflation | ~3% |

### $10,000 Invested Over Time

| Return Rate | After 25 Years | After 40 Years |
|---|---|---|
| 4% | $26,658 | $48,010 |
| 5% | $33,863 | $70,400 |
| 9% | $86,231 | $314,094 |

### Stocks vs. Bonds by Holding Period

| Years Held | Likelihood Stocks Beat Bonds |
|---|---|
| 1 year | 60% |
| 5 years | 70% |
| 10 years | 80% |
| 20 years | 91% |
| 30 years | 99% |

### Asset Allocation -- Age-Based Framework

| Investor Type | Bond Allocation | Stock Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative | = Your age | = 100 - age |
| Middle-of-the-road | = Age - 10 | = 110 - age |
| Aggressive | = Age - 20 | = 120 - age |

International stocks: 20-50% of stock allocation depending on risk tolerance.

### Dollar-Cost Averaging
- Invest equal chunks on a regular basis into diversified investments.
- Best when lump sum is a large portion of total assets.

### Commission Table -- What Brokers Earn

| Investment Type | Commission on $20K | Commission on $100K |
|---|---|---|
| Annuities | $1,400 | $7,000 |
| Limited partnerships | $1,800 | $9,000 |
| Load mutual funds | $1,200 | $5,000 |
| Options & futures | $2,000+ | $10,000+ |

---

## Chapter 10: Understanding Your Investment Choices

### Bonds
- Values move inversely to interest rates.
- AAA = highest safety; BB or B = "junk" (1-2% default probability).
- Longer maturity = higher yield but more price fluctuation.

### Stocks
- Historical return: ~9% annual average.
- Average P/E ratio: ~15.
- 20th century: Dow fell >20% during 16 different periods; average decline lasted <2 years.

### Mutual Funds vs. Individual Stocks
- Need 15-20 different securities to diversify adequately.
- Limit individual stock holdings to no more than 20% of total investments.

### Real Estate
- Comparable to stock returns over generations.
- Leverage: Can borrow 80-90%+ of property value.
- Best investments: single-family homes, small multi-unit buildings.
- Worst: Limited partnerships (10%+ commission), time-shares, second homes.

### Cryptocurrencies -- Critique
- No recourse, no inherent value, not truly scarce (25,000+ exist), not widely accepted, problematic exchanges (FTX collapse).

### Annuities
- Only consider AFTER fully funding all tax-deductible retirement accounts.

### Loads (Sales Commissions)
- Range from 3% to 8.5% of investment -- avoid entirely.

---

### Prioritization Hierarchy
1. Employer plans with matching
2. Other employer/self-employed plans with tax deductions
3. IRA (standard or Roth)
4. Annuity (last resort)

### Company Stock Rule
- Limit to 20-25% maximum of retirement account. (Remember Enron.)

---

## Chapter 13: Investing in Taxable Accounts

### Money-Market Fund Selection
- Not high tax bracket: Fidelity Government Cash Reserves, Vanguard Cash Reserves
- High state bracket: U.S. Treasury money-market funds
- High federal AND state: State-focused tax-free money-market funds
- High federal, low state: Federal-tax-free-only money-market funds

### CDs vs. Bonds
- Expect 1-2% more per year in bond funds than CDs.
- Don't buy CDs just for FDIC insurance.

---

## Chapter 14 (partial): Educational Expenses

### College Costs

---

# CHUNK 6: Chapters 14 (cont'd), 15, and 16 (opening)

## Chapter 14 (continued): Paying for College

### Retirement Accounts and Financial Aid
- Retirement plan balances are NOT counted as assets in financial aid analysis.
- Colleges expect 20% of money in child's name annually vs. 6% in parent's name.
- Save in YOUR name, not the child's.

### 529 Plans
- Can put $300,000+ per beneficiary.
- Front-loading: up to $85,000 per donor ($150,000 married) at once.
- Tax-free growth and withdrawal for education expenses.
- Can fund up to $10,000/year for K-12 private school.

### Loan Programs
- Federal student loans have variable rates tied to Treasury bills, with caps.
- PLUS loans: parents can borrow full remaining amount after other aid.
- IRA withdrawals for college: penalty-free but taxed as income -- absolute last resort.

---

## Chapter 15: Investing in Real Estate

### Buy vs. Rent
- Don't buy unless you can stay 3+ years (preferably 5+).
- Transaction costs require ~15% appreciation to break even.
- Lenders limit housing costs to 35-40% of gross income.

### Mortgage Multiplier (by interest rate)
- 3%: 5.0x income | 5%: 4.2x | 7%: 3.5x | 9%: 2.9x

### Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate
- ARM typical caps: 2%/year, 5-6% lifetime.
- Loans to avoid: balloon, negative amortization, interest-only, prepayment penalties.

### Down Payment
- 20% down avoids PMI (0.5-1.0% of mortgage/year).
- 15-year vs. 30-year: 30-year offers flexibility; can make extra payments voluntarily.

### Refinancing Payback
- Factor in lost tax deductions: $100/month savings at 27% rate = $73 real savings.

### Reverse Mortgages (age 62+)
- Tax-free payments from lender against equity.
- Alternative: sell and use capital gains exclusion ($250K single, $500K married).

### Selling
- Agent commissions: 5-6% (negotiable). Above $500K, push for 4%.

---

# CHUNK 7: Chapters 16 (cont'd), 17, and 18 (partial)

## Chapter 16: Insurance Fundamentals

### Three Laws of Insurance
1. **Insure for big stuff, not small stuff.** Raise deductibles ($250 to $1,000 saves 15-20%).
2. **Buy broad coverage.** Life insurance > flight insurance. Major medical > cancer insurance.
3. **Shop around and buy direct.** Commissions are never disclosed in documents.

### Policies to Avoid
- Extended warranties, home warranty plans, dental (individual), credit life/disability, daily hospitalization, mail package insurance, cellphone insurance.
- On average, insurance companies pay out only 60 cents per dollar collected. Many small-potato policies pay back ~20 cents.

### Commission Rates
- Life and disability: 50% of first year's premium.
- Cash value life insurance: 80-100% of first year's premium.

---

## Chapter 17: Insurance on You

### Life Insurance
**Who doesn't need it:** Single without children, working couples on one income, independently wealthy, retired, minor children.

**How much:** Multiply after-tax income by factor based on years to replace (5 years = 4.5x, 10 = 8.5x, 20 = 15x, 30 = 20x).

### Term vs. Cash Value: Buy Term
- Cash value costs ~8x (800%) more for the same coverage.
- Agent commissions: 8-10x more for cash value than term.
- Cash value = "the most oversold insurance and financial product in history."

### Disability Insurance
- More than 1/3 of all disabilities strike people under 45.
- Replace full monthly take-home pay.
- If YOU pay premiums, benefits are tax-free.
- Recommended waiting period: 3-6 months.

### Health Insurance
- ACA: Must cover adult children to age 26. No preexisting condition exclusions.
- Open enrollment: November 1 - January 15.
- HSA contribution limits: $3,850 single / $7,750 family (requires high-deductible plan).
- Medical expense deduction threshold: 7.5% of AGI.

---

# CHUNK 8: Chapters 18 (cont'd), 19, 20, 21, 22 (partial)

## Chapter 18: Estate Planning

### Wills
- Essential when you have minor children.
- You do NOT need an attorney -- three witnesses make it valid.

### Living Trusts
- Avoid probate (5%+ of estate in legal fees).
- Most valuable for: age 60+, single, assets >$100,000, property in multiple states.
- Do NOT minimize estate taxes -- only avoid probate.

### Estate Tax Thresholds
- Individual: $12.92 million exempt. Married: $25.84 million.
- Annual gift exclusion: $17,000 per beneficiary.

---

## Chapter 19: Working with Financial Planners

### Three Compensation Models
1. **Commission-based** (worst): Not really planners -- they're salespeople.
2. **Percentage-of-AUM** (better but flawed): ~1% annually. Won't recommend strategies that reduce their asset pool.
3. **Hourly-based** (Tyson's preferred): $100-several hundred/hour. No product sales = objectivity.

### Major Conflicts of Interest
- Not recommending employer retirement plans (no commission in it).
- Ignoring consumer debts (paying off reduces investable assets).
- Not recommending real estate or small business (takes money away from securities).
- Creating dependency by making finances seem impossibly complicated.

---

## Chapter 20: Technology

### Recommended Tools
- Expense tracking: Goodbudget, GasBuddy, CamelCamelCamel
- Retirement planning: T. Rowe Price, Vanguard calculators
- Tax prep: TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxAct
- Economic data: FRED (fred.stlouisfed.org)

### Robo Advisors
- Betterment/WealthFront: 0.25-0.5%/year.
- Vanguard Digital Advisor has lowest fees.

---

## Chapter 21: Consuming Financial Content

### Media Warnings
- Stock market panic: Dow fell below 6,500 in early 2009; has since risen more than 5x. Those who sold missed the recovery.
- More than 6 in 10 Americans believed another Great Depression was imminent in late 2008 -- the fear exacerbated the decline.
- Social media stock-picking gurus rarely post trades in advance, delete bad calls, and report self-calculated returns with no audit.

---

- Priority: pay down debts, then diversify.

### Retiring
- Plan activities, not just finances.
- Pension option: 75% joint and survivor is popular middle ground.
- You may no longer need disability insurance but may need more liability insurance.

1. Never give personal info over phone on inbound calls (numbers can be spoofed).
2. Never respond to phishing emails.
3. Review monthly financial statements.

8. Keep personal info off checks.
9. Protect computer with firewall and virus protection.
10. Protect mail: use locked mailbox, use fraud-prevention pens, sign up for automatic bill payment.
