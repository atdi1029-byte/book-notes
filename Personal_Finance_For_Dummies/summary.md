## Key Takeaways

1. **Live below your means and save 5-10% of income** -- preferably through tax-advantaged retirement accounts. At a 30% tax bracket, saving 10% only requires cutting spending by 7%.

2. **Eliminate all consumer debt.** Paying off 12% credit card debt is equivalent to earning a guaranteed, tax-free 12% return. The healthy amount of consumer debt is zero.

3. **Invest long-term money in ownership assets** (stocks, real estate, small business) -- they return ~9% historically vs. ~5% for bonds and ~4% for savings. Over 40 years, $10K at 9% becomes $314K vs. $48K at 4%.

4. **Use index funds.** They outperform ~75% of actively managed funds over 10+ years, primarily because of lower fees (~0.1% vs. 1.1% average).

5. **Buy term life insurance, never cash value.** Cash value costs 8x more for the same coverage. Agents push it because they earn 8-10x higher commissions.

6. **Insure only against catastrophes.** Raise deductibles, skip small-potato policies (extended warranties, cellphone insurance, etc.). Insurance companies pay out only 60 cents per dollar collected on average.

7. **You are your own best financial advisor.** Commission-based advisors have structural conflicts of interest. If you hire help, use hourly fee-only advisors.

8. **Max out retirement accounts before all other investing.** Prioritize: (1) employer plans with matching, (2) other employer/self-employed plans, (3) IRA/Roth, (4) taxable accounts.

9. **Don't try to time the market or pick stocks.** Nobody can reliably predict markets. Day trading is gambling. Buy-and-hold outperforms active trading for the vast majority of investors.

10. **Own your home when you can stay 3-5+ years.** Fixed mortgage payments don't rise with inflation; rent does. Over 20-30 years, owning becomes significantly cheaper.

## Deeper Breakdowns by Theme

### Budgeting & Spending
- Track spending only if you're not saving enough. If already saving well, don't obsess over every dollar.
- The biggest lever is cutting expenses -- a $1,000/year reduction invested in a retirement account compounds dramatically over decades.
- Avoid rent-to-own (100-200% effective interest), car leases, and buying consumer items on credit.
- Wholesale superstores save ~30% on groceries. Water filters beat bottled water with 100%+ ROI.

### Debt Management
- Bad debt (consumer) vs. good debt (real estate, education, business). Even good debt can be excessive.
- Consumer-debt-to-income ratio >25% = danger zone; consider bankruptcy.
- Credit counseling agencies are largely biased -- funded by creditors, they function as collection agencies.
- Strategies: transfer balances to lower-rate cards, use savings to pay off high-interest debt, convert consumer debt to mortgage debt (lower rate + tax deduction).

### Investing
- **Two types:** Lending (bonds, CDs) and ownership (stocks, real estate, business). Ownership assets produce higher long-term returns.
- **Asset allocation rule:** Subtract your age from 110 for stock percentage (moderate risk). A 40-year-old: 70% stocks, 30% bonds.
- **International diversification:** 20-35% of stock allocation should be international.
- **Rebalance every 2-3 years**, not more frequently.
- **Dollar-cost averaging** eases into volatile investments; best when a lump sum is a large portion of assets.
- **Avoid:** day trading, options/futures, cryptocurrency speculation, limited partnerships, most hedge funds.

### Taxes
- Know your marginal tax bracket -- it determines the value of every deduction and retirement contribution.
- No-income-tax states: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming.
- Donating appreciated stock gives a double tax benefit: full market value deduction + avoids capital gains tax.
- A fund averaging 14%/year pre-tax can net less than a 12%/year fund after taxes.
- SALT deduction capped at $10,000. Mortgage interest deduction capped at $750K of debt.

### Retirement Accounts
- **401(k):** $22,500 limit ($30K if 50+). Don't leave employer match money on the table.
- **Roth IRA:** No upfront deduction but tax-free withdrawals. AGI limits: $138K single, $218K married.
- **SEP-IRA (self-employed):** Up to 20% of net income, max $66,000.
- **Don't put in retirement accounts:** Municipal bonds, annuities, limited partnerships.
- **RMDs:** Start at age 73 (moving to 75 in 2033).
- **Inherited accounts:** Must be emptied within 10 years.

### Real Estate
- Buy when you can stay 3-5+ years. Transaction costs require ~15% appreciation to break even.
- 20% down avoids PMI (0.5-1% of mortgage/year).
- 30-year mortgage offers flexibility over 15-year -- you can voluntarily pay extra.
- Better to contribute extra money to retirement accounts than pay down mortgage faster (tax deduction + financial aid protection).
- Refinance makes sense when you can recover costs within a few years. Factor in lost tax deductions.

### Insurance
- **Three laws:** (1) Insure catastrophes, skip small stuff. (2) Buy broad coverage, not narrow. (3) Shop around, buy direct.
- **Life:** Term only. Buy enough to replace 10-20 years of income if dependents rely on you.
- **Disability:** Replace full take-home pay. Waiting period of 3-6 months reduces premiums.
- **Health:** Take highest deductible you can afford. Use HSA ($3,850/$7,750 limits) for triple tax benefit.
- **Home:** Get guaranteed replacement cost. Standard policies exclude flood and earthquake -- buy separately.
- **Auto:** $500-$1,000 deductible. Drop comprehensive/collision as car ages.
- **Umbrella:** Cheap protection ($200/year for $1M). Cover at least 2x your assets.

### Education Planning
- **Save for retirement first, education second.** Retirement accounts aren't counted in financial aid; education savings are.
- **529 plans:** Tax-free growth/withdrawal for education. Best for affluent families unlikely to get aid.
- **Money in child's name:** Colleges expect 20% annually vs. 6% in parent's name.
- **Alternatives to traditional college:** Coding boot camps (~$13K), apprenticeships, trade schools.
- **Average aid discount at private colleges:** ~50% of sticker price. Always apply for aid regardless.

### Financial Advisors
- Commission-based = salespeople. Percentage-of-AUM = better but still conflicted. Hourly fee-only = best.
- Key question: "What percentage of your income comes from fees vs. commissions?" Right answer: 100% fees.
- Verify via SEC (adviserinfo.sec.gov) or state regulators.
- NAPFA (napfa.org) for fee-only planner referrals.

### Estate Planning
- Everyone with minor children needs a will. You don't need an attorney.
- Living trusts avoid probate (5%+ of estate in legal fees) but don't reduce estate taxes.
- Estate tax exemption: $12.92M individual, $25.84M married.
- Annual gift exclusion: $17,000 per beneficiary.

### Identity Theft Protection
- Rotate free credit reports every 4 months (one agency each time) for year-round monitoring.
- Freeze credit reports (free by law) -- most effective protection.
- One credit card is enough. Close unnecessary accounts.
- Never give personal info on inbound calls (numbers can be spoofed).

## Contrarian Ideas Worth Remembering

1. You don't need to track every dollar if you're already saving enough.
2. Money-market funds are preferable to bank savings despite lacking FDIC insurance.
3. Don't count your home as a financial asset unless you plan to sell.
4. Consumer items (cars) are not assets -- many financial tools wrongly list them.
5. "Safe" investments (savings accounts) can be the riskiest for long-term goals due to inflation.
6. Paying down your mortgage faster is often the wrong move vs. funding retirement accounts.
7. Most home renovations never recoup their cost.
8. Free online financial content is often the most conflicted (advertiser influence, affiliate kickbacks).
9. Having too much in retirement accounts can backfire (forced RMDs push you into higher brackets).
10. Short-term stock trading is gambling, not investing.
