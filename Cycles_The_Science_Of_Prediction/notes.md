## Introduction: Concerning Economic Prediction

- Science's business is to predict — astronomy, chemistry, nuclear physics all make accurate predictions. Economics is now reaching a point where it too can make rather accurate predictions within limits.
- The book abandons the classical cause-and-effect approach to economics in favor of studying rhythmic patterns and periodic cycles.
- The law of averages applies to humanity — certain activities of people fall into definite patterns, some with periodic rhythm. These patterns reveal how masses are likely to act at given times — a formulation of law.
- The "forecasts" in this book are written by the data themselves — they are tendencies, probabilities of tomorrow, not opinions of any man.

> "To be completely exposed to surprise by events — in the complex age we live in — is a fair route to the insane asylum."

> "When a people finds that predictions of many financial advisers, statesmen, historians, and other proclaimed experts are seldom better than the predictions of the astrologers, our social sciences have demonstrably not been earning their way. It is time for action."

## Chapter I: Why Trends Are Important

### Growth as a Universal Pattern
- All organisms show declining rates of growth over time — babies grow 100%+ in year one, then the rate steadily falls until maturity when it reaches zero.
- An inhibiting growth factor exists in all organisms — babies, trees, and also human institutions and business organizations.
- A hypothetical business showing $20,000 sales in year 1 grows to $609,000 by year 40, but the *rate* of growth declines steadily (90% → 80% → 70%... → 20% → 10% → 0%).

### The Trend and the Cycle
- Business cycles are not departures from a horizontal line — they are waves moving around a curved axis (the trend).
- Think of cycles as peaks of a fence going up and down a hill, or a coil spring stretched over a bent poker.
- Key insight: when the trend is rising rapidly, even a depression bottom may be *higher* than previous peaks. When the trend levels out, depressions become absolute in character.

### U.S. Industrial Production (1884–1937)
- Pre-1920: trend rising rapidly, depression lows (a, b, c) were still as high as earlier peaks (A, B, C).
- Post-1920: trend leveled out, depressions became genuinely painful — no rising trend to compensate.
- After 1918, a greater premium than ever before is placed on the ability to time business cycle turns correctly.

### Spanish Trade (1503–1660)
- E.J. Hamilton's data on Spanish Empire trade shows the same pattern: growth trend with increasing intensity of depressions as the trend approaches maturity.

> "The businessman is going to have to anticipate depressions and plan for them wisely, or suffer unprecedented penalties."

## Chapter II: Patterns in Growth of Organisms

### The Logistic Curve (S-Curve)
- Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins discovered that growth follows a universal law — the logistic curve (first described by Belgian mathematician P.F. Verhulst in 1838).
- The same S-shaped growth curve appears in: body weight of white rats, weight of pumpkins, yeast cell populations, fruit fly populations, and human populations.

### Population Growth Follows the Same Law
- Sweden, United States, France, Algeria, Germany — all follow the logistic curve despite wars, emigration, immigration, plagues, and birth control.
- **Sweden:** grew like a population of yeast cells in quantitative relations.
- **United States:** upper limit of present cycle projected at ~197 million.
- **France:** took 400+ years for its growth cycle; upper limit ~42.5 million.
- **Algeria:** completed an entire growth cycle (youth to maturity) in less than 100 years under French colonial control.
- **Germany:** two overlapping growth cycles visible — old agricultural cycle reaching maturity mid-1800s, new industrial cycle beginning ~1848–1870.

### Key Principles
- When a consistent pattern of growth exists, we have sound grounds for making predictions.
- New cycles of growth can be superimposed on old ones — triggered by revolutions in constitution, environment, or where the pattern is being worked out.
- A renaissance in growth pattern does NOT occur except concurrently with revolutionary changes in the environment.
- Growth patterns are consistent — they do not change capriciously. There seems no reason to expect any change unless we also imply a revolution in the constitution of the organism or its environment.

> "When human social evolution does manage to put a kink in the curve of population growth, it has not done it by altering any biological law. It merely shifts, by a greater or smaller amount, the absolute base from which the law operates."

## Chapter III: The Growth Trend in Our Basic Industries

### Ratio Scale Method
- Using ratio (logarithmic) scale instead of arithmetic scale reveals the rate of growth, making the logistic curve visible as a smooth elongated curve.
- This is more useful than Pearl's equation method for the average businessman — just chart on semi-log paper.

### U.S. Manufactures (1830–1945)
- Rate of growth declining since ~1900; by 1920 it had become a fraction of 1800s rates.
- WWII production peak can be ignored — it was destruction, not creative production. Trend line tells the real story.

### Exports and Imports (1830–1945)
- Both follow the same logistic growth pattern.
- Export levels established during WWII (via lend-lease) will return to trend — unless we keep giving goods away.
- Import peak was reached in the 1920s decade — no evidence the peak will ever be importantly exceeded.

### Iron and Steel
- An "old industry" since 1914 — each depression carried production to lower levels than previous ones (sign of declining vitality).
- WWII peak was "an explosion" not creative construction — will return to trend.
- Average annual production ~40 million gross tons as the mean around which future fluctuations will oscillate.

### Steam Railways
- Reached maturity between 1910–1914 in mileage operated; actual decline in per capita freight since then.
- By 1943 (peak war effort), total tonnage originated was only 9% more than 1929; per capita it was actually less.

### Shipbuilding
- WWI raised shipbuilding twentyfold; WWII similarly inflated. Both return to trend.

### Automobiles
- Industry's rate of growth was declining sharply well before 1940, approaching maturity.
- Fortune estimated 4.5 million cars annually from mid-1945 would completely saturate the market by 1950.

### Horse-Drawn Vehicles
- Example of an industry superseded before reaching natural maturity — destroyed by the automobile.

### Agricultural Industries (Cattle, Corn, Cotton, Wool, Wheat, Malt Liquors)
- All show the same logistic growth pattern approaching maturity.
- Cotton: two distinct trends — before and after the Civil War.
- Wool: two distinct trends — before and after the Tariff Act of 1924.
- Malt Liquors: shows clear effect of Prohibition creating a massive dip.

### Mature Industries (Lumber, Cotton Spindles, Coal, Copper, Lead)
- All approaching or past maturity.
- Copper: birth of the electrical industry in 1880 launched a new growth cycle.
- Lead: junction of Union Pacific and Central Pacific in 1869 opened western ores, starting a second cycle.

### Key Takeaway
- America's basic economic fabric has reached or is reaching maturity. "Any talk of unlimited frontiers that lie before us is a pure expression of faith and hope. The statistical evidence does not support it."
- This is not tragic — it's a fact. We can adjust, or we can try to break the bonds holding us.

> "Like goldfish nibbling at the glass of their bowl, we have demonstrably been reaching the circumference of our economic world-as-it-is."

## Chapter IV: Trends in Some Other Industries

### New vs. Old Industries
- No single new industry can absorb unemployment slack or "spring full-blown upon the world."
- Industries follow orderly growth patterns — they don't appear fully formed.
- Any great industry capable of creating impressive postwar employment is already on the scene with an established rate of growth.

### Younger Industries with Growth Ahead
- **Rayon:** Typical of young chemical industries. Gratifying growth trend, but chemical industries create practically no direct employment compared to older industries.
- **Aircraft:** A baby industry before the war; war gave it munitions status. Postwar reversion to youthful dimensions was inevitable — two million wartime employees reduced to a tenth by mid-1946.
- **Electric Energy, Natural Gas, Petroleum, Paper & Wood Pulp:** Still have natural expansion ahead. Electronics and certain chemicals still almost in infancy.
- **Radio & Electrical Refrigeration:** Not as young as some suppose — already slowing markedly in rate of growth before the war.

### Roger Babson's Growth Curve Chart
- Composite chart placing various U.S. industries on a single growth curve according to their comparable age/rate of growth.
- Young/fast-growing industries appear at left (Television, Airplanes, Radio); mature/declining ones at right (Horse-Drawn Vehicles, Cotton Spindles).
- Key question for any corporation: Is high sales volume due to youthful growth rate, or merely a cyclical upsweep that will be compensated by decline?

### Key Insight
- Knowledge of prevailing trends provides the first key required for answering questions about any corporation or economy.
- When we know the cycle, we can isolate its effect from the trend and study them separately. Without knowing cycles first, trend studies are purely tentative.

> "Like the weatherman, we are concerned initially not with altering the weather, but with the problem of predicting it with fair accuracy."

## Chapter V: Some Rhythmic Cycles in Natural Phenomena

### Definitions
- **Cycle:** From Greek "circle" — any regularity in time intervals, but not necessarily equal intervals.
- **Rhythm / Rhythmic cycle:** A cycle repeating at rather uniform time intervals. Implies a kind of beat (like a heartbeat — rhythmic though slightly irregular).
- **Periodicity / Periodic cycle / Regular cycle:** A cycle repeating at mathematically exact intervals. True periodicity does not exist in nature, but close approximations do.

### The 9⅔-Year Rhythm in Nature
- **Atlantic Salmon** (Restigouche River, Canada, 1880–1929): Five clear maxima showing ~9⅔-year periodicity in catch per rod per day.
- **Lynx** (Hudson's Bay Company pelts, 1844–1933): Dramatic 9⅔-year cycle in offerings. Evidenced back to 1735. Fluctuations from 4,000 skins in poor years to over 70,000 in good ones.
- **Tent Caterpillars** (New Jersey, 1913–1939): ~9.6-year cycle in complaint letters about the pest.
- **Other animals:** Similar ~10-year rhythms in Canadian marten, fisher, mink, muskrat, snowshoe rabbit ("varying hare").
- **Heart Disease:** Professor Ellsworth Huntington of Yale found 9⅔-year rhythm in death rate from heart disease in northeastern U.S.
- **Ozone** (London & Paris, 1877–1907): 9⅔-year cycle in atmospheric ozone, possibly linked to ultraviolet light.
- **Composite chart:** Tent caterpillars, salmon, lynx, heart disease, and ozone all plotted together show strikingly synchronized ~9⅔-year cycles.

### The 9-Year Rhythm (Distinct from the 9⅔-Year)
- A 9-year physical rhythm shows up in electrical phenomena — variations in electric charge in the terrestrial atmosphere.
- Visible in tree rings of California Sequoias and in important economic phenomena (discussed later in Ch. VII).

### The Brückner Weather Cycle (~35 Years)
- Sir Francis Bacon noted 300+ years ago that weather in the Low Countries repeats in 35-year cycles of great frosts, droughts, wet periods, warm summers.
- E. Brückner (Austrian, 1891) confirmed: European weather varies in cycles of ~35 years average.
- A 22-year weather rhythm has also been accumulated, matching a dominant sunspot cycle of ~22 years (C.N. Anderson).
- David Brunt (1927) traced 34 different weather rhythms with durations from under 2 years up.
- H.P. Gillette: basic climatic rhythm of 7.47 years. Multiplied by 3 → 22.4 years (matching sunspot/weather cycle).

### Solar and Terrestrial Rhythms
- 41-month rhythm in the solar constant (heat received from sun), matching an identical rhythm in atmospheric electricity.
- Sunspot rhythms: approximately 11 and 22 years in duration, plus other isolated cycles of about 9, 10, and 18 years.
- Solar constant follows a different course from sunspots but is also subject to rhythmic variations.
- Correlation does not prove causality — but one need not know the cause of night to know that morning will follow.

### The ~4-Year Biological Cycle
- Approximately 4 years: epidemics of lemmings, field mice, and the foxes that prey on them — in regions as far separated as Norway, Newfoundland, and New York.
- Voles (Germany, 1905–1916): regular 3 5/6-year cycle.
- Foxes (Norway, 1880–1931): 3 5/6-year cycle, cresting one year after the vole cycle.

### Rhythms in Human Emotion
- Professor Rex B. Hersey (U. of Pennsylvania): every individual has emotional ups and downs in rhythmic cycles, periods varying from 2½ to 9½ weeks.
- Charted emotional variations of Pennsylvania Railroad workers show clear rhythmic patterns.

### Rhythms in Disease
- Deaths from pneumonia and influenza show seasonal patterns AND a three-year rhythm (Metropolitan Life Insurance data, 1923–1928).

### Rhythms in Growth
- Tree growth (Sequoias, other species) and flower growth show rhythmic cycles.
- Sunspot abundance shows clear periodicity.
- Terrestrial magnetism variations mirror some of these cycles.

### Synthesis of Cycles
- Two or more regular cycles can be combined to produce a complex wave pattern.
- A chart of two superimposed cycles shows how combining simple rhythms creates apparently irregular but actually predictable patterns.
- Four cycles combined produce an even more complex-looking wave — yet it is entirely determined by the four component rhythms.

> "The student of periodic rhythms in human affairs has a tool which the law of averages itself puts into his hands."

## Chapter VI: The 54-Year Rhythm

### The Kondratieff / Long Wave
- A rhythmic cycle of ~54 years is apparent in many aspects of U.S. economic life. Its average length is almost exactly 54 years — longer than most individuals' economic lifetimes, so it readily escapes notice.
- Shows up most clearly in wholesale price swings. Interestingly, there has been no pronounced long-time *trend* in commodity prices — contrary to general belief.
- The U.S. has experienced three of these 54-year rhythms: each one saw average commodity prices begin at a low level, move up to a peak, and move down again to approximately the level they started from.

### 680 Years of Wheat Prices in England
- J. E. T. Rogers assembled invaluable wheat price data over several centuries — the longest price data available.
- Wheat prices (10-year averages, converted to equivalent cents-per-bushel on gold/silver basis) show a 54-year rhythm repeated 13½ times — too regular to be pure chance.
- Sir William H. Beveridge conducted periodogram analysis of wheat prices from medieval to modern times, finding strong correlation with known weather/sunspot phenomena at T = 54.00 years.

### The Kondratieff Wave in Economic History
- N. D. Kondratieff first impressed economists with evidence of this long wave. Joseph A. Schumpeter of Harvard confirmed and extended Kondratieff's findings.
- Schumpeter dates the first long cycle in modern American history from the 1780s to 1842, the second from 1842 to 1897, and the third from 1898 onward.
- Each Kondratieff cycle has been uniquely characterized by some great innovation: the first was the industrial revolution; the second was the age of steam, steel, and railroads; the third has been the age of chemistry, electricity, and motors.

### International Synchronization
- Wholesale prices and total exports for Germany, Great Britain, United States, and Japan all follow the same pattern in the 1930–1940 decade.
- The South Sea Bubble in England and the Mississippi Bubble in France developed concurrently and collapsed within the same month (1720). The 1929 American collapse was similarly synchronized worldwide.
- Schumpeter: "We not only know that all essential features of the post-war period up to the world crisis, but also those of the world crisis itself, answer perfectly to expectation from our model."

### Long Waves in Diverse Phenomena
- The 54-year rhythm appears in wages (agricultural laborers, cotton-textile workers in England), interest-bearing securities (French rente, English consols), coal production/consumption (England, France), pig iron and lead production (England), and commodity prices (England, France, United States — all on gold basis).
- Different industries and nations show the rhythm with varying clarity — as if different organisms respond to the same stimuli with different degrees of receptivity.

### The 54-Year Rhythm as an Economic Clock
- The 54-year price wave emanates from a 54-year wave in human activity — prices are only symbols.
- **Spring (Recovery):** Economy emerges from depression; venture capital starts; casual scatterings of seed grow into lush growth; great innovations planted in the previous cycle begin to spring up in full force.
- **Summer (Peak):** Employment grows; money flows; credit expands; midsummer arrives with million evidences of a new era; speculation regarding boundless future is rife (1929).
- **Autumn (Harvest):** Products of industry distributed more widely than ever; prices drift downward; wages stay up, increasing purchasing power for workers; but unemployment grows as manufacturers eliminate man-hours.
- **Winter (Depression):** Enterprise loses fervor; great fortunes no longer found by turning over a stone; people wonder if progress has stopped; mood of the late 1890s and possibly late 1940s/early 1950s.
- The 54-year rhythm has been on decline since the middle 1920s. In the middle 1950s it should be rising again — "almost miraculously, with a new spirit of enterprise revealing itself everywhere."

> "Anyone who starts out in business without knowing what time it is on the economic clock will obviously owe much to luck if he succeeds."

## Chapter VII: The 9-Year Rhythm

### The Juglar Cycle
- A rhythm close to 9 years in length appears in both commodity and stock prices. Not to be confused with the 9⅔-year biological rhythm.
- Schumpeter calls this the Juglar cycle, after the pioneering French economist Clément Juglar. Samuel Benner, an Ohio farmer, independently identified similar cycles in 1875.
- In pig iron prices, Benner cited 9-year cycles; in corn prices, 5½-year cycles; in cotton, 11-year cycles. The variations from a standard 9-year pattern in iron prices repeated every third cycle — if you had bought and sold pig iron on his projected pattern, your gains over a 69-year period would have been twelve times your loss.

### The 9-Year Rhythm in Stock Prices
- The Axe-Houghton Index of common stock prices (1854–1945), smoothed by 3-year and weighted 9-year moving averages, shows highs of regular 9⅙-year cycles falling in 1856.0, 1865.0, 1874.0, 1883.0, 1892.0, 1901.0, 1910.0, 1919.0, 1928.0, 1937.0, 1946.0, 1955.0, 1964.0, 1973.0, 1982.0, etc.
- A rhythm repeated as many as 10 times and as regularly as this cannot easily be the result of pure chance.
- The three deepest and longest depressions in the epoch — 1825–1830, 1873–1878, and 1929–1934 — all display this characteristic: the coincidence of corresponding phases of all three cycles (54-year, 9-year, and 3½-year).

### Interaction with the 54-Year Rhythm
- The 9-year wave rides on top of the 54-year wave. When both are rising together, there is great momentum in the market; when the 9-year reaches its crest and turns down while the 54-year is also declining, catastrophe follows (as in 1929).
- Three great wartime price peaks came at the top of the 9-year wave riding the crest of the 54-year wave, reinforced by incalculable war leverage — producing enormous inflation peaks.
- From 1946–1947 onward, both the 9-year and 54-year rhythms were reaching for a bottom around 1951–1952.

### Synthesis: The 9-Year and 54-Year Combined
- A composite chart combining the two rhythms, projected into the future, shows approximately what will happen (barring war distortions) if the rhythms continue.
- This synthesis could have predicted in advance that WWII prices would not rise as high as WWI levels (the 54-year wave was declining, only the 9-year and war leverage were pushing up).

### Gold Prices and Currency
- When the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1933, the economic upturn that followed was in harmony with the prevailing 9-year rhythm signaling a rise. The departure from gold may not have *caused* the recovery — the rhythm was already due to rise.

> "The explanation cannot be derived from them [external injuries]... The crisis was nowhere else anything like so severe as in the United States, the country most nearly free from injury by external factors."

## Chapter VIII: The 3½-Year Rhythm

### The Kitchin Cycle
- A rhythm of approximately 40.8 months (~3½ years) appears in the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production, pig iron production, common stock prices, and many other economic series.
- Estimated variously at 39 to 42 months in length. There may be two rhythmic tendencies — one slightly over 42 months, one slightly less than 40 — that combine to produce a seeming length of almost 41.
- Professor W. L. Crum (1923): ~40 months in commercial paper rates in New York (1866–1922). Joseph Kitchin: same rhythm in bank clearings, wholesale prices, and interest rates in both U.S. and Great Britain. Chapin Hoskins (1935): 40.5-month periodicity in pig iron and many other series. Schumpeter: five American systematic series gave mean duration of 42.05 months.

### Rate of Change Technique
- A rate-of-change graph reveals the hidden rhythm: instead of plotting actual production, plot each month's figure as a percentage of the corresponding month one year prior.
- The rhythm is not obvious in raw production charts but becomes strikingly clear in rate-of-change charts.
- In pig iron production: the regular 41-month cycle was determined and projected by Chapin Hoskins early in 1938. Projected highs of the regular cycle: July 1947, December 1950, May 1954. Projected lows: September 1948, February 1952.

### The 3½-Year Rhythm in Stock Prices
- The same 3½-year rhythm appears in Dow-Jones industrial common stock prices (1901–1946) and in the rate of change of stock prices.
- Projected highs of the regular 41-month cycle for stocks: February 1947, July 1950, December 1953. Projected lows: August 1948, January 1952.
- Historical note: around the end of 1926, the actual stock market pattern diverged from the ideal 3½-year wave. The pattern called for decline, but instead the market halted and then rose — nearly a year earlier than the ideal pattern called for — to the peak we know was reached in 1929. The overpowering forces of the 9-year and 54-year cycles meeting at confluence proved more powerful than the short 3½-year wave.

### Multiple Rhythms in Steel
- Steel is an involved industry affected by many rhythms: 54-year, 9-year, 3½-year, plus evidence of the 18-year rhythm and others (rhythms of 6, 7½, and 15 years, and shorter rhythms of 6, 9, 24, and 33 months).
- Out of more than 500 different economic series analyzed, something more than half show fluctuations of the 3½-year interval type.

### Stock Prices as Community Psychology
- Stock prices reflect a purely mental reality — they are an index to a mental attitude focused as desire. The stock market's rhythms are not located in Wall Street but are expressions of the human organism.
- In studying the market we are studying men in one of the fundamental aspects of their nature.

> "Much of the success or failure of an individual is due to forces over which he has no control; but if he understands these forces, he may protect himself from the worst results of unfavorable combinations and profit personally from favorable combinations."

## Chapter IX: The 18-Year Rhythm

### Real Estate and Building Activity
- The 18-year rhythmic cycle has an average length of ~18⅓ years — roughly a doubling of the 9-year rhythm.
- Shows up most clearly in real estate activity, building activity, and marriages.
- Real estate activity in the U.S. (1796–1946, compiled by Roy Wenzlick): ideal tops fall at 1888.6, 1907.0, 1925.3, 1943.6, 1962.6; ideal lows at 1897.8, 1916.2, 1934.5, 1952.8, 1971.2.
- Clarence D. Long, Jr.'s landmark study: cycles in building since 1900 were "about a third more severe than before" — four great waves in new construction since the Civil War, whose turning points "mark the most exciting and memorable episodes in the nation's history."

### Marriage Rate Follows the Same Rhythm
- Marriages per 10,000 adult males in St. Louis (1886–1934) show a regular 18⅓-year cycle — possibly linked to man's mating instinct being "aboriginally associated in his being" with nest-building instinct, as in birds.

### 18-Year Rhythm in Building and Construction
- Building activity in the U.S. (1830–1936, composite of Riggleman, Wenzlick, and 120-City-Index): pattern has tops at 1834.3, 1852.6, 1871.0, 1889.3, 1907.6, 1926.0, 1944.3, 1962.6.
- Brick production in England and Wales (1785–1849) shows the same ~18-year rhythm.
- Hamburg, Germany building construction (1885–1935) also shows the rhythm.
- New York and Chicago skyscrapers: most were built just at the top of building booms — and most had to stumble through subsequent depression.

### Building Peaks Predict Panics
- Major panics have tended to come within two to four years after building activity peaks: 1836 peak → panic 1837; 1853 peak → panic 1857; ~1871 peak → panic 1873; 1890 peak → panic 1893; 1906 peak → panic 1907; 1925 peak → panic 1929.
- Warren and Pearson: "When it is apparent that a building peak has been reached, it is a warning of the danger of a serious reaction. If there is also an impending rise in the value of gold, the danger is accentuated."

### The 18-Year Rhythm in Other Phenomena
- Also appears in pig iron production (deviations from normal trend), loans and discounts of American banks (with a 3-year lag behind building), railroad stock prices, common stock prices (Axe-Houghton index), and sales of individual industrial companies.
- The building cycle is so long that few people experience two complete cycles in their business life — education must therefore be "book knowledge" rather than experience.
- An individual's welfare is often determined by when in the cycle he was born — starting business at the low of a building cycle with falling commodity prices means good chances; starting at the peak means poor chances.

> "Four great waves in the construction of new buildings have occurred since the Civil War and it is not too much to say that their turning points mark the most exciting and memorable episodes in the nation's history."

## Chapter X: Causes, Correlations, Conjectures

### Summary of the Four Major Rhythms
- A. The 54-year rhythm in wholesale prices and industrial innovations.
- B. The 9-year rhythm in wholesale prices, security prices, pig iron production, and industrial activity.
- C. The 3½-year rhythm in security prices and in business activity, wholesale and retail.
- D. The 18-year rhythm in real estate activity and related industrial enterprise.

### Other Economic Rhythms
- 33-month rhythm in residential building activity; 23-month rhythm in textile production; 34-day (market day) rhythm in rate of change of raw sugar prices; 14.8-year rhythm in purchasing power of beef cattle prices; ~15-year rhythm in black pepper prices; 9-month rhythm in sales of a large industrial company.
- Many more exist — exhaustive analysis of any of them would involve us in the law of diminishing returns.

### The Question of Cause
- The four major rhythms (54, 9, 3½, 18⅓ years) provide measuring scales — like hands of an economic clock — as accurate a guide to timing as we may hope to establish.
- Ultimate cause is extremely difficult to discover — more a problem for philosophy than science. But we need not know the cause to use the patterns.
- With the discovery of rhythm in economic phenomena, the question changed from "why do we have business cycles?" to "Are the cycles really rhythmic? And if so, does the rhythm spring from within or without the economy?"

### Forced vs. Free Oscillations
- **Forced oscillations:** Rhythms caused by forces entering from outside the economic environment. Jevons theorized that solar changes affected agricultural production, which then cascaded through the whole economy.
- Garcia-Mata and Shaffner (Harvard, 1934) re-examined Jevons and found: sunspot phenomena showed no correlation with agricultural production, but remarkable correlation with industrial production, business activity, and stock market prices. Surprised by their own finding, they "threw up their hands and passed the problem over to the biologists and psychologists."
- Dr. H. T. Stetson confirmed that solar radiation data correlated with business activity and stock prices.
- **Free oscillations / "random shock" theory:** Rhythms generated internally by the economic system itself — like a rocking chair that, once pushed, oscillates at its natural frequency regardless of the push's character.
- E. Slutsky (1927, in Russian): *The Summation of Random Causes as the Source of Cyclic Processes* — argued that summation of random causes generates a cyclical series imitating a harmonic series of a small number of sine curves. After a considerable number of periods, regimes become disarranged and transition to another, sometimes gradually, sometimes abruptly at critical points.
- Modern mathematics can demonstrate the *possibility* that random shock accounts for economic rhythms — but there is still no final evidence that such shock actually *is* the underlying cause. It should not be rejected, but embracing it is still an act of faith.
- Two characteristics the random shock theory apparently fails to explain: (1) after distortion, rhythms snap back to their old established pattern; (2) it cannot account for the correspondence between so many economic and "natural" rhythms.

### Kondratieff's Rebuttal of Random Shock
- Kondratieff asserts that causes usually assumed for rhythms — wars, exploration, gold discoveries, innovations — "reverse the causal connections." Wars and revolutions are symptoms of the long waves, not causes. Gold production is subordinate to the rhythm. Innovations are part of it, not the trigger.
- Schumpeter, though admiring Kondratieff's work, prefers the random shock theory — believing innovations act as shocks that produce cyclic movement.

### Huntington's Three Types of Cycles
- Dr. Ellsworth Huntington of Yale (*Mainsprings of Civilization*): human life and civilization are influenced by three distinct but closely interlocking types of cycles:
  1. **Weather cycles** — most familiar; variations in heat/cold, rain/drought directly affect plants, animals, and humans.
  2. **Physiological/reproductive cycles** — especially evident in animals; the only known factor showing required periodicity is atmospheric ozone.
  3. **Psychological cycles** — primarily in humans; displays itself in business and prices. Associated with rhythms in atmospheric electricity, due presumably to the sun.
- All three types, due to heat, ultra-violet radiation, and electrical radiation, appear so intimately connected that they are often difficult to separate.

### Solar Radiation and Human Behavior
- Garcia-Mata and Shaffner (Harvard, 1934): sunspot phenomena showed no correlation with agricultural production, but remarkable correlation with industrial production, business activity, and stock market prices. "Surprised and aghast," they passed the problem to biologists and psychologists.
- Dr. H. T. Stetson (MIT): confirmed solar radiation data correlated with business activity and stock prices.
- Edgar Lawrence Smith: pH curve (acid-alkalinity ratio in blood) for 1938 closely coincided with stock market variations. Population tends to be "depressed and blue" when pH is low, "buoyant and optimistic" when pH is higher.
- Bernhard and Traute Düll (Germany): showed synchronization between solar eruptions and atmospheric electricity at Saint-Cyr (France) and Tunis (North Africa). Daily deaths from suicide, mental disorders, and diseases of the nerves ran almost parallel with the curve for magnetic disturbance. Similar patterns found in Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland.
- *Variability* in solar activity, more than area and number of sunspots, is the solar factor most promising for yielding a correlation.

### The Electromagnetic Wave Spectrum
- Earth is bombarded by an enormous range of electromagnetic waves — at least 25 "octaves" — from waves 5,000+ miles long to gamma rays a trillionth of a millimeter. Visible light occupies only about a single octave. Many of these unsensed waves affect us vitally.

### Anderson's Sunspot Harmonic Analysis
- C. N. Anderson (AT&T) performed harmonic analysis on 300 years of sunspot data (back to 1749), finding a fundamental long-term cycle of 312 years with a chief component rhythm of 22.28 years.
- The 22.28-year rhythm is of dominant importance — very close to rhythms found in many meteorological phenomena.
- Adjacent rhythms at 17.33 and 18.35 years — the 18.35-year sunspot rhythm is an almost perfect match for the 18⅓-year economic building cycle.
- Clustered around 9–10 years: rhythms at 8.91, 9.17, 9.45, 9.8, and 10.1 years — five such waves suggesting these may be solar counterparts of the 9-year economic rhythm.
- The 54-year economic cycle may correspond to an Anderson wave of ~52 years — or the 54 may be a multiple of the 9 or 18.
- **Key finding:** Turning points in prices generally *precede* corresponding turning points in the combined solar series.

### Tchijewski and Wheeler: Solar Rhythms and Civilization
- Tchijewski (Russia): increased electrical activity in the sun around sunspot maxima increases ionization of the air, stimulating mankind both physiologically and psychologically, with effects traceable throughout all social relationships.
- Dr. Raymond Holder Wheeler (University of Kansas): theory that heat radiation affects society and civilization, supported by exhaustive accumulation of historical data tending to confirm that solar rhythms of many lengths and amplitudes are connected with human rhythms showing up regularly through history.

### The Possible Postulate
- None of the data regarding the ultimate origin of rhythms is satisfying proof of anything. But they suggest we are at the gate of a new field of exciting knowledge.
- Possible postulate: our space is permeated by radiation from the sun — light waves, and many other forms. Different organisms on earth respond to (or are "blind" to) different wave lengths, just as a red pencil responds to "red" waves while a blue pencil responds to "blue" waves. Economic phenomena, biological phenomena, and solar phenomena may all be responding to the same radiative forces — producing correlated but not necessarily causally linked rhythms.

> "Man is a child of the earth, and by that same token a part of it, and for this reason he must also be a child of the sun."

### The "Y Waves" Postulate
- Suppose there are still longer waves in the universe — "Y waves" — with peaks 3½, 9, 18⅓, 54 years apart, and perhaps much farther spaced. These longer waves could directly or indirectly affect the sun, weather, animals, and humans — and different organisms might respond only to waves that "fit" their respective natures.
- This would explain how many different phenomena oscillate with rhythms of identical length, and how one set of phenomena fluctuates in waves entirely different from adjacent phenomena.
- Such conjectures completely outrun the facts in hand — but they might serve to explain what we observe.

### Eddington and the Limits of Knowledge
- Knowledge of ultimate cause, though an ultimate goal, is not immediately vital. As Eddington declared: "Scientific investigation does not lead to the knowledge of the intrinsic nature of things. Whenever we state the properties of a body in terms of physical quantities, we are imparting knowledge of the response of various metrical indicators to its presence, *and nothing more*."
- Whatever working hypothesis the reader prefers — free or forced oscillations — the analysis of rhythms is full of reward. As Dr. Willford I. King stated: if the oscillations follow some mathematical formula, the pattern of business must to a considerable extent be repetitive and hence predictable.

> "If the oscillations in business are dominated by forces following some mathematical formula... the pattern of business must to a considerable extent be repetitive in nature and hence predictable."

## Chapter XI: Analysis and Synthesis

### Waves as Probability, Not Material Reality
- When speaking of "waves" in the economy, these are mathematical references — not sensory ones. As Sir James Jeans identified the *wave* with *probability*: a "suicide wave" passing over London does not mean each person will commit suicide, only that the *likelihood* increases.
- The waves we talk about are mathematical records of energies — pay cuts, buying a car, self-denial, decisions — trillions of daily events that distribute themselves as curves through society.

### Normal Frequency Distribution
- Galton's Quincunx demonstrates the physical basis of the bell curve (normal frequency distribution) — shot falling through pegs into bins.
- Even "distortion" follows law: bearing balls of varying diameter follow the normal distribution in diameter but produce a skewed distribution in mass.

### Sound Synthesis as Analogy
- Two simple sound waves combined produce a complex wave (synthesis); any complex wave can be broken into its simple components (analysis). The same applies to economic data.
- An organ pipe curve can be decomposed into 12 harmonic components — and the graphic interpretation of the curve is really a mathematical equation (sum of sine functions).

### The Harmonic Method for Predicting Tides
- Sir William Thompson (1867) devised the harmonic method: a tidal curve is broken into constituent cosine curves, each attributable to a periodic cause (mainly astronomical).
- Any periodic motion can always be resolved into the sum of a series of simple harmonic motions (Fourier's Theorem, 1822).
- The number of constituents in a harmonic curve is *theoretically unlimited* — constituents are building blocks like jigsaw puzzle pieces. In practice, a finite number gives a useful approximation.
- For tides: principal lunar constituent M₂ (period 12.42 hours), principal solar S₂ (12 hours), lunar daily K₁, solar daily O₁, solar annual Sa, and others. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey uses 21 constituents for tide prediction.
- A tide-predicting machine sums 37 constituents in about 7 hours to make daily predictions for a year at a given point.

### Fourier's Theorem
- Any curve of wave length *l* can be reproduced by compounding simple harmonic curves of suitable amplitudes and phases, with wave lengths of l, ½l, ⅓l, and successive aliquot parts of l.
- For sound waves: usually fewer than 10 components needed, rarely as many as 30. For some arbitrary mathematical curves, exact reproduction requires an infinite series.

### Limitations of Harmonic Analysis for Economics
- Harmonic analysis fails by itself to give the true *length* of a rhythm — it ignores individual variation and changes in amplitude and phase shift.
- Multiple harmonic analysis gives a much closer approximation to the length.
- ~20 other methods of analysis are available: periodogram, Hoskins Time Chart, Moving Cycle Average, Periodic Table, electrical spectrum analysis.
- The Cyclograph — only two machines exist in the world (one in Chicago, one in Tucson, Arizona — owned by Andrew E. Douglass).

## Chapter XII: Timing a Business

### Every Business Has Its Own Rhythms
- Asking "what time it is on the clock" for a business is fundamentally a spatial question: "Where does this business stand in reference to its course of life?"
- Every business, wrapped around its trend, has rhythms that combine to make a path like an orbit. We can discover these rhythms by analysis, just as we discover constituent rhythms in tides.
- A business — major or minor — is an organ in the whole economy. It should contain at least one of the major rhythms found in the economy as a whole. In addition, it often has one or more rhythms seemingly unique to that particular business.

### Case Study: A Public Utility Company (1883–1939)
- **Step 1 — Sales chart (ratio scale):** Shows strong healthy growth, but the slope is flattening — the *rate* of growth is declining. The company is rapidly becoming mature.
- **Step 2 — Rate of change:** Calculate each month's sales as a percentage of the corresponding month 3 years prior. This reveals wide swings not visible in the raw sales chart.
- **Step 3 — Isolate regular cycles:** Two perfectly regular rhythms emerge — one of 18⅓ years (Cycle C) and one of 7½ years (Cycle B). They were concealed because their crests and troughs sometimes augmented and sometimes cancelled each other.
- **Step 4 — Synthesis:** Combine the two cycles (B + C = D). This composite, when compared with the actual rate-of-change curve, shows excellent conformity — especially close in the past 20 years (the period of maturity).
- **Step 5 — The trend line:** The trend of the rate of growth is decreasing (slopes steadily downward to the right on the percentage graph).
- **Step 6 — Complete synthesis:** Combine the trend line (E) with the two cycles (B + C) to get a total synthetic curve (F = B + C + E). Compare F with the original rate-of-change curve (G = A reproduced). The conformity is excellent overall, though some fluctuations in the actual curve have no counterparts in the synthesis.
- **Step 7 — Projection:** The synthesis of two waves (7½ and 18⅓ years) plus trend is projected 20 years into the future. This applies the same principle used to predict future tides — after constituents are isolated by analysis, the synthesis may be projected forward.
- The projection proved extremely close to the actual curve from 1939 through 1945. The two rhythms go back 57 years in the data and pretty well describe the series' behavior since maturity was reached.

### Practical Applications of the Projection
- The 1938–1939 chart showed plant expansion was reasonable at low cost; 1939–1946 refinancing should be favorable; surplus should be built up to maintain dividends in the coming decline.
- Hiring policy: 1944–1945 = no new vice-presidencies; 1945–1946 = slow hiring; 1947–1948 = employees may need to be weeded out.
- Real estate: In 1946 the city was in a great real estate boom — soaring rents, shortage of space. But the chart projected a great letdown before the forties ended. Those with long-term leases at high rents would have regrets.
- The 18⅓-year rhythm isolated in this utility company is the same one that shows up in real estate activity nationally — the rhythm Warren and Pearson called the next most important economic clock after price movements.

### War Does Not Alter the Rhythm's Timing
- When the 1941–1945 projection was drawn, it was not known those would be "war years." But sales rose during those years on the basis of the two rhythms alone. War may distort the *amplitude* of a wave (like a strong wind sweeping a high tide higher) but rarely interferes with the *timing*.
- Hazardous to read "reasons" into rhythmic patterns — around 1942 some observers said "the war is going to end!" based on the 1946 peak. Nothing in rhythm knowledge warrants such interpretation.

### Case Study: An Industrial Company (1871–1940)
- Sales plotted on ratio scale with 3-year moving average show a marked similarity to a typical major industry's trend line.
- Analysis reveals: a 9⅓-year wave (A), an 18⅓-year wave (B), and an underlying growth trend (D).
- WWI lifted the growth trend from one level to another — the pattern and rate of growth were not affected, the trend line merely continued at a somewhat higher level.
- Synthesis of A + B + D, projected to 1970, shows very close correspondence with actual data through 1940. After 1940, war forces lifted actual shipment figures above the synthesis line.

### Case Study: Another Industrial Corporation (1927–1941)
- Analysis of monthly sales (9-month moving average, adjusted for seasonal rhythm) reveals: a 41-month rhythm with a peculiar pattern; a 24-month rhythm; a 33-month rhythm; a 10-year rhythm; and a residual showing a further 15-month rhythm.
- Synthesis of all five rhythms projected to 1957 — the 10-year wave is conjectural (only two repetitions in the data, too short a history).
- Interesting: the corporation's U.S. sales peaked in 1930 (higher than 1929), reached another lesser peak in 1932 — its pattern clearly varies from the national economy.

### The Four Major Rhythms Diagrammed
- Figure 18: Approximate timing of the 54-year, 18⅓-year, 9-year, and 41-month rhythms in the American economy, projected from 1940 to 1980.
- These rhythms manifest progressively in various sorts of business organizations and price series. The approximate timing will not agree precisely with any particular series.
- **Key observation:** From 1947 onward, all four major rhythms are declining, and all four reach a bottom *circa* 1952, with the subsequent pattern calling for a concerted rise.

## Chapter XIII: Avoiding Some Economic Illusions

### The A Priori Prejudice Against Rhythms
- Many businessmen and economists find it hard to use trends and rhythms because of an *a priori* prejudice — they find it hard to believe human experience can be "determined" by factors outside man's conscious control.
- They accept weather as uncontrollable but resist the suggestion that changes in the social and economic climate may also be beyond the total rule of man's conscious will.
- A man accustomed to thinking that "causes" always produce "results" and that we control results by manipulating causes feels especially confused. If the price of gold doesn't "cause" the 1933 price rise (the rhythm was already due to rise), then what use is this rhythm business?

### Ouspensky's Two-Dimensional Being
- P. D. Ouspensky asked readers to imagine living in only two dimensions — a being infinitely thin, living on a tabletop, unable to look up/down or conceive thickness.
- In the center of the tabletop is a slot through which a multicolored wheel slowly revolves. The 2D being sees only a line of color changing along the table's edge — red to black to white to blue to red again.
- After observing long enough, the 2D being concludes "when red comes, it will eventually cause black; when black appears, it will eventually cause blue." He thinks he knows the *causes* of the phenomena.
- A three-dimensional scientist would admit he merely described *what happened*, without explaining it. But the 2D being, untrained in such fine distinctions, would boldly speak of "cause" followed by "effect."

### Time, Space, and Causality as Illusion
- The universe has more than three dimensions — call it "three-plus." In such a universe, if we think perception alone can tell us true causes, we shall err seriously.
- When a historical event occurs, we recognize a "cause" — but we never recognize cause *before* the effect. Our recognition of cause is always associated with *past* events viewed in retrospect.
- Minkowski (1905, following Einstein): electrical phenomena must be regarded as occurring in a continuum of four dimensions — three of space and one of time, welded together so closely that a joint could not be detected. *It is impossible to separate the space from the time in any absolute manner.*
- If time is relative, cause and effect are equally relative. If *Now* has no absolute meaning, neither can *Cause*.
- Ouspensky's psychological approach: time is the way we experience the unknown dimensions of space. The future is already "there" — like the landscape ahead of a soldier walking over a hill — and what we call "cause and effect" is merely our sequential perception of a spatial reality.
- Eddington: there is no absolute Now — only relative Nows differing according to different observers.

### The Law of Averages, Not Individual Prediction
- In economics, as in physics, we cannot predict what any given individual will do. But we do have useful methods for predicting what groups will do, within tolerable margins of error.
- We rely on statistics for large numbers of individuals, ignoring usual concepts of causality. An equation balanced in the future is just as valid as "2 + 2 = 4" is now.
- *All the successful predictions hitherto attributed to causality are traceable to this* — the law of averages governing vast numbers. Quantum laws for individuals are not incompatible with causality; they merely ignore it.
- Eddington: "Few things are more certain than the solvency of a life insurance company... The eclipse in 1999 is as safe as the balance of a life insurance company; the next quantum jump of an atom is as uncertain as your life and mine."

### Society as Organism, Not Sum of Individuals
- Economists who viewed society as a mere multiplication of individuals, and tried to describe it in terms of each individual's reason-why, were bound to fail.
- People banded together form a biological organism whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They are cells subject to mathematical laws controlling aggregates.
- The scientist who studies them is no more concerned with their individual concepts of reason-why than a scientist studying yeast cells is concerned with the possible thoughts of yeast cells. His only proper question is not *why* they act as they do, but *how* and *when*.

### The Illusion of Perception
- The famous two-faces/vase illusion (Ruben and Hartman): what you see depends on the focus of your attention. If our senses play such tricks in two dimensions, how much more so in three-plus dimensions?
- This is not nihilism — it is the essence of sound approach to knowledge. Only by knowing the limitations of our tools can we properly value results.

> "The outcome is itself sufficient justification of the method."

## Chapter XIV: War and Its Dislocations

### The Periodicity of War in China
- Dr. J. S. Lee's study, "The Periodic Recurrence of Internecine Wars in China" (1931), analyzed three 800-year epochs of Chinese history — the longest continuous historical record of any people.
- **First Epoch** (221 B.C.–A.D. 588): began with Ch'in dynasty unification; building of Great Wall; followed by centuries of peace then secession/rivalry between North and South, ending in northern invasion.
- **Second Epoch** (589–A.D. 1367): Grand Canal built under Sui emperor; same pattern of unification → prosperity → secession/rivalry → invasion.
- **Third Epoch** (A.D. 1368–present): Ming dynasty; Great Wall reconstructed, canals rebuilt, Peking built.
- Lee concluded the parallelism between these three periods "far exceeds the limits of probability" and is "perhaps too exact to be expected from the proceedings of human affairs."
- Spengler believed all cultures have a life course in the general order of 1,000 years and saw comparable phenomena emerging at parallel periods in each culture's life.

### War as Symptom, Not Cause
- Kondratieff argued that wars are *symptoms* of the long economic wave, not causes.
- The three great wars that created familiar wholesale price peaks all occurred when the 54-year rhythm was approaching its peak — War of 1812 (peak in 1817), Civil War (peak in 1871), and WWI (peak in 1925).
- WWII was fought wholly during a period of *decline* in the 54-year cycle — thus any upward price distortion during WWII was effected *against* the rhythmic tendency and was consequently *less* than it would otherwise have been.
- War does not change the *timing* of cycles — it may distort amplitude but the rhythm persists. Short rhythms continue to influence a series "on the back of" the war disturbance.
- **Key insight:** Once the war "explosion" has subsided, previously prevailing trends and levels have usually been re-established. *Previous wars did not, in themselves, alter basic underlying trends.*

### War's Effect on Income Distribution
- WWII caused an unprecedented redistribution of income. In 1939: 2 million families had income of no more than $200/year; 19 million at the bottom moved swiftly into middle-class incomes after 1941.
- Income taxes rose from under $1.5 billion to almost $20 billion in four years.
- Greatest increases in currency circulation occurred in the "poorer" districts — 520% increase in the Federal Reserve District of Atlanta (1939–1943) vs. 192% in Boston.

### Pareto's Law of Income Distribution
- Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) stated: in all places and at all times, the distribution of income in a *stable* economy follows the formula y = ax⁻ᵛ, where v is approximately 1.5.
- This means there will always be a given percentage of people in the top income bracket, in the bottom bracket, and in the middle — whether the community is rich or poor.
- The Pareto value of 1.5 represents stability; deviations signal social unrest. H.T. Davis correctly deduced that the 1935 Pareto index for France (1.85) predicted serious social disturbance. American conditions in 1932, reflected in a figure of 1.76, preceded revolutionary political, economic, and social changes.

### The National Debt Problem
- U.S. interest-bearing debt (plotted on ratio scale, 1830–1945) shows a concave upward trend — counter to all laws of growth, meaning it cannot continue permanently.
- Total indebtedness by early 1946 was estimated at $350 billion (double the 1930 prewar peak). Federal net debt went from 22% of total (1940) to 65% (1945).
- The debt charge, combined with possible deflation, could force radical changes in the economic system.

> "If we fix our minds upon the fact that the capacity to produce is the nation's wealth and upon the dislocation of that capacity as the supreme evil to be avoided, we shall, I believe, have hold of the saving truth."

## Chapter XV: Postwar Trends

### Five Key Trend Facts
1. The United States has achieved "maturity" — relative stability in fundamental aspects of life where once there was rapid growth.
2. Land area has been constant for many years; population still increasing but at a decreasing rate with the peak apparently just ahead; foreign trade seems past its peak.
3. Some indices (railroad mileage) have actually started down.
4. Manufacturing activity still increasing but at a decreasing rate. Basic industries like steel seem to be reaching their summit.
5. Depressions when the national trend shows "maturity" — even depressions that in earlier times would have seemed unimportant — will be felt deeply.

### Resource Depletion
- WWII reduced known natural oil supplies to unprecedentedly low levels. Iron and copper resources similarly reduced.
- Bernard M. Baruch: "The bedrock fact is that after this war the United States will face a struggle to remain the first power in the world. It will not be easy for America to hold that place."

### Declining Creative Capacity
- Dr. Pitirim A. Sorokin (Harvard): the rate of increase of discoveries and inventions definitely slowed down by the late 19th century; between WWI and 1920 even the absolute number declined; the climax in number and importance of exact science discoveries was reached not in the 20th century but in the 19th or 18th.
- U.S. patents issued (1837–1944) confirm the declining rate of growth on ratio scale.

### The Patent Commissioner's Mistake
- The patent commissioner who wrote in the 1880s that everything had been invented made just one mistake: he *reasoned* out what ought to happen instead of studying trends. "The reasons he selected as a basis for his conclusions — in a time when the trends were of course the reverse of today's — had a scope exceedingly limited in its resources."

### The Possibility of Revolutionary Change
- If the trends maturing in American basic industries stand for the life pattern of capitalism, the explosion of capitalism in our time means new trends are about to be born.
- But: new growth trends emerge *only* with revolutionary changes in environment — merely imposing a different economic system would not of itself suffice.
- Pearl's Drosophila bottle analogy: we Americans are reaching the upper asymptote of our curve. A few new gadgets by industry cannot change the relationships in our bottle. "We must have a whole new social bottle into which the American nation is going to move."
- The wartime birth rate leaping upward could signal a new trend, not merely a temporary wartime phenomenon.

### The Limits of Our Instruments
- Economic charts cannot by themselves answer all questions about the future. They are tools with a margin of error.
- Three fundamental assumptions: (1) a rhythm is significant only if repeated so many times it cannot be chance; (2) rhythms which have operated in the past continue to operate repetitively; (3) trends continue on their established courses.

## Chapter XVI: Postwar Rhythms

### Summary of Rhythm Findings
1. The underlying 54-year rhythm in wholesale prices is on the decline since 1925; due to reach bottom around 1952.
2. The shorter 9-year rhythm in wholesale prices, iron, steel, and stock prices — last high in 1937, reached another high in 1946 — due to turn down until 1951.
3. The 9-year rhythm was due to peak in 1946 or shortly after; the 3½-year pattern was forecasting a peak in 1947. Other peaks in the 3½-year rhythm due in 1950 and 1954. Lows due in '48 and '51.
4. The 18⅓-year rhythm in building activity reached its high about late 1942; building and real estate patterns due to decline to a low around 1953.
5. The 15-year pattern in the purchasing power of beef cattle prices was scheduled for a high around 1944, thereafter declining to a low due in 1951.

### No Lengthy Postwar Boom Expected
- The expectancies do not suggest any lengthy postwar boom. The number of important rhythms coming to a low together around 1952 suggests a growing postwar crisis.
- Government planning cannot be expected to prevent rhythmic depressions any more than planning by bankers and businessmen could. At best, government action would be ameliorative, not curative — "some kind of palliative action if the blows fall."

### Practical Advice for Individuals
- No individual can rely wholly on money saved to carry through future crises — governments have learned to demonetize money, restrict withdrawals, control exports, and delay bond payments.
- Real estate is no longer a perfect hedge for inflation, and in a time of deflation it may have questionable merits.
- Bonds are not a perfect refuge for savings. Stocks now mean the investor only participates in what is left after management takes its salaries and government seizes what it will.
- The foresighted individual will minimize dollar indebtedness — freedom from debt at least means freedom of action in time of emergency.

### The Steel Industry as Barometer
- Steel industry profits (1901–1945): average profit in the first half of the period was 4.95%, declining to 3.09% in the second half — a declining rate of profit symptomatic of a mature economy approaching zero growth rate.

### Timing the Postwar Downturn
- The 1929 stock market panic waited for a turn-down in the 9-year cycle, and followed the turn in the building activity cycle by 2–4 years.
- Data from the past suggested the real post-war break in the bull market of the forties could come any time after mid-1946 — after the 9-year pattern's turn-down. The break arrived on schedule in June 1946.
- If 1950–1953 looks like a subsequent deep valley on the charts, it is also the beginning of a long trend upward.

### The New 54-Year Cycle Beginning ~1952
- Schumpeter identified each 54-year cycle with a particular economic force — late 1700s = industrial revolution; next = steam/steel/railroads; latest = electricity/chemistry/motors.
- The new 54-year cycle beginning about 1952 may again be associated with some great change in living patterns — stemming from industrial or social developments now hardly visualized.
- After 1952, the upward sweep of various major periodicities suggests a time of important constructive accomplishments and prosperity, regardless of leveling trends in basic growth.

### Three Core Assumptions Restated
1. A rhythm can be considered significant only if it has repeated itself so many times and so regularly that it cannot reasonably be the result of chance.
2. The rhythms which have evidenced themselves clearly in the past continue to operate repetitively.
3. The trends which have been traced in our great basic industries continue on their established courses.

> "If the rhythms are ultimately confirmed by events, in their indications that the immediate postwar era will bring our economy into some economic hard sledding, we can take renewed hope in the very rhythm of the winter's coming. It will help confirm the knowledge we have gained that our economic rhythms do have patterns that can be projected — patterns that assure us that we shall also see, not too long hence, a new economic spring."

## Appendix I: The Ratio Scale

### Arithmetic vs. Ratio (Semi-Logarithmic) Scale
- On a ratio scale, equal vertical distances represent equal *percentage* changes (not equal absolute changes).
- A straight line on ratio scale = constant *rate* of growth. A bending-over line = declining rate of growth.
- The arithmetic scale gives little or no visual warning of a drastic fall-off in sales that lies immediately ahead — the ratio scale makes the deceleration visually obvious.
- On ratio scale, a cycle of 20% amplitude superimposed on a trend has equal absolute magnitude throughout — making visual and freehand projection much more likely to be fulfilled than projection on arithmetic scale.
- The interval from one number to a number ten times higher = a "cycle" on ratio scale. Looking at the vertical scale reveals how many tenfold increases the data spans.
- Charts in Chapters III, IV, and many others in the book are plotted on ratio scale.

---

## Appendix II: Moving Averages

### Simple Moving Average
- A flexible mathematical method of smoothing data, often used as a trend.
- 3-year moving average: sum three consecutive years, divide by three, post against the middle year. Repeat, advancing one year each time.
- For an even number of terms (e.g., 4-year moving average), exact centering is impossible — so a further 2-year moving average of the 4-year result is computed to achieve centering.
- In practice, 2-year moving totals of the 4-year moving totals are often taken and divided by eight.

### Effect of Moving Averages on Rhythms
- A moving average has no effect on the *period* or *length* of a rhythm in the underlying series — but it does affect *amplitude*.
- Any moving average with a length less than the period of the rhythm diminishes its amplitude.
- The more nearly the length of the moving average approaches the period of the rhythm, the more it removes it. When length = period, the rhythm is completely eliminated.
- Conversely, when computing *deviations* from a moving average, the length of the rhythm is unaffected regardless of the moving average length — though amplitude is very much affected.

---

## Appendix III: The Section Moving Average

### How It Works
- Unlike the simple moving average (which averages consecutive terms), the section moving average averages two or more consecutive *sections* or *cycles*.
- Example: for a 12-month seasonal cycle over 10 years of monthly data, take the first, second, and third Januarys and average them; then first, second, and third Februarys, etc. — producing the first 12-month section moving average (plotted at the middle of the span, year 2).
- Advance by one year: average the second, third, and fourth of each month — producing the next section. Continue until all possible consecutive groups have been averaged.

### Three Useful Properties
1. **Smoothing technique:** minimizes month-to-month irregularities by spreading distortions over three months rather than concentrating them in one.
2. **Length independence:** even if the section length chosen differs from the true cycle length, the *length* of the cycle disclosed in the resultant is unaffected — only the *amplitude* is dampened.
3. **Selective elimination:** when a series is simultaneously influenced by two rhythmic forces, a section moving average long enough will completely eliminate one rhythm (the one matching the section length) while leaving the other undisturbed — regardless of how close their lengths are.
