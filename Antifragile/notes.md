# Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder -- Detailed Notes

## Prologue: How to Love the Wind

- **Wind as metaphor**: Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes fire -- likewise with randomness, uncertainty, and chaos, you want to use them, not hide from them. You want to be the fire and wish for the wind
- The goal is not merely to survive uncertainty but to **dominate, domesticate, and conquer** the unseen, the opaque, and the inexplicable -- like a certain class of aggressive Roman Stoics who sought to have the last word

### The Antifragile Defined

- **Core definition**: Some things benefit from shocks -- they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, stressors, and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty
- There is no word for the exact opposite of fragile -- Taleb coins the term **antifragile**
- **Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness** -- the resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets *better*
- This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance, and even our own existence as a species
- **Antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex) and what is inert** -- like a stapler on your desk vs. the human body
- The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty -- crucially, a love of errors, a certain class of errors
- Things around us that like a measure of stressors and volatility: economic systems, your body, your nutrition (diabetes and many modern ailments seem associated with a lack of randomness in feeding), your psyche
- There are even **financial contracts that are antifragile** -- explicitly designed to benefit from market volatility

> "Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I'd rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time."

### Nonprediction

- By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic guide to **nonpredictive decision making** under uncertainty
- **Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable** (outside of casinos or the minds of people who call themselves "risk experts")
- This provides a solution to the **Black Swan problem** -- the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events. **Sensitivity to harm from volatility is tractable**, more so than forecasting the event that would cause the harm
- **Simple test of asymmetry**: Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile

### Deprivation of Antifragility

- **Critical insight**: Antifragility is the property of all natural (and complex) systems that have survived -- depriving these systems of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them; they will weaken, die, or blow up
- We have been **fragilizing the economy, our health, political life, education, almost everything** by suppressing randomness and volatility
- Much of our modern, structured world has been harming us with top-down policies -- dubbed **"Soviet-Harvard delusions"** in the book
- Just as spending a month in bed leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors
- **The tragedy of modernity**: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most
- Everything **top-down fragilizes** and blocks antifragility and growth; everything **bottom-up thrives** under the right amount of stress and disorder
- The process of discovery depends on **antifragile tinkering, aggressive risk bearing** rather than formal education

### Upside at the Expense of Others

- The largest fragilizer of society and greatest generator of crises: **absence of "skin in the game"**
- Some become antifragile at the expense of others by getting the upside from volatility and exposing others to the downside risks
- During the **2008 financial crisis**, blowup risks-to-others were easily concealed owing to the growing complexity of modern institutions
- The rise of a new class of **inverse heroes**: bureaucrats, bankers, academics with too much power and no real downside. At no point in history have so many **non-risk-takers** exerted so much control

> "The chief ethical rule is the following: Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others."

### The Antidote to the Black Swan

- **Black Swans** are large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence -- unpredicted by a certain observer (the "turkey")
- **Black Swans hijack our brains** -- we feel we "sort of" predicted them because they are retrospectively explainable (illusion of predictability). Life is more labyrinthine than shown in our memory -- our minds turn history into something smooth and linear
- **Complex systems** are full of interdependencies and nonlinear responses -- "nonlinear" means when you double the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect. Two weekends in Philadelphia are not twice as pleasant as a single one
- Man-made complex systems develop **cascades and runaway chains of reactions** that decrease predictability. The modern world may be increasing in technological knowledge but making things more unpredictable

> "You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness."

## Book I: The Antifragile -- An Introduction

### Chapter 1: Between Damocles and Hydra

- **The post office package thought experiment**: You stamp "fragile" on champagne glasses. What is the exact opposite? Not "robust" -- you would not need to write anything on a robust package. The opposite would be stamped **"please mishandle"** -- its contents would *benefit from shocks*
- **The fragile** is at best unharmed; **the robust** is at best and at worst unharmed; **the antifragile** is at worst unharmed
- There is no word for antifragility in any known language -- Taleb checked Indo-European languages, Semitic, Turkic families: absent from all

> "Half of life -- the interesting half of life -- we don't have a name for."

- **Three mythological figures on the spectrum**:
  - **Damocles** (fragile): The sword hanging by a horse-hair over the head -- it is only a matter of time. The danger will be silent, inexorable, and discontinuous -- falling abruptly after long periods of quiet. Sophistication brings fragility to Black Swans (Joseph Tainter)
  - **Phoenix** (robust): Destroyed and reborn from its own ashes, returning to initial state. Beirut has been destroyed and rebuilt eight times -- the earthquake of A.D. 551 buried the Roman law school, which was discovered as a bonus from history during reconstruction
  - **Hydra** (antifragile): Each time a head is cut off, two grow back. Harm is what it likes
- **Naming matters**: Just as ancient peoples had no word for "blue" (Homer's "wine-dark sea") yet could match colors perfectly, we are intellectually, not organically, antifragility-blind. Guy Deutscher's *Through the Language Glass* -- primitive populations without color vocabulary can still match strings to corresponding colors. William Gladstone discovered this limited ancient color vocabulary in the 1850s, in an impressive seventeen-hundred-page treatise on Homer

#### Proto-Antifragility

- **Mithridatism**: King Mithridates IV ingested sub-lethal doses of poison to build immunity. Got him in trouble later -- couldn't poison himself when needed and had to ask for a sword blow. Nero's mother Agrippina Mithridatized herself against poisons, eventually killed by assassins. Lesson: one cannot be robust against everything
- **Hormesis**: When a small dose of a harmful substance makes you *better off overall*. First scientifically described in 1888 by Hugo Schulz -- small doses of poison stimulate yeast growth. Plants' poisonous defense substances may stimulate our organisms. Caloric restriction activates healthy reactions and lengthens life expectancy
- **All hormesis seems to be doing is reestablishing the natural dosage** for food and hunger in humans -- hormesis is the norm, and its absence is what hurts us
- **Hormesis lost respect** after the 1930s due to mistaken association with homeopathy -- but the mechanisms are entirely different. Homeopathy has shown little empirical backing; hormesis has ample scientific evidence

#### Domain Independence Is Domain Dependent

- People understand an idea in one domain and fail to recognize it in another -- this is **domain dependence**
- **The Dubai banker**: Had a uniformed porter carry his luggage, then fifteen minutes later lifted kettlebells at the gym replicating suitcase-swinging
- A doctor recommends exercise to "get tougher" then prescribes antibiotics for a trivial infection
- Ask a U.S. citizen if a government agency should control car prices (outrage!) -- yet the **Federal Reserve** controls interest rates and Ron Paul was called a crank for suggesting its abolition
- Domain dependence is why it has been difficult for researchers to realize that uncertainty, incomplete understanding, disorder, and volatility are **members of the same close family**

---

### Chapter 2: Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere

- **Post-traumatic growth**: The opposite of post-traumatic stress -- people harmed by past events surpass themselves. Taleb had never heard of it before visiting David Halpern in London, despite having heard endlessly about PTSD. Popular culture knows it: "it builds character." Intellectuals focus on negative responses from randomness rather than positive ones

#### Innovation from Necessity

- **How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble** -- serious, but not terminal. The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!
- Latin: *artificia docuit fames* (sophistication is born of hunger). Ovid: *ingenium mala saepe movent* (difficulty wakes up genius). Brooklyn English: "When life gives you a lemon..."
- Note the disproportionate contribution of **uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs** to technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to Silicon Valley
- **Cato the Censor** worried about the weakening of the will from comfort -- an entire society can fall ill. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity: the world has never been richer, and never more heavily in debt
- **Automation hazard**: The automation of airplanes is underchallenging pilots, making flying too comfortable -- dangerously comfortable. The dulling of the pilot's attention from too little challenge is causing deaths from flying accidents. The FAA finally figured out that pilots often "abdicate too much responsibility to automated systems"

#### Overcompensation Everywhere

- **Best horses lose against slower ones** and win against better rivals -- undercompensation from the absence of challenge
- **Whispering, not shouting**: The most powerful traders were the least audible, like mafia dons. "Disfluency" activates more vigorous analytical brain machinery. Peter Drucker and Jacques Lacan mesmerized crowds while being the antithesis of polished speakers
- **Antifragile responses as redundancy**: Nature likes to overinsure -- two kidneys, extra spare parts, extra capacity. Human design is inversely redundant: we engage in debt, the opposite of redundancy. Overcompensation is just redundancy -- an additional Hydra head is no different from extra cash in the bank. **Redundancy is not defensive; it is more like investment than insurance**
- **The Lucretius problem**: The fool believes the tallest mountain equals the tallest he has observed. Pharaonic Egypt used the high-water mark of the Nile as worst-case estimate. Fukushima was built to withstand the worst *past* earthquake. Greenspan said "it never happened before." Nature, unlike Greenspan, prepares for what has **not** happened before -- your body is more imaginative about the future than you are

#### Riots, Love, and Other Beneficiaries of Stress

- **Seneca** in *De clemencia*: "Repeated punishment, while it crushes the hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of all... just as trees that have been trimmed throw out again countless branches"
- Political movements and rebellions can be **highly antifragile** -- the sucker game is to try to repress them using brute force
- One of the most antifragile things outside economic life is **obsessive love** -- a refractory passion that overreacts and overcompensates for impediments. In Proust's *La recherche*, Swann falls for Odette -- her elusive behavior fuels his obsession

> "The higher you build your barricades, the stronger we become." -- Irish revolutionary song

#### The Antifragility of Information

- **Information is antifragile** -- it feeds more on attempts to harm it than on efforts to promote it
- Banned books thrive: Graham Greene, Henry Miller, *Madame Bovary*, *Lady Chatterley's Lover*. The **Ayn Rand phenomenon**: read for over half a century by millions *thanks to* brutally nasty reviews
- **Criticism is an unfaked badge of attention** signaling a book is not boring
- Taleb's great-grandfather from his deathbed: "My son, I am very disappointed in you. I never hear anything wrong said about you. You have proven yourself incapable of generating envy."
- Those who dress outrageously are robust or antifragile in reputation; those in suits and ties are fragile to information. When you don't have debt, you don't care about your reputation -- **people lend the most to those who need them the least**

---

### Chapter 3: The Cat and the Washing Machine

- **Bold conjecture**: Everything that has life in it is to some extent antifragile. Your bones get denser under episodic stress (**Wolff's Law**, 1892). A dish or car may be robust but cannot be intrinsically antifragile
- **Aging is misunderstood**: Failures to self-repair come from maladjustment -- too few stressors or too little recovery. Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort. In a natural environment, people die without aging
- **Stressors are information**: Complex systems convey information through stressors -- your body gets information via hormones, not intelligence. Errors and their consequences are information; for small children, pain is the only risk management
- **Equilibrium means death**: For the nonorganic, equilibrium happens in inertia. For something organic, equilibrium only happens with death. A state of normalcy requires volatility and randomness (Ilya Prigogine's dissipative structures)
- **Touristification**: The systematic removal of uncertainty from things. What a tourist is to an adventurer, touristification is to life -- converting activities into the equivalent of a script. The guilty parties: education systems, planning, gym machines, electronic calendars
- **If I could predict what my day would exactly look like, I would feel a little bit dead**. Walking on uneven terrain means no two steps are identical, unlike the gym machine forcing endless identical repetitions. **Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury**
- One in ten Americans beyond high school is on some kind of antidepressant -- mood swings are a second source of intelligence. Had Prozac been available last century, Baudelaire's "spleen," Poe's moods, Sylvia Plath's poetry would have been silenced

---

### Chapter 4: What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger

- **Antifragility by layers**: The sacrifices of some fragile units are necessary for the well-being of the whole. The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile. **Restaurants** are individually fragile but collectively antifragile -- had they been individually robust, we'd get Soviet cafeteria food
- **Evolution and unpredictability**: Organisms need to die for nature to be antifragile. An immortal organism would need to predict the future perfectly. By letting organisms go one lifespan at a time with modifications, nature does not need to predict. **Every random event brings its own antidote** in the form of ecological variation
- **Autophagy**: When you drink a poisonous substance in small amounts, evolutionary processes *within* your system replace bad proteins with stronger, younger ones -- a purely evolutionary process that selects and kills the weakest for fitness
- **Aviation vs. banking**: Every plane crash makes the next flight safer -- aviation exploits small, independent errors. But every bank crash makes the next one more likely. The economic system produces contagion; aviation does not
- **National Entrepreneur Day**: Someone who did not find something provides the best knowledge -- that of absence. "Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking. *You are at the source of our antifragility.* Our nation thanks you."
- **Overconfidence can be benign**: Natural systems want some overconfidence on the part of individual economic agents -- local (not global) overconfidence is healthy for the economy. With bailouts, governments transfer fragility from the collective to the unfit

---

## Book II: Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility

- **Procrustes** was an inn-keeper in Greek mythology who cut the limbs of those too tall and stretched those too short to make travelers fit in his bed -- treating an organism like a simple machine is exactly like a Procrustean bed

### Chapter 5: The Souk and the Office Building

#### Two Types of Professions

- **John and George**: Identical twin brothers. John the bank clerk has perfectly predictable income -- monthly paycheck, gold watch every 25 years. Until banking crisis makes him "redundant" at fifty. George the taxi driver has extremely variable daily income but year after year averages the same. He has never had a single day without a fare in 25 years, is his own boss, and can continue into his eighties
- **The central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing -- and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness**
- For a self-employed person, a small mistake is information directing his adaptive approach; for an employee like John, a mistake goes into his permanent record
- **The more variability you observe in a system, the less Black Swan-prone it is**

#### Switzerland as the Most Antifragile Place

- The most stable country in the world **does not have a government** -- governed entirely bottom-up through cantons, near-sovereign mini-states. Bottom-up form of governance provides protection against the romanticism of utopias
- **"Stalin could not have existed in a municipality"** -- an administrator in a small environment cannot be shielded from the biological sting of shame for overspending. Eye contact with peers changes behavior
- Lobbyists cannot exist in a municipality -- centralization creates a larger payoff from lobbying at low cost
- Switzerland is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet has traditionally had very low university education -- based on **apprenticeship models, on techne (crafts), not episteme (book knowledge)**
- Bruno Leoni argued in favor of the robustness of judge-based law (owing to its diversity) as compared to explicit and rigid codified law

#### Mediocristan vs. Extremistan

- **Mediocristan**: Bottom-up volatility produces plenty of small variations that cancel out -- like the taxi driver's income. Fluctuates but does not sink
- **Extremistan**: Centralized or human-managed systems produce mostly stability with occasional catastrophic jumps -- like the employee's income. Moves from cascade to cascade
- **Caloric intake is Mediocristan** -- no single day represents more than 0.5% of yearly total. Financial matters are from Extremistan -- you can double your net worth or lose half in a single moment
- Human overintervention to smooth or control processes switches systems from Mediocristan into Extremistan -- **this effect applies to health, politics, economics, even someone's mood with and without Prozac**

#### The Great Turkey Problem

- A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms that butchers love turkeys "with increased statistical confidence." Then comes Thanksgiving
- The key: such a surprise is a **Black Swan event** -- but just for the turkey, not for the butcher
- **The mother of all harmful mistakes**: mistaking absence of evidence (of harm) for evidence of absence
- Our mission becomes **"how not to be a turkey"** -- figuring out the difference between true and manufactured stability

#### Twelve Thousand Years of the Northern Levant

- The area stayed perhaps the **most prosperous province in history** for twelve thousand years of continuity, dominated by traders on the Silk Road. Managed by local elites through decentralized ruling
- When the Baath Party centralized Syria, Aleppo went into **instant decline** -- trading families moved overnight to New York, California, and Beirut
- The Aleppine merchant who fled: "We people of Aleppo prefer war to prison" -- "prison" meaning loss of political and economic freedoms
- Despite civil war that decimated its population, today **Lebanon has three to six times the wealth of Syria**

> "It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues.... A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom." -- Rousseau, citing Machiavelli

- Before the nation-states of Germany and Italy, Europe was a mass of small statelings in constant but mild tension. The creation of nation-states led to two world wars: **more than sixty million victims**. A collection of statelings is like the restaurant business: volatile, but no generalized crisis. **Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated**
- People invoke "Balkanization" for fragmented states -- nobody uses **"Helvetization"** for their successes
- It is exactly like saying that **nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often** -- risk is in the future, not in the past

---

### Chapter 6: Tell Them I Love (Some) Randomness

#### Tight Controls Cause Blowups

- **James Clerk Maxwell** showed mathematically that tightly controlling the speed of steam engines leads to instability. Light control works; close control leads to overreaction
- In markets, fixing prices or eliminating "noise traders" provides an **illusion of stability** with calm punctuated by panics. When a currency never varies, a slight move makes people believe the world is ending -- **injecting some confusion stabilizes the system**
- The perfectly punctual man causes family anxiety if barely a few minutes late; someone with half-hour variation wouldn't cause such alarm

#### Variations as Purges

- **Small forest fires** periodically cleanse the system -- preventing them "to be safe" makes the big one much worse
- Stability is not good for the economy: hidden vulnerabilities accumulate during long calm periods. The longer without a market trauma, the worse the damage when it occurs
- A **"weak hand"** is someone fragile but doesn't know it, lulled by a false sense of security. When many weak hands rush to the door, they cause crashes. A volatile market prevents such buildup

#### Adding Randomness as Fuel

- **Buridan's Donkey**: Equally famished and thirsty, caught between food and water -- saved only by a random nudge. When systems are stuck, **randomness and only randomness can unlock them**
- **Stochastic resonance**: Adding random noise makes you hear weak signals *more accurately* -- not just psychological but a physical property. Weak SOS signals too weak for remote receptors become audible with background noise added
- **Annealing**: Heating and controlled cooling of metal. Heat causes atoms to wander randomly; cooling gives them more chances of finding better configurations. Mathematicians use **simulated annealing** for optimal solutions only randomness can deliver
- Taleb's father would tap a wooden **barometer** every day -- the stress got the needle unstuck and allowed it to find its true equilibrium position
- Chaotic balls jumping on a table from steady vibrations became orderly when **random, low-intensity shocks** were added. Order came not by removing chaos but by adding randomness
- **Political annealing**: Athenian assemblies chosen by lot. Alessandro Pluchino showed adding randomly selected politicians improves parliamentary function. For Voltaire, the best government was one tempered with political assassination -- regicide as tapping the barometer

#### That Time Bomb Called Stability

- Artificially suppressed volatility exhibits **no visible risks** while explosive material accumulates beneath the surface. The longer without the blowup, the worse the resulting harm
- **Egypt** before 2011 riots: supported by the U.S. for four decades "to avoid chaos" -- identical to "too big to fail"
- **Saudi Arabia**: A total monarchy with the royal family leading hedonistic lifestyles in contradiction to their purist legitimacy. Without the U.S., they would have had their revolution, some turmoil, then perhaps stability -- **but preventing noise makes the problem worse in the long run**
- Iran's theocratic regime is largely the result of U.S.-installed repression under the Shah. **We need to learn to think in second steps, chains of consequences, and side effects**

> "One of life's packages: no stability without volatility."

#### What Do We Call Modernity?

- **Modernity**: Humans' large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world's jaggedness, and stifling of volatility
- The spirit of **naive rationalism** -- the idea that society is understandable, hence must be designed, by humans. With it was born statistical theory, the bell curve, the notion of "efficiency"
- Consider the lion in the Bronx Zoo vs. his cousins in freedom -- we once had free-range humans and free-range children before the advent of the soccer mom
- Violence is transferred from individuals to states. So is financial indiscipline. At the center: the denial of antifragility
- **Modernity starts with the state monopoly on violence, and ends with the state's monopoly on fiscal irresponsibility**

---

### Chapter 7: Naive Intervention

- **The tonsillectomy study**: 389 children presented to NYC doctors; 174 recommended surgery. Remaining 215 shown to another group -- 99 recommended surgery. Each doctor recommends at roughly the same rate regardless of need. Every unnecessary operation shortens life expectancy
- **Iatrogenics**: Literally "caused by the healer." George Washington's death hastened by bloodletting (five to nine pounds of blood). Until penicillin, going to the doctor *increased* your chance of death. Leibniz called hospitals *seminaria mortis* (seedbeds of death). Medical error still kills between three and ten times as many people as car accidents in the U.S.
- **Ignaz Semmelweis**: Observed more women died in hospitals than on the street. Called establishment doctors criminals. Punished, humiliated, ended up in an asylum, died of the same hospital fever he warned against. **"The final lesson is that one should not expect laurels for bringing the truth."**
- **Generalized iatrogenics** should extend beyond medicine into political science, economics, education -- but not one consultant or academic recognized it when Taleb discussed it
- **The opposite of iatrogenics**: No designation exists for someone who helps while trying to cause harm. In Mel Brooks' *The Producers*, two fellows tried to produce the worst possible play (*Springtime for Hitler*) -- it was so bad it became a huge hit. Perhaps capitalism is an inverse-iatrogenic effect
- **Alan Greenspan**: "Top economic iatrogenist of all time" -- ironing out the boom-bust cycle caused risks to hide until they blew up the economy. Gordon Brown's mission to "eliminate" the business cycle led to the mother of all fragilities

#### Table: Fragilizing Interventionism Across Disciplines

| Field | Interventionism | Iatrogenic Cost |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Medicine/Health | Overtreatment; pharma addition not subtraction | Medical error; antibiotic-resistant bacteria |
| Ecology | Micromanaging forest fires | Larger "big ones" |
| Politics | Central planning; supporting rotten regimes | Chaos after revolution |
| Economics | "No More Boom and Bust"; optimization | Deeper crises; big-time blowups |
| Business | Positive advice (charlatans) | Bankrupt businesses |
| Urbanism | City planning | Urban blight, crime |
| Forecasting | Forecasting in Black Swan domain | Hidden risks (people take more risks) |
| Literature | Copy editors trying to change your text | Blander, commoditized writing |
| Parenting | Soccer mom: removing randomness | Touristification of children's minds |

- **Non-naive interventionism**: The argument is not against intervention but against naive intervention. Over-intervention comes with under-intervention -- we tend to **over-intervene where benefits are minimal** while **under-intervening where intervention is necessary** (emergencies). Intervening to limit *size*, *concentration*, and *speed* is beneficial
- **The Drachten experiment**: A Dutch town removed all street signs -- deregulation led to *increased* safety, confirming the antifragility of attention whetted by danger
- **A Legal Way to Kill People**: If you want to accelerate someone's death, give him a personal doctor. Michael Jackson's personal doctor was sued for overintervention. Why do very rich people with access to all medical care die just as easily as regular persons? It is *because* of overmedication

#### The Noise-to-Signal Ratio

- **The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you disproportionally get**:
  - Yearly: 50% signal, 50% noise
  - Daily: 5% signal, 95% noise
  - Hourly: 0.5% signal, 99.5% noise
- **Anyone who listens to news is one step below sucker**. Newspapers should be two lines on some days, two hundred pages on others. Too much data causes statistics to become meaningless -- like too much food confusing your biology
- Every day **6,200 persons die** in the U.S. from preventable causes, but the media only reports the most sensational, giving a distorted map of real risks

#### Procrastination as Defense

- **Fabius Maximus** ("the Procrastinator") drove Hannibal crazy by avoiding engagement. The Fabian Society named after him. Latin *festina lente* (make haste slowly). Lao Tzu's *wu-wei* (passive achievement)
- **Procrastination is our natural defense** -- letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility. Nature is less error-prone than scientists
- There is an element of **deceit associated with interventionism** -- easier to sell "Look what I did for you" than "Look what I avoided for you." The true hero in the Black Swan world **prevents a calamity** and gets no recognition for it
- **The Chinese famine** (1959-1961) that killed 30 million: researchers found that famine was *more severe* in areas with higher food production -- government food distribution policy was behind the problem
- **Soviet inefficiency as accidental robustness**: after the Soviet breakdown, calamities were avoided *because* food production was inefficient and full of unintentional redundancies. Every town had the staples growing around it

---

### Chapter 8: Prediction as a Child of Modernity

- In Korea, Taleb confronted a deputy managing director presenting economic projections: "Show us what you projected in the past!" Our track record in figuring out significant rare events is **not close to zero; it is zero**
- The idea of the **Triad** was born: Fragility-Robustness-Antifragility as a replacement for predictive methods
- **Forecasting is iatrogenic**: Danny Kahneman showed that providing someone with a random numerical forecast *increases his risk taking*, even when the person knows the projections are random
- **Redundancy is nonpredictive**: Extra cash in the bank plus cans of Spam and gold bars -- you don't need to know which event will cause difficulties. Those in debt need to predict with more accuracy
- After Fukushima, intelligent nuclear firms focus on **exposure to failure** -- small enough reactors, embedded deep enough, that failure is irrelevant
- After an event, switch blame from inability to see it coming to: **"Why did we build something so fragile?"** Not seeing a tsunami is excusable; building something fragile to them is not
- Making the world **greed-proof** is more intelligent than eliminating greed -- humanity has been trying for thousands of years and humans remain the same, "plus or minus bad teeth"
- The Swedish government's focus on total fiscal responsibility after their 1991 troubles makes them **less dependent on economic forecasts** -- allowing them to shrug off later crises

> "Randomness in the Black Swan domain is intractable. I will repeat it till I get hoarse. The limit is mathematical, period."

- The demarcation is as visible as the one between the cat and the washing machine -- social, economic, and cultural life lie in the Black Swan domain, physical life much less so
- Because of modernity, the share of **Extremistan is increasing** -- success for an author, a company, an idea, an athlete is **planetary, or nothing**. Our sophistication continuously puts us ahead of ourselves, creating things we are less and less capable of understanding

## Book III: A Nonpredictive View of the World

### Chapter 9: Fat Tony and the Fragilistas

- **Fat Tony and Nero** predicted a sucker's fragility crisis. Tony believed nerds, administrators, and bankers were the ultimate suckers -- collectively even bigger suckers than individually. He derived income from detecting suckers while leading a life of leisure
- Tony made a bundle from the crisis, high eight to low nine figures. Nero made less but was satisfied -- money to him could not be a social statement, only erudition and wisdom
- **Excess wealth as burden**: Beyond some level, wealth forces people into complications -- worrying whether the housekeeper is scamming them. Wealth was nonlinear
- Fat Tony did not believe in predictions but made big bucks **predicting that predictors would go bust**. Physicists from the Santa Fe Institute believed in fancy prediction models -- their ventures did not do well. Fat Tony, who did not believe in predictions, got rich from prediction
- **Fat Tony's model**: Identify fragilities, bet on collapse, collect big, have lunch. By betting against fragility, they were antifragile

> "Words are for sissies. A system based on verbal warnings will be dominated by non-risk-taking-babblers."

- **Dependence on external recognition** is health-eroding -- those who depend on words for serenity remain fragile to the emotional toll from compliments they did not get. Nero's "Fat Tony bet": opening the envelope with the spoils, curing himself of the recognition game
- Nero could stand near the former World Trade Center, across from colossal buildings housing banks and brokerage houses, all producing **noise**: wasted effort, cacophony, unaesthetic behavior. The large-scale delusion of "wealth" was bound to evaporate somehow

> "You learn more in a few lunches with Fat Tony than from the social science sections of the Harvard libraries, with close to two million books and research papers, for a total of 33 million hours of reading."

### Chapter 10: Seneca's Upside and Downside

- **Lucius Annaeus Seneca**: Philosopher who happened to be the wealthiest person in the Roman Empire (300 million denarii). Subscribed to Stoicism but focused on practical decision making. Described by academics as "not theoretical enough" -- yet none detected the ideas about asymmetry central to this book
- When Zeno of Kition lost everything in a shipwreck, he declared himself lucky: *nihil perditi* ("I lost nothing"). Stoicism makes you desire the challenge of a calamity

> "He is in debt, whether he borrowed from another person or from fortune."

- **The domestication of emotions**: Not elimination. The modern Stoic sage transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, desire into undertaking. A Roman Stoic would wait a day before beating a servant -- unlike Emperor Hadrian who irreversibly stabbed a slave's eye during uncontrolled anger
- Success brings an asymmetry: you now have **a lot more to lose than to gain** -- a rich person becomes trapped by belongings, stress hormones rising, sense of humor diminishing
- **Livy**: "Men feel the good less intensely than the bad" -- the ancients stay way ahead of modern psychologists on loss aversion

#### Seneca's Trick: Antifragility

- Wealth is the **slave of the wise man and master of the fool**. He kept the upside. His explicit "bookkeeping" in *De beneficiis*:

> "The bookkeeping of benefits is simple: it is all expenditure; if any one returns it, that is clear gain; if he does not return it, it is not lost, I gave it for the sake of giving."

- He **cut the downside and kept the upside** -- that is antifragility in its purest form
- If previous Stoics claimed to prefer poverty to wealth, we need to be suspicious -- since most were poor, they might have fit a narrative to the circumstances (the notion of **sour grapes**). Seneca was all deeds -- he kept the wealth

#### The Foundational Asymmetry

> *Fragility implies more to lose than to gain, equals more downside than upside, equals unfavorable asymmetry*
> *Antifragility implies more to gain than to lose, equals more upside than downside, equals favorable asymmetry*

- You are antifragile for a source of volatility if potential gains exceed potential losses. If you have more upside than downside, you may be **harmed by lack of volatility**

### Chapter 11: Never Marry the Rock Star

- **The barbell (bimodal) strategy**: A combination of extremes kept separate, with avoidance of the middle. Not necessarily symmetric -- just two distinct modes
- **Extreme risk aversion on one side, extreme risk loving on the other**, rather than the "moderate" risk attitude that is a sucker game (medium risks are subject to huge measurement errors)
- **In finance**: 90% in boring cash, 10% in maximally risky securities. Maximum known loss. Someone with 100% in "medium" risk has a risk of total ruin from miscomputed risks
- **Biological barbells**: Females in monogamous species marry the accountant (stability) and cheat with the rock star (genetic upside) -- timing corresponds to periods of high likelihood of pregnancy. More than a tenth of broods in "monogamous" birds come from males other than the putative father
- **In literature**: French writers seek sinecures (civil servant jobs) then write freely. American writers become academics, which makes them prisoners of a system

> "Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself." -- Yiddish proverb

- **Path dependence**: Fragility has a ratchet-like property -- damage is irreversible. Speed and growth are empty without accounting for fragility. GDP growth via debt loading is not growth. During the Industrial Revolution, growth was less than 1% per head -- but it was **robust growth**, unlike the current fools' race
- **The strong logical precedence of survival over success**: to make profits and buy a BMW, it would be a good idea to, first, survive

---

## Book IV: Optionality, Technology, and the Intelligence of Antifragility

### Chapter 12: Thales' Sweet Grapes

- **The teleological fallacy**: The illusion that you know exactly where you are going -- almost all important innovations came from serendipity and tinkering, not directed research
- **The rational flaneur**: Someone who, unlike a tourist, revises his schedule at every step based on new information. Steve Jobs was a rational flaneur, distrusting market research. Business plans are dangerous because they lock you into a fixed narrative
- **America's principal asset**: Not resources or education but risk taking and optionality -- the culture of trial-and-error with no shame in failing
- **Thales of Miletus**: Put a deposit on olive presses before harvest -- the first option contract. Limited loss (small deposit), large possible gain (controlling presses). Aristotle missed the financial insight entirely, thinking it was about philosophers proving they could be rich
- **Options = asymmetry + rationality**: The right but not the obligation. You need the rationality to recognize a good outcome and keep it. Options benefit from volatility -- exactly like antifragile systems
- **Sweet grapes vs. sour grapes**: Thales genuinely chose philosophy over wealth, having proven he could be rich. His poverty was choice from strength, not weakness
- **Embedded options in daily life**: Saturday evening in London -- small downside (taxi ride), big upside (might meet someone wonderful). Rent-controlled apartment: uncertainty *increases* the value of the option. Hidden options tend to be underpriced or free because people don't recognize them
- **Optionality is a substitute for intelligence**: Evolution produces sophisticated objects without intelligence, through optionality plus a selection filter plus randomness. "Stay hungry, stay foolish" probably meant: be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it
- **Life is long gamma** -- Rabbi Anthony Glickman's dictum. In trader jargon, "long gamma" means benefits from nonlinearity of options, benefits from volatility. The largest generators of wealth in America: real estate and technology -- both relying on optionality. Banks have negative optionality -- they lose periodically every penny made in their history thanks to blowups

> "Growth in society may not come from raising the average, but from increasing the number of people in the 'tails' -- that small, very small number of risk takers crazy enough to have ideas of their own."

### Chapter 13: Lecturing Birds on How to Fly

- **The wheeled suitcase**: Six thousand years between the invention of the wheel and putting wheels on suitcases -- three decades after we put a man on the moon. The Mesoamericans had wheels on small toys but never applied them for transportation
- **The Soviet-Harvard Department of Ornithology**: Imagine professors lecturing birds on flight. The bird flies. They claim the bird obeyed them. The Harvard Department of Ornithology is now "indispensable." Birds write no papers, so we never get their side
- **Epiphenomena**: The compass on a bridge appears to direct the ship rather than reflect its direction. We see high research in wealthy countries and conclude research generates wealth. Greed is an epiphenomenon; the real cause is the **system's fragility**
- **The real innovation loop**: Random Tinkering (antifragile) --> Heuristics (technology) --> Practice and Apprenticeship --> Random Tinkering. Academic theories run in parallel with rare accidental leaks, overhyped and grossly generalized
- Most texts define technology as "the application of scientific knowledge to practical projects" -- this leads us to believe knowledge flows from lofty science to lowly practice. **The reality is largely the reverse**
- The **translational gap**: The time between formal discovery and first implementation is lengthening. Two centuries between discovery of germs and acceptance as cause of disease; sixty years between antisepsis and drug therapy

### Chapter 14: When Two Things Are Not the "Same Thing"

- **The green lumber fallacy**: Joe Siegel, one of the most successful lumber traders, thought "green lumber" was lumber painted green (it's freshly cut). He made his profession to trade it. The narrator with grand theories went bust. **People we call ignorant might not be ignorant**
- **Fat Tony and Kuwait (1991)**: Every analyst predicted oil would rise with war. Tony bet against it -- prices had already adjusted. "It has to be 'in the price.'" Oil collapsed from $39 to almost half. Fund managers with elaborate war-room analysis knew everything except it had **nothing to do with oil** -- "not the same ting"
- **Jim Simons** (Renaissance Technologies): Never hires economists, only physicists and mathematicians doing pattern recognition. Never listens to economists
- **Ariel Rubinstein** tried applying game theory to a Levantine souk vendor. The vendor: "For generations, we have bargained in our way and you come and try to change it?"
- **Heuristic knowledge**: An idea survives not because it is better than the competition but because **the person who holds it has survived**. Grandmother's wisdom should be empirically superior to business school knowledge
- **The sucker-nonsucker distinction**: Exposure is more important than knowledge. We check for weapons at airports not because we believe passengers are terrorists, but because we are **fragile to terrorism**. You decide principally based on fragility, not probability

### Chapter 15: History Written by the Losers

- **Misattributed innovations across domains**: Jet engines attributed to physicists (actually tinkering engineers -- busted by Scranton); Architecture attributed to geometry (actually heuristics and guild recipes); Derivatives to Black-Scholes-Merton (actually traders a century before -- busted by Haug and Taleb); Industrial Revolution to Scientific Revolution (actually adventurers and hobbyists -- busted by Kealey)
- **Options pricing**: Traders had sophistication *at least a century* before academics claimed to derive it. "We don't put theories into practice. We create theories out of practice."
- **Architecture without math**: Before the thirteenth century, no more than five persons in Europe could perform division. Yet cathedrals still stand. Romans built aqueducts without mathematics (Roman numerals don't allow quantitative analysis)
- **The Industrial Revolution**: The steam engine emerged from preexisting technology, created by uneducated, isolated men. Two main sources of innovation: the **hobbyist** and the **English rector** (both in barbell situations). English parish priests with comfortable houses: Rev. Cartwright (power loom), Rev. Jack Russell (bred the terrier), Rev. Buckland (first dinosaur authority)
- **Medicine**: Nixon's "war on cancer" screened 144,000 plant extracts -- not a single approved drug. Vinca Alkaloids discovered by chance. Chemotherapy came from mustard gas (WWII). The increase in theoretical understanding came with a *decrease* in new drugs
- **The 1/N strategy**: If you face *n* options, invest equally in all. In Extremistan with power-law payoffs, "the payoff can be so large that you can't afford not to be in everything"
- **The inverse turkey problem**: For the antifragile, the sample track record *underestimates* the long-term average. Gary Pisano (Harvard) concluded biotech had pitiful potential because "most firms earn no profit" -- classic inverse-turkey mistake in Extremistan
- **Corporate drift**: Coca-Cola began as a pharmaceutical product. Tiffany started as a stationery store. Raytheon was a refrigerator maker. Nokia was a paper mill. DuPont started as an explosives company. Avon began in door-to-door book sales

### Chapters 16-17: A Lesson in Disorder / Fat Tony Debates Socrates

- **The touristification of the soccer mom**: E. O. Wilson -- the biggest hindrance to child development is eliminating trial and error, antifragility, and the ecological from children's lives
- **Only the autodidacts are free**: Lions in captivity live longer but they are not lions. Taleb was a barbell autodidact: minimal study for exams, 30-60 hours/week of self-directed reading. "The trick is to be bored with a specific book, not with reading itself. Trial and error is freedom"
- **"Much of what other people know isn't worth knowing."** The treasure lies outside the corpus, as far from the center as possible
- Good grades carry side effects -- they correspond to intellectual sacrifice. The person at the exact bottom of his father's class turned out to be the most successful (self-made merchant with a huge yacht)

> "We do not study for life, but only for the lecture room." -- Seneca

- **Fat Tony vs. Socrates**: "Does a child need to define mother's milk to understand the need to drink it?" Fat Tony never lets the other person frame the question. "If I asked someone riding a bicycle to give me the theory behind his bicycle riding, he would fall from it. By bullying and questioning people you confuse them and hurt them."
- Fat Tony's verdict on Socrates: "You are destroying people's illusions about themselves. You are taking the joy of ignorance out of the things we don't understand. And you have *no* answer; you have *no* answer to offer them."
- **Nietzsche's insight**: "What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent? Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled?" -- perhaps the most potent sentence in his century. Nietzsche figured out antifragility: the Dionysian (dark, visceral, untamed) and the Apollonian (measured, rational) must be balanced. Stochastic tinkering (Dionysian) is the source; the Apollonian is part of the selection process
- **Tradition and its critics**: Edmund Burke countered the French Revolution for disrupting the "collected reasons of the ages." Michael Oakeshott believed traditions provide filtered collective knowledge. Hayek opposed social planning but missed optionality as a substitute for the social planner. Wittgenstein's insight into the inexpressible -- the green lumber issue

## Book V: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear

### Chapter 18: On the Difference Between a Large Stone and a Thousand Pebbles

- **The king's stone** (rabbinical literature): A king swore to crush his son with a large stone. His sage: cut it into pebbles. The difference illustrates how **fragility stems from nonlinear effects**
- **Nonlinear harm examples**: Driving into a wall at 50 mph > 10x the harm of 5 mph. Seven bottles of wine at once > seven days of one bottle each. Jumping from 30 feet > 10x worse than 3 feet (30 feet is the cutoff for death from free fall)
- **Why fragility is nonlinear**: If one-millimeter jumps caused linear fraction of 30-foot damage, we'd already be dead from walking. There are millions of microearthquakes daily, totally harmless; but quakes of intensity 6+ make the newspapers
- **Traffic is highly nonlinear**: Add cars progressively with minimal impact, then a 10% increase causes 50% more travel time. Every additional car increases travel time more than the previous one. Central banks can print money with no effect, then "unexpectedly" inflation jumps
- **Squeezes and size**: Societe Generale's $70 billion fire sale lost $6 billion; ten smaller banks with proportional rogue traders would have lost close to nothing. Mergers show no gain from increase in size. **Jared Diamond's "Why Cats Have Nine Lives"**: throw a cat from several times its height -- it survives; elephants break limbs easily
- **Projects**: Bent Flyvbjerg showed cost overruns increase with size for monolithic projects (bridges, tunnels) but not for roads (built in small segments). The **planning fallacy is not psychological** -- it is inherent to nonlinear structure. Time cannot be negative, so errors only add to the right end. The Iraq war: from $30-60 billion estimated to over $2 trillion
- **The Crystal Palace vs. modern projects**: Many large-scale projects a century and a half ago were completed on time -- the Empire State Building, the Crystal Palace (concept to opening in nine months, no computers, no business schools). Today's world has more nonlinearities, asymmetries, interdependencies
- **Black Swan effects are necessarily increasing** from complexity, interdependence, globalization, and "efficiency." The world is getting less predictable while we rely more on technologies with harder-to-estimate errors
- **Pollution and size**: Fossil fuels are harmful nonlinearly -- a little is devoid of harm, a lot can cause climatic disturbances. Split your sources of pollution among many natural sources -- the harm from ten different sources is smaller than equivalent pollution from a single source
- **NYC traffic anecdote**: Authorities authorized a film company to use the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge, assuming minimal impact on a Saturday. Minutes became hours -- NYC authorities simply **did not understand nonlinearities**
- **Run, Don't Walk**: Two brothers travel a mile -- one walks steadily, one plays with his device for 14 minutes then sprints for 6. Same distance, same time, but the sprinter gets more health benefits. **Health benefits are convex to speed**. The very idea of exercise is just exploitation of convexity effects

### Chapter 19: The Philosopher's Stone and Its Inverse

- **Fannie Mae's secret risk reports** (2003): A move upward in economic variables led to massive losses; a move downward led to small profits. Acceleration of harm was monstrous. Their blowup was inevitable: exposures were severely concave. Taleb kept telling anyone who would listen, including taxi drivers, that Fannie Mae was "sitting on a barrel of dynamite"
- **The grandmother example**: Average of 70F is meaningless if the first hour is 0F and the second is 140F. **The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations** -- the dispersion matters more
- **Jensen's inequality and the philosopher's stone**: For a convex function (squaring), the average of the function (15.17) exceeds the function of the average (12.25) -- a 24% "edge." This is the **hidden benefit of antifragility** -- you can guess worse than random and still outperform. For the concave, you need to be much better than random just to survive
- **Government deficits are particularly concave** to changes in economic conditions. Financial leverage has the same effect -- a Ponzi scheme structure
- **Small probabilities are incomputable**: They are convex to errors of computation. A 5% error in standard deviation raises a "three sigma" probability by 60%. For "ten sigma" events, the difference is more than **a billion times**. This explains Fukushima and Fannie Mae
- The fragility detection heuristic: check for **acceleration of harm** -- if a 10,000-car increase adds 10 minutes of travel time, but 10,000 more cars add 30 minutes, that acceleration shows fragility

## Book VI: Via Negativa

### Chapter 20: Via Negativa, the Lindy Effect, and Neomania

#### The Apophatic Method

- Focus on what something is *not* rather than what it is. **Pseudo-Dionysos the Areopagite** and the negative way. Proclus: statues are carved by subtraction

> *Michelangelo was asked about the secret of his genius. "It's simple. I just remove everything that is not David."*

- **The interventionist** focuses on positive action; the pros focus on *not* doing. Chess grandmasters win by **not losing**; people get rich by **not going bust**; religions are mostly about **interdicts**
- **Charlatans give you only positive advice** -- "Ten Steps for..." The negative is what works. **Subtractive knowledge** is more robust: we know a lot more what is wrong than what is right. What we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right
- Knowledge grows by subtraction much more than by addition -- disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation

> "As Paul Valery once wrote: how many things one should disregard in order to act."

- **Less is more in decisions**: If you have more than one reason to do something, just don't do it -- by invoking more than one you are trying to convince yourself. Obvious decisions require a single reason. The French army rejected excuses with more than one reason for absenteeism
- **Bergson's razor**: A philosopher should be known for one single idea. Einstein: "I never have ideas" -- he just did not have trivial ideas
- **Steve Jobs**: "Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things."

#### The Lindy Effect

- For the **perishable**, every additional day translates into shorter additional life expectancy. For the **nonperishable**, every additional day implies longer life expectancy
- A book in print for forty years: expect another forty. If it survives another decade, then fifty more. Things that have been around for a long time are "aging" in reverse -- every year without extinction doubles additional life expectancy
- Richard Gott tested with Broadway shows -- 95% accuracy. The Great Pyramid (5,700 years old) vs. the Berlin Wall (12 years old)
- **Reading rule**: "As little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books not about the last fifty years." Teach children the classics -- the future is in the past

> *He who does not have a past has no future.* -- Arabic proverb

- **Prophets and the present**: The classical role of the prophet is not to look into the future but to talk about the present -- warning, not predicting. By issuing warnings based on vulnerability (subtractive prophecy), we are closer to the original role
- Being a Levantine prophet has not been a desirable occupation -- Jeremiah was beaten, persecuted, stoned. Jesus mentioned "no one becomes a prophet in his own land." Cassandra received the gift of prophecy along with the curse of not being believed

#### Neomania and the Constancy of Technology

- Imagine the future and your imagination *adds* things. The correct approach: **take away** from the future. What is fragile will break
- Tonight's dinner: silverware (Mesopotamian), wine (six millennia), glasses (2,900 years), chairs (3,000 years), fire. We produce 2.5x as many bicycles as cars. The most consequential technology: the condom -- designed to be less and less noticeable
- **Technology at its best is invisible** -- displacing the deleterious. Barefoot shoes reverse decades of "engineered" footwear. The tablet returns us to Babylonian roots of writing on tablets
- **Treadmill effects**: We rapidly tire of what we have, hunting for 2.0. The oil painting stays; the flat-screen TV will be donated. Items with an on-off switch tend to be neomaniac; artisanal items have antifragility
- **Architecture**: Jane Jacobs fought Robert Moses to save the West Village. The most expensive Paris neighborhoods were left alone by renovators. Gaudi's naturalistic buildings inspired by nature; later modernism is smooth and stripped of fractal jaggedness. Le Corbusier's "machines for living" became "machines for alienation"
- **Empedocles' Dog**: A dog prefers to always sleep on the same tile -- there is a natural, biological match. Human technologies that have survived are like the tile -- a match between natural friends. If something that makes no sense to you has been around for a very long time, expect it to stick around much longer
- **Futuristic projections fail**: In 2010, *The Economist* asked Taleb to imagine 2036. He predicted wall-to-wall bookshelves, the telephone, artisans. Corporations large today should be gone -- size is the enemy. City-states and small corporations more likely to thrive. The nation-state will have powers severely eroded

### Chapters 21-22: Medicine, Convexity, and Opacity / To Live Long

- **Via negativa decision rule**: Only resort to medical techniques when the payoff is very large and visibly exceeds potential harm. Otherwise, large sucker problem
- **"Do you have evidence" fallacy**: Mistaking evidence of no harm for no evidence of harm. The non-natural needs to prove its benefits, not the natural. Only time is evidence
- **Second principle of iatrogenics**: Benefits are **convex to condition**. For mild hypertension, 1 in 18 benefits from treatment. For severe, 72%. Focus on high-symptom conditions; ignore others
- **Trans fat**: Humans assumed they could make fat better than nature. Widely propagated, now widely banned as it causes heart disease. **Thalidomide**: small benefit (reducing nausea), delayed harm (birth defects). Benefits obvious and immediate; harm delayed for years
- **Lung ventilators**: Constant pressure was standard. But dispensing higher pressure on occasion and low pressure at other times decreased mortality -- humans are antifragile to lung pressure. An occasional spike helps open collapsed alveoli -- that's how lungs function naturally, with variations and "noise"
- **Life expectancy gains** came from sanitation, penicillin, crime reduction -- not routine treatment. **Hospital strikes** show life expectancy doesn't drop when only urgent cases are treated
- **Via negativa health**: Remove painkillers, vitamin pills, supplements. "Drink nothing that isn't at least a thousand years old -- wine, water, coffee." Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.: "if all the medications were dumped in the sea, it would be better for mankind but worse for the fishes"
- **Religion and fasting**: Greek Orthodox church has ~200 fasting days per year. The Cretan diet's longevity may owe more to variations in intake via fasting than specific foods consumed. The second-order effect (variations) could be dominant -- something mechanistic researchers missed
- **Autophagy**: When deprived of food, cells eat themselves, replacing weak proteins. Valter Longo found mice in initial starvation phases withstand high doses of chemotherapy without side effects. Prisoners in concentration camps got less sick in the first phase of food restriction
- **Breakfast is harmful**: No benefits unless you worked for it first. In nature, lions hunt to eat, not eat then hunt for pleasure
- **The omnivore's nonlinearity**: Humans are omnivorous in response to variegated environments. Herbivores eat steadily; predators eat randomly. Proteins need to be consumed randomly for statistical reasons. Getting three times the daily dose of protein in one day and nothing the next two is not biologically equivalent to steady consumption
- **Surgery has a better track record than medicine**: checked by the necessary rigor of visible results. Surgeons were blue-collar workers, closer to artisans -- they didn't feel obligated to theorize. Surgeons' guilds were merged with those of barbers
- **Antibiotics**: Every time you take one, you help mutation of germs into antibiotic-resistant strains. You transfer the antifragility from your body to the germ. The solution: only when benefits are large
- **Statins**: One needs to treat fifty high-risk persons for five years to avoid a single cardiovascular event. They certainly lower cholesterol, but your objective function is not to lower a metric but to get in better health. It is not certain whether these indicators are **causes or manifestations** -- muzzling a baby would prevent him from crying but would not remove the cause of his emotions

> Seneca: "To a sick person, honey tastes better."

- **The iatrogenics of money**: We have never been richer and never more in debt. The **Tantalus class**: permanently tantalized, socialized into expensive milieus, exposed to treadmills. You move to Greenwich, Connecticut, then become a pauper next to twenty-million-dollar mansions
- **The gene is antifragile** (information), but the carrier is fragile. Nietzsche: *aut liberi, aut libri* -- either children or books
- **Conditional life expectancy**: In the last 50 years, only four months have been added to the expected life span of a person already 60 years old -- most gains come from severe cases, not routine treatment
- **I Want to Live Forever**: For the ancients, the worst possible outcome was not death but a dishonorable death. The modern illusion that we should live as long as we can -- as if each individual were the end product. Before that, we were part of the present collective and future progeny. People engaged in sacrifices, sought martyrdom, died for the group. The "singularity" thinkers like Ray Kurzweil, popping close to two hundred pills daily, represent Taleb's anti-me

---

## Book VII: The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility

### Chapter 23: Skin in the Game

- **The disappearance of heroism**: Power goes to bankers, executives, and politicians who steal a free option from society. **Heroism** is the exact inverse of the agency problem: someone accepts deprivation for the sake of others
- **Hammurabi's code** (~3,800 years ago): If a builder's house collapses and kills the owner, the builder is put to death. The builder knows more about hidden foundations than any inspector -- **the best risk management rule ever**. The foundation, with delayed collapse, is the best place to hide risk. They were much more advanced 3,800 years ago than we are today
- **Fat Tony's heuristics**: (1) Never get on a plane if the pilot is not on board. (2) Make sure there is a copilot. **Ralph Nader's rule**: People voting for war need at least one descendant exposed to combat
- Romans had engineers **spend time under the bridge they built**. The English went further, having families join them

#### Courage and Its Evolution

- Heroism evolved: from **physical courage** (Homeric) to **sacrifice for the collective** (Spartan -- Agiselaus: a happy life is one crowned by death in battle) to **dying for truth** (Socratic-Platonic -- the highest form of honor)
- Taleb's father's courage: When insulted by a militiaman during the Lebanese war, he refused to comply. Shot in the back; the bullet stayed in his chest for the rest of his life. **Dignity is worth nothing unless you earn it**
- **Megalopsychon** (Arabic: *Shhm*) -- "nonsmall": If you take risks and face fate with dignity, nothing you do makes you small; if you don't take risks, nothing makes you grand
- **Half-man**: Not someone who does not have an opinion, just someone who does not take risks for it. Paul Veyne showed gladiators were mostly volunteers who wanted the chance to become heroes

> If you see fraud and don't say fraud, you are a fraud.

#### The Stock Market as Transfer of Antifragility

- Corporate managers have **incentives without disincentives**. The stock market has cost retirees over $3 trillion while managers got $400 billion in compensation. Volatility benefits managers; society has the exact opposite payoff
- **Robert Rubin's free option**: Earned $120 million from Citibank; when it collapsed, he kept his money. Taxpayers compensated him retrospectively. Thousands of executives had the same payoff
- **Adam Smith** was extremely wary: "The directors of such companies, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance"
- **Hammurabi's rule and historical punishments**: The tradition in Catalonia was to behead bankers in front of their own banks. In modern times, only the mafia executes these strategies -- "Vatican banker" Roberto Calvi ran to London after his bank went bust; the mafia killed him for losing their money

#### Corporations vs. Artisans

- While corporations sell junk drinks, artisans sell cheese and wine. Pharmaceutical companies don't gain if you avoid sugar. All firms must produce "growth in revenues" to satisfy some MBA analyst -- they will eventually self-destruct
- **Anything that requires heavy marketing is either inferior or evil**. There is no product Taleb particularly likes that he discovered through advertising. **Word of mouth is the only naturalistic filter**
- **Lawrence of Arabia or Meyer Lansky**: If you must choose between a mobster's promise and a civil servant's, go with the mobster. Institutions don't have honor; individuals do. A handshake from Meyer Lansky was worth more than the strongest contracts a battery of lawyers could produce
- Lawrence struck a deal with Arab tribes to fight for the British, but the Sykes-Picot Agreement secretly divided the area -- **never trust the words of a man who is not free**

> Only a sense of honor can lead to commerce. Any commerce.

- **Decimation**: Roman soldiers signed a sacramentum. If a legion loses a battle and cowardice is suspected, 10% are put to death by lottery. The magic number is one in ten -- more would weaken the army; less would make cowardice dominant
- **To burn one's vessels**: Arab commander Tarek crossed into Spain in 711, had his ships put to fire. "Behind you is the sea, before you, the enemy. You are vastly outnumbered. All you have is sword and courage." He took control of Spain
- **Almutanabbi**: The greatest Arabic poet, dying for his poetry -- turned to face a hostile tribe rather than suffer the dishonor of running from his own boastful verses. A thousand years later, when we recite his verses, we know they are genuine

#### Soul in the Game

- Beyond skin in the game: **doxastic commitment** -- a belief-pledge translated into deeds. A prophet is not someone who first had an idea, but the one to first believe in it and take it to its conclusion
- **Champagne socialism**: Never listen to a leftist who does not give away his fortune. French president Mitterrand emulated the pomp of monarchs on a socialist platform; conservative De Gaulle led a life of old-style austerity. **Ralph Nader** exhibits absolutely no divorce between what he preaches and his lifestyle -- a secular saint
- **Thomas Friedman problem**: The fragilista journalist who helped cause the Iraq war, paying no price. Ancient Mediterranean ethics: he who does not stop a crime is an accomplice. There is **no penalty for opinion makers** who harm society
- **The problem of insulation**: Harry Markowitz, who started "portfolio selection" and received the "Nobel" in economics, does not use his own method for his portfolio -- he has recourse to simpler cabdrivers' methodologies. Heuristic: if a researcher whose ideas are applicable to the real world does not apply them to his daily life, ignore him
- **Happiness and middle class values**: Taleb is distraught by the glorified heroism-free "middle class values" -- enshrining "hard work" for a bank or tobacco company, diligent newspaper reading, obedience, dependence on the opinion of a boss. If success is random, a conscious act of heroism is nonrandom

### Chapter 25: Conclusion

- **Standing on one leg**: Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty. The glass on the table is short volatility -- dead. Living things are long volatility

> "The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations. Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren't for hunger; results are meaningless without effort, joy without sadness, convictions without uncertainty, and an ethical life isn't so when stripped of personal risks."

- **Distributed randomness** is a necessity, not an option. Everything big is short volatility. Big and fast are abominations. Modern times don't like volatility

### Epilogue: From Resurrection to Resurrection

- **Fat Tony dies** of an aortic aneurism while Nero is in the Levant celebrating the death and rebirth of Adonis. Tony's estate was flawless: debt-free, conservative, fairly distributed, with discreet funds for a woman (antifragile obsessive love)
- **The posthumous prank**: Tony bequeathed Nero twenty million dollars for a secret mission -- noble, but secret, vague, and dangerous. The best compliment Nero ever got: **trusting that Nero would be able to read his mind.** Which he did.

---

## Technical Appendices: Key Ideas

### The Conflation of Events and Exposure

- **f(x)** is *exposure* to variable **x**. One can become antifragile to x without understanding x, through convexity of f(x). The answer to "what do you do in a world you don't understand?" is: work on the undesirable states of f(x)
- **Convex transformation** (the "barbell"): Modify f(x) to make knowledge of the extreme left-tail of x irrelevant. If you buy insurance on the market dropping more than 20%, f(x) is impervious to the distribution below that threshold
- **Green lumber fallacy** (technical): Confusing f(x) for another function g(x) with different nonlinearities

### Why Small Probabilities Are Incomputable

- Small probabilities are **convex** to errors of computation. A 5% error in standard deviation raises "three sigma" probability by 60% but only lowers it 40%. For "six sigma": five times worse. For "ten sigma": more than a billion times
- Even taking a Gaussian with layered proportional errors converges to very **thick-tailed distributions**. Fukushima's "once per million years" becomes once per 30 when properly accounting for uncertainty layers

### Government Deficits and Concavity

- Government estimates 9% unemployment, projects 200 billion deficit. But: at 8% unemployment, deficit is only 75 billion; at 10%, deficit is 550 billion. The **concavity bias** is -112.5 billion -- variability systematically worsens the outcome

### Ricardo's Comparative Advantage Under Fat Tails

- Ricardo assumes prices remain constant. If wine price drops 40%, massive harm exceeds benefits from a 40% rise. The Irish potato famine: monoculture is among the most lethal strategies in history
- Specialization should emerge through organic tinkering, not top-down imposition. Systems make small errors; design makes large ones. The role of policy is *via negativa*: prevent what hinders the emergence of specialization

### The Markowitz Incoherence

- If probability is "estimated" to be zero, we have a problem: something estimated needs estimation error. Economic models are extremely fragile to assumptions
- Correlations are never the same in different measurements. 80% of kurtosis in 10,000 data points can come from one observation. **Fat tails mean incomputability of tail events, little else**
- **Kelly criterion vs. Markowitz**: Kelly requires no joint distribution or utility function. Bounded trial and error is compatible with Kelly and should outperform "Fragilista Markowitz"

### Sources of Fragility in Economic Models

| Model | Source of Fragility | Remedy |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Portfolio theory (Markowitz) | Assumes knowledge of parameters; unstable correlations | 1/n strategy, barbells |
| Ricardian comparative advantage | Missing randomness in prices | Natural tinkering |
| Samuelson optimization | Concentration under concavity | Distributed randomness |
| Arrow-Debreu state-space | Assumes exhaustive knowledge of outcomes | Metaprobabilities |
