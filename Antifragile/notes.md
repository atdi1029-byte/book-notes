# Antifragile — Detailed Notes

## Prologue

### I. How to Love the Wind

- **Wind as metaphor**: Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes fire — likewise with randomness, uncertainty, and chaos, you want to use them, not hide from them
- You want to be the fire and wish for the wind
- The goal is not merely to survive uncertainty but to **dominate, domesticate, and conquer** the unseen, the opaque, and the inexplicable — like a certain class of aggressive Roman Stoics who sought to have the last word

### II. The Antifragile

- **Core definition**: Some things benefit from shocks — they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, stressors, and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty
- There is no word for the exact opposite of fragile — Taleb coins the term **antifragile**
- **Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness** — the resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better
- This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance, and even our own existence as a species
- **Antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex) and what is inert** — like a stapler on your desk vs. the human body
- The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty — crucially, a love of errors, a certain class of errors
- Antifragility allows us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them — and do them well

> "Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I'd rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time."

- Things around us that like a measure of stressors and volatility: economic systems, your body, your nutrition (diabetes and many modern ailments seem associated with a lack of randomness in feeding and the absence of the stressor of occasional starvation), your psyche
- There are even **financial contracts that are antifragile** — explicitly designed to benefit from market volatility
- **Antifragility and fragility are degrees on a spectrum** — just as we cannot improve health without reducing disease, or increase wealth without first decreasing losses

### Nonprediction

- By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to **nonpredictive decision making** under uncertainty in business, politics, medicine, and life in general
- **Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable** (outside of casinos or the minds of people who call themselves "risk experts")
- This provides a solution to the **Black Swan problem** — the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence
- **Sensitivity to harm from volatility is tractable**, more so than forecasting the event that would cause the harm
- The proposal: stand current approaches to prediction, prognostication, and risk management on their heads
- **Simple test of asymmetry**: anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile
- In every domain, we can propose rules for moving from the fragile toward the antifragile, through reduction of fragility or harnessing of antifragility

### Deprivation of Antifragility

- **Critical insight**: antifragility is the property of all natural (and complex) systems that have survived — depriving these systems of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them; they will weaken, die, or blow up
- We have been **fragilizing the economy, our health, political life, education, almost everything** by suppressing randomness and volatility
- Just as spending a month in bed leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened, even killed, when deprived of stressors
- Much of our modern, structured world has been harming us with **top-down policies and contraptions** (dubbed **"Soviet-Harvard delusions"** in the book) — an insult to the antifragility of systems
- **The tragedy of modernity**: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most
- Everything **top-down fragilizes** and blocks antifragility and growth; everything **bottom-up thrives** under the right amount of stress and disorder
- The process of discovery (or innovation, or technological progress) depends on **antifragile tinkering, aggressive risk bearing** rather than formal education

### Upside at the Expense of Others

- The largest fragilizer of society and greatest generator of crises: **absence of "skin in the game"**
- Some become antifragile at the expense of others by getting the upside (or gains) from volatility, variations, and disorder and exposing others to the downside risks of losses or harm
- Such **antifragility-at-the-cost-of-fragility-of-others** is hidden — given the blindness to antifragility by the Soviet-Harvard intellectual circles, this asymmetry is rarely identified and never taught
- During the **financial crisis starting in 2008**, blowup risks-to-others were easily concealed owing to the growing complexity of modern institutions and political affairs
- In the past, people of rank or status were those who took risks and had the downside for their actions — heroes were those who did so for the sake of others; today the exact reverse is taking place
- The rise of a new class of **inverse heroes**: bureaucrats, bankers, Davos-attending members of the I.A.N.D. (International Association of Name Droppers), and academics with too much power and no real downside and/or accountability — they game the system while citizens pay the price
- At no point in history have so many **non-risk-takers** (those with no personal exposure) exerted so much control

> "The chief ethical rule is the following: Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others."

### III. The Antidote to the Black Swan

- **Black Swans** (capitalized) are large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence — unpredicted by a certain observer, and such an unpredictor is generally called the "turkey" when he is both surprised and harmed by these events
- Taleb's claim: most of history comes from Black Swan events, while we worry about fine-tuning our understanding of the ordinary, developing models, theories, or representations that cannot possibly track or measure the possibility of these shocks
- **Black Swans hijack our brains** — making us feel we "sort of" or "almost" predicted them because they are retrospectively explainable; we don't realize the role of these Swans in life because of the **illusion of predictability**
- Life is more labyrinthine than shown in our memory — our minds turn history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness
- When we see randomness, we fear it and overreact; because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems disrupt the invisible logic of things and tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit

> "You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness."

- **Complex systems** are full of interdependencies — hard to detect — and nonlinear responses
- **"Nonlinear"** means that when you double the dose of, say, a medication, or double the number of employees in a factory, you don't get twice the initial effect, but rather a lot more or a lot less
- Two weekends in Philadelphia are not twice as pleasant as a single one — when plotted on a graph, the response shows as a **curve, not a straight line**
- In such an environment, simple causal associations are misplaced; it is hard to see how things work by looking at single parts
- Man-made complex systems tend to develop **cascades and runaway chains of reactions** that decrease, even eliminate, predictability and cause outsized events
- The modern world may be increasing in technological knowledge but, paradoxically, it is making things a lot more unpredictable

## Book I: The Antifragile: An Introduction

- The first two chapters introduce and illustrate antifragility
- **Chapter 3** introduces a distinction between the organic and the mechanical — between your cat and a washing machine
- **Chapter 4** is about how the antifragility of some comes from the fragility of others, how errors benefit some, not others — the sort of things people tend to call evolution

### Half of Life Has No Name

- **The post office package thought experiment**: You are sending a package of champagne glasses to a cousin in Central Siberia. You would stamp "fragile," "breakable," or "handle with care" on it. Now what is the exact opposite of "fragile"?
- Almost everyone answers that the opposite of "fragile" is "robust," "resilient," "solid," or something of the sort — but **this is wrong**
- The resilient, robust (and company) are items that **neither break nor improve** — you would not need to write anything on them. Have you ever seen a package with "robust" in thick green letters stamped on it?
- Logically, the exact opposite of a "fragile" parcel would be a package on which one has written **"please mishandle"** or **"please handle carelessly"** — its contents would not just be unbreakable, but would **benefit from shocks** and a wide array of trauma
- **The fragile** is the package that would be *at best* unharmed; **the robust** would be *at best* and *at worst* unharmed; and **the opposite of fragile** is therefore what is *at worst* unharmed
- The neologism **"antifragile"** was necessary as there is no simple, noncompound word in the *Oxford English Dictionary* that expresses the point of reverse fragility
- **Antifragility is not part of our consciousness** — but luckily, it is part of our ancestral behavior, our biological apparatus, and a ubiquitous property of every system that has survived
- **The blind spot is universal**: there is no word for "antifragility" in the main known languages — modern, ancient, colloquial, or slang. Even Russian (Soviet version) and Standard Brooklyn English don't seem to have a designation for it, conflating it with robustness
- Taleb checked most Indo-European languages (Latin, Greek, Romance, Slavic, Germanic, Indo-Iranian) and non-Indo-European families (Semitic, Turkic) — absent from all

> "Half of life — the interesting half of life — we don't have a name for."

- **Analogy to positive/negative**: since the opposite of *positive* is *negative*, not *neutral*, the opposite of positive fragility should be **negative fragility** (hence "antifragility"), not neutral, which would just convey robustness, strength, and unbreakability
- **Mathematically**, antifragility is fragility with a negative sign in front of it

### Please Behead Me

- If we have no common name for antifragility, we can find it through **mythological equivalence** — the expression of historical intelligence through potent metaphors
- **Damocles**: In a Roman recycled version of a Greek myth, the Sicilian tyrant Dionysius II has the fawning courtier Damocles enjoy luxury at a banquet, but with a sword hanging over his head, tied to the ceiling by a single hair from a horse's tail. The thing eventually breaks — blood, high-pitched screams, and the equivalent of ancient ambulances. **Damocles is fragile** — it is only a matter of time before the sword strikes him down
- **Phoenix**: In an ancient Semitic and Egyptian legend recycled by the Greeks, the bird with splendid colors is destroyed and reborn from its own ashes, always returning to its initial state. Phoenix is the ancient symbol of **Beirut**, the city where Taleb grew up. According to legend, Berytus has been destroyed seven times in its five-thousand-year history and come back seven times. Taleb saw the eighth episode — central Beirut was completely destroyed during the brutal civil war during his late childhood, and he also saw its eighth rebuilding
- **Beirut rebuilt even better** than its previous incarnation — the earthquake of A.D. 551 had buried the Roman law school, which was discovered as a bonus from history during reconstruction. **That's not Phoenix, but something else beyond the robust** — which brings us to the third mythological metaphor
- **Hydra**: In Greek mythology, a serpent-like creature dwelling in the lake of Lerna, near Argos, with numerous heads. Each time one is cut off, **two grow back**. So harm is what it likes. **Hydra represents antifragility**
- **The sword of Damocles** represents the side effect of power and success: you cannot rise and rule without facing continuous danger — someone will actively be working to topple you. The danger will be silent, inexorable, and discontinuous — falling abruptly after long periods of quiet
- **Black Swans will be out to get you** as you now have much more to lose — a cost of success (and growth), perhaps an unavoidable penalty of excessive success
- **The Triad's key insight**: in many situations we can measure the **strength of the string** — not the wealth and power of the dining party. This is an identifiable, measurable, and tractable vulnerability
- **Toxic growth-followed-by-a-fall**: consider how the fall of the dining guest, in response to the fall of the sword of Damocles, will bring what we now call **collateral damage**, harming others — e.g., the collapse of a large institution will have effects on society
- **Sophistication brings fragility to Black Swans**: as societies gain complexity, with more "cutting edge" sophistication and specialization, they become increasingly vulnerable to collapse. This idea has been brilliantly adumbrated by the archeologist **Joseph Tainter**
- But it does not have to be so — to counter success, you need a high offsetting dose of robustness, even high doses of antifragility. **You want to be Phoenix, or possibly Hydra. Otherwise the sword of Damocles will get you**

### On the Necessity of Naming

- **We know more than we think we do** — a lot more than we can articulate. If our formal systems of thought don't have a name for antifragility, and fight the concept whenever we use our brains, it does not mean our actions neglect it
- Our perceptions and intuitions, as expressed in deeds, can be **superior to what we know and tabulate**, discuss in words, and teach in a classroom
- The potent notion of the **apophatic** (what cannot be explicitly said, or directly described, in our current vocabulary) will be discussed later
- **Guy Deutscher's** *Through the Language Glass*: many primitive populations, without being color-blind, have verbal designations for only two or three colors — yet when given a simple test, they can successfully match strings to their corresponding colors. They detect differences between nuances of the rainbow but do not express them in their vocabularies. These populations are **culturally, though not biologically, color-blind**
- Just as we are intellectually, not organically, **antifragility-blind** — you need the name "blue" for the construction of a narrative, but not when you engage in action
- **Many colors we take for granted had no name for a long time** and had no names in the central texts in Western culture. Ancient Mediterranean texts (Greek and Semitic) had a reduced vocabulary of colors polarized around the dark and the light — Homer and his contemporaries were limited to about three or four main colors: black, white, and some indeterminate part of the rainbow, often subsumed as red or yellow
- **Guy Deutscher** pointed out that the ancients even lacked words for something as elementary as blue — explaining Homer's recurring reference to the **"wine-dark sea"** (*oinopa ponton*), which has been quite puzzling to readers
- **William Gladstone**, British Prime Minister, first made the discovery of limited ancient color vocabulary in the 1850s, in an impressive seventeen-hundred-page treatise on Homer. Gladstone attributed this limitation to a cross-generational training of the eye, but regardless, people were shown to be able to identify the nuances — unless physically color-blind
- Gladstone showed remarkable prescience: he figured out that the *Iliad* corresponds to a true story (the city of Troy had not been discovered yet), and of great relevance to this book, he was insistent upon a **balanced fiscal budget** — fiscal deficits have proven to be a prime source of fragility in social and economic systems

### Proto-Antifragility

- There have been names for two **starter-antifragility concepts** — two precursor applications that cover some special cases, mild aspects of antifragility limited to the medical field
- **Mithridatism**: According to legend, **Mithridates IV**, king of Pontus in Asia Minor, while hiding after his father's assassination, got himself some protection against poisoning by ingesting sub-lethal doses of toxic material in progressively larger quantities. He later incorporated the process into a complicated religious ritual. But this immunity got him in trouble later — when his attempt to take his own life by poisoning failed ("having fortified himself against the drugs of others"), he had to ask for a sword blow instead
- The method named **Antidotum Mithridatium**, celebrated by Celsus, the ancient world's famous doctor, became rather fashionable in Rome — until it brought complications for the emperor Nero's attempts at matricide
- **Nero and Agrippina**: Nero wanted to kill his mother Agrippina, who was Caligula's sister and the alleged lover of the philosopher Seneca. Agrippina, suspecting Nero had a contract on her, **Mithridatized herself** against the poisons available to her son's underlings. Like Mithridates, she eventually died by more mechanical methods (assassins)
- **Lesson**: one cannot be robust against everything — and two thousand years later, nobody has found a method for getting "fortified" against swords
- **Mithridatization** = the result of an exposure to a small dose of a substance that, over time, makes one immune to additional, larger quantities. It is the approach used in **vaccination and allergy medicine**. It is not quite antifragility — still at the more modest level of robustness — but a hint that perhaps being deprived of poison makes us fragile and that the road to robustification starts with a modicum of harm
- **Hormesis**: When the poisonous substance, in some dose, makes you **better off overall** — one step up from robustness. A word coined by pharmacologists: when a small dose of a harmful substance is actually beneficial for the organism, acting as medicine
- A little bit of an otherwise offending substance, not too much, acts to benefit the organism and make it better overall as it triggers some **overreaction**
- This was not interpreted at the time in the sense of "gains from harm" so much as **"harm is dose dependent"** or **"medicine is dose dependent"** — the interest to scientists has been in the nonlinearity of the dose-response
- **Hormesis was well known by the ancients** (and like the color blue was known but not expressed). It was only in **1888** that it was first "scientifically" described (though still not given a name) by a German toxicologist, **Hugo Schulz**, who observed that small doses of poison stimulate the growth of yeast while larger doses cause harm
- Some researchers hold that the benefits of vegetables may not be so much in what we call "vitamins" or some other rationalizing theories, but in the following: **plants protect themselves from harm and fend off predators with poisonous substances** that, ingested by us in the right quantities, may stimulate our organisms — limited, low-dose poisoning triggers healthy benefits
- **Caloric restriction** (permanent or episodic) activates healthy reactions and switches that, among other benefits, lengthen life expectancy in laboratory animals. It looks like such restriction makes humans healthier (and may also improve their sense of humor). But since abundance would bring the opposite effect, this can be interpreted as: **too much regular food is bad for you**, and depriving humans of the stressor of hunger may make them live less than their full potential
- **All hormesis seems to be doing is reestablishing the natural dosage for food and hunger in humans** — hormesis is the norm, and its absence is what hurts us
- Hormesis lost scientific respect after the 1930s because some people mistakenly associated it with **homeopathy** — but the association was unfair, as the mechanisms are extremely different. Homeopathy has shown little empirical backing; hormesis, as a phenomenon, has ample scientific evidence to back it up
- **Larger point**: depriving systems of stressors, vital stressors, is not necessarily a good thing, and can be **downright harmful**

### Domain Independence Is Domain Dependent

- The idea that systems may need some stress and agitation has been **missed by those who grasp it in one area and not in another** — this is **domain dependence** of our minds, a "domain" being an area or category of activity
- Some people can understand an idea in one domain (say, medicine) and **fail to recognize it in another** (say, socioeconomic life). Or they get it in the classroom, but not in the more complicated texture of the street. Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them
- **The Dubai banker anecdote**: Taleb saw a fellow who looked like a banker have a uniformed porter carry his luggage in a hotel driveway, then fifteen minutes later saw the same banker lifting free weights at the gym, trying to replicate natural exercises using kettlebells **as if he were swinging a suitcase**. Domain dependence is pervasive
- **Medical domain dependence**: Mithridatization and hormesis can be known in (some) medical circles and missed in other applications such as socioeconomic life. Even within medicine, some get it here and miss it there — the same doctor might recommend exercise so you "get tougher," and a few minutes later write a prescription for antibiotics in response to a trivial infection so you "don't get sick"
- **Federal Reserve domain dependence**: Ask a U.S. citizen if some semi-governmental agency with a great deal of independence should control the price of cars, morning newspapers, and Malbec wine — he would jump in anger. But then ask if that same government agency should control foreign exchange or interest rates — same reaction: this is not France. Yet the **Federal Reserve Bank** is in the business of controlling and managing the price of another good, called the lending rate (the interest rate in the economy). The libertarian presidential candidate **Ron Paul** was called a crank for suggesting the abolition of the Federal Reserve
- **Translation blindness**: Imagine someone gifted in learning languages but unable to transfer concepts from one tongue to another — he would need to relearn "chair" or "love" or "apple pie" every time he acquires a new language. We are all similarly handicapped, unable to recognize the same idea when it is presented in a different context
- We are doomed to be deceived by the most superficial part of things, the packaging, the gift wrapping — this is why we don't see antifragility in places that are obvious, too obvious
- It is not part of the accepted way of thinking about success, economic growth, or innovation that these may result only from **overcompensation against stressors** — nor do we see this overcompensation at work elsewhere
- **Domain dependence** is also why it has been difficult for many researchers to realize that uncertainty, incomplete understanding, disorder, and volatility are **members of the same close family**
- This lack of translation is a mental handicap that comes with being human — we will only start to attain wisdom or rationality when we make an effort to overcome and break through it

### Post-Traumatic Growth

- Taleb's own domain dependence was revealed while sitting in the office of **David Halpern**, a U.K. government advisor and policy maker, who informed him of a phenomenon called **post-traumatic growth** — the opposite of post-traumatic stress syndrome, by which people harmed by past events surpass themselves
- Taleb had never heard about it before, and to his great shame, had never made the effort to think of its existence — there is a small literature but it is not advertised outside a narrow discipline
- We hear about the more lurid **post-traumatic stress disorder**, not post-traumatic growth, in the intellectual and so-called learned vocabulary — but popular culture has an awareness of its equivalent, revealed in the expression **"it builds character."** So do the ancient Mediterranean classics, along with grandmothers
- **Intellectuals tend to focus on negative responses from randomness** (fragility) rather than the positive ones (antifragility) — this is not just in psychology: it prevails across the board

### Innovation from Necessity

- **How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble** — serious, but not terminal, trouble
- Taleb holds — as a conviction, not speculation — that **innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity**, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity (from the unintended side effects of, say, an initial invention or attempt at invention)
- Classical thoughts on this subject: a Latin saying that sophistication is born out of hunger (**artificia docuit fames**). In Ovid, difficulty is what wakes up the genius (**ingenium mala saepe movent**), which translates in Brooklyn English into "When life gives you a lemon..."
- **The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!**
- This message from the ancients contradicts modern methods and ideas of innovation and progress on many levels — we tend to think innovation comes from bureaucratic funding, through planning, or by putting people through a Harvard Business School class by one Highly Decorated Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (who never innovated anything) or hiring a consultant (who never innovated anything)
- This is a fallacy — note the disproportionate contribution of **uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs** to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley
- Despite the visibility of the counterevidence, and the wisdom you can pick up free of charge from the ancients (or grandmothers), moderns try today to create inventions from situations of **comfort, safety, and predictability** instead of accepting the notion that "necessity really is the mother of invention"
- **Cato the Censor**, the great Roman statesman, looked at comfort, almost any form of comfort, as a road to waste. He did not like it when we had it too easy, as he worried about the weakening of the will — and the softening he feared was not just at the personal level: an entire society can fall ill
- **Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity** — consider that as Taleb writes, we are living in a debt crisis: the world as a whole has never been richer, and it has never been more heavily in debt, living off borrowed money. The record shows that for society, the richer we become, the harder it gets to live within our means

### Automation and the Loss of Challenge

- **Cato** would have smiled hearing about the recently observed effect in aeronautics that the automation of airplanes is **underchallenging pilots**, making flying too comfortable for them — dangerously comfortable
- The dulling of the pilot's attention and skills from too *little* challenge is indeed causing deaths from flying accidents
- Part of the problem is an **FAA regulation** that forced the industry to increase its reliance on automated flying — but thankfully, the same FAA finally figured out the problem; it has recently found that pilots often **"abdicate too much responsibility to automated systems"**

### How to Win a Horse Race

- **The best horses lose when they compete with slower ones, and win against better rivals** — undercompensation from the absence of a stressor, inverse hormesis, absence of challenge, degrades the best of the best
- In Baudelaire's poem, "The albatross's giant wings prevent him from walking" — many do better in Calculus 103 than Calculus 101
- **Overcompensation hides in the most unlikely places**: if tired after an intercontinental flight, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting. If you need something urgently done, give the task to the busiest (or second busiest) person in the office. Most humans manage to squander their free time — the busier they get, the more active they are at other tasks. Overcompensation, here again
- **Whispering, not shouting**: Taleb discovered a trick when giving lectures — rather than speaking with the fake articulation of TV announcers or dancing on stage, he resolved to **whisper, not shout**. Better to be slightly inaudible, less clear
- When he was a pit trader (standing in a crowded arena shouting and screaming in a continuous auction), he learned that the noise produced by the person is **inverse to the pecking order** — as with mafia dons, the most powerful traders were the least audible
- One should have enough self-control to make the audience work hard to listen, which causes them to switch into **intellectual overdrive**
- There is empirical evidence of the effect of **"disfluency"**: mental effort moves us into higher gear, activating more vigorous and more analytical brain machinery
- **Peter Drucker** (management guru) and **Jacques Lacan** (psychoanalyst), two persons who mesmerized crowds the most in their respective areas, were the antithesis of the polished-swanky speaker or the consonant-trained television announcer
- The same mechanism of overcompensation makes us **concentrate better in the presence of a modicum of background random noise**

## Chapter 2: Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere (continued)

### Antifragile Responses as Redundancy

- When Taleb heard "post-traumatic growth" during his London visit, it hit him: **antifragile hormetic responses were just a form of redundancy**, and all the ideas of Mother Nature converged — Nature likes to overinsure itself
- **Layers of redundancy** are the central risk management property of natural systems — we humans have two kidneys, extra spare parts, and extra capacity in many organs (lungs, neural system, arterial apparatus)
- Human design tends to be spare and inversely redundant — we engage in **debt**, which is the opposite of redundancy (fifty thousand in extra cash under the mattress is redundancy; owing the bank an equivalent amount is the opposite)
- **Redundancy is ambiguous** because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens — except that something unusual *usually* happens
- Redundancy is not necessarily defensive; it can be **extremely aggressive** — if you have extra inventory of fertilizers and there's a shortage due to disruptions in China, you can sell at a huge premium
- **Overcompensation is just a form of redundancy** — an additional head for the Hydra is no different from an extra kidney for humans, or extra cash in the bank
- A system that overcompensates is necessarily in **overshooting mode**, building extra capacity and strength in anticipation of a worse outcome
- **Redundancy is not defensive; it is more like investment than insurance** — tell the next MBA analyst that what they call "inefficient" is often very efficient

### The Lucretius Problem

- Risk management professionals look at **worst-case scenarios** from past data ("stress testing"), but they never notice that this so-called worst case *exceeded the worst case at the time*
- Taleb calls this mental defect **the Lucretius problem**, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed
- In **Pharaonic Egypt**, bureaucratic scribes tracked the high-water mark of the Nile and used it as a future worst-case estimate
- The **Fukushima nuclear reactor** was built to withstand the worst past historical earthquake — the builders never imagined much worse
- **Alan Greenspan** offered Congress the classic "it never happened before"
- Nature, unlike Fragilista Greenspan, prepares for what has not happened before, **assuming worse harm is possible**
- If humans fight the last war, **nature fights the next one** — your body is more imaginative about the future than you are
- **Maximum lifts in weightlifting** illustrate the point: Taleb trained with "Lenny Cake," focusing solely on improving one's past maximum in a single lift — the body *predicts* it will need to lift more next time, building additional strength automatically

### On the Antifragility of Riots, Love, and Other Unexpected Beneficiaries of Stress

- Once one overcomes domain dependence, the phenomenon of overcompensation appears **ubiquitous**
- **Seneca** in *De clemencia* on the inverse effect of punishments: "Repeated punishment, while it crushes the hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of all ... just as trees that have been trimmed throw out again countless branches"
- **Revolutions feed on repression**, growing heads faster and faster as one literally cuts a few off

> "The higher you build your barricades, the stronger we become." — Irish revolutionary song

- Political movements and rebellions can be **highly antifragile** — the sucker game is to try to repress them using brute force
- One of the most antifragile things outside economic life is **obsessive love (or hate)** — a refractory passion that overreacts and overcompensates for impediments
- In Proust's *La recherche*, Swann falls for Odette — her elusive behavior fuels his obsession. In Buzzati's *Un amore*, a middle-aged Milanese man falls for a dancer who exploits him; the more she mistreats him, the more he exposes himself
- Like tormenting love, **some thoughts are so antifragile** that you feed them by trying to get rid of them — the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas, the more your ideas end up controlling you

### Please Ban My Book: The Antifragility of Information

- **Information is antifragile** — it feeds more on attempts to harm it than on efforts to promote it
- The wily Venetians knew how to spread information by disguising it as a secret — the more you insist it remain a secret, the more it will spread
- Books and ideas are **antifragile to attacks** — as Marcus Aurelius wrote, "fire feeds on obstacles." Banned books thrive: Graham Greene's *The Power and the Glory*, Henry Miller, *Madame Bovary*, *Lady Chatterley's Lover*
- The **Ayn Rand phenomenon**: *Atlas Shrugged* and *The Fountainhead* have been read for more than half a century by millions, *in spite of* — or most likely *thanks to* — brutally nasty reviews
- **Criticism is an unfaked badge of attention** signaling a book is not boring — and boring is the only truly bad thing for a book
- **Heuristic**: to estimate the quality of research, take the caliber of the highest detractor, or the caliber of the lowest detractor whom the author answers in print — whichever is lower
- Taleb's great-grandfather **Nicolas Ghosn**, a wily politician who stayed permanently in power, told his grandson from his deathbed: "My son, I am very disappointed in you. I never hear anything wrong said about you. You have proven yourself incapable of generating envy."

### Get Another Job

- It is not possible to stamp out criticism; if it harms you, **get out** — it is easier to change jobs than control your reputation
- Some jobs and professions are **fragile to reputational harm** — in the age of the Internet, these jobs aren't worth having. Focus on altering your exposure
- A writer is antifragile; most modernistic professions are usually not
- Someone earning close to minimum wage — a construction worker or taxi driver — does not overly depend on his reputation and is **free to have his own opinions**. A midlevel bank employee with a mortgage would be **completely a prisoner** of the value system
- **Heuristic for detecting independence**: those who dress outrageously are robust or even antifragile in reputation; those in suits and ties are fragile to information about them
- Large corporations and governments that try to control information and "reinstill confidence" are **revealing their fragility** — information is merciless
- When you don't have debt, you don't care about your reputation in economics circles — **people lend the most to those who need them the least**

## Chapter 3: The Cat and the Washing Machine

*Stress is knowledge (and knowledge is stress) — The organic and the mechanical — No translator needed, for now — Waking up the animal in us, after two hundred years of modernity*

### The Organic vs. the Mechanical

- **Bold conjecture**: everything that has life in it is to some extent antifragile (but not the reverse) — it looks like the secret of life is antifragility
- The natural — the biological — is both antifragile and fragile, depending on the source and range of variation. A human body can benefit from stressors (to get stronger), but only to a point
- Your bones get denser when episodic stress is applied to them — **Wolff's Law** (1892)
- A dish, a car, an inanimate object will not — these may be robust but cannot be intrinsically antifragile
- **Brent Carey's 2011 experiment**: carbon nanotubes arranged in a certain manner produce a self-strengthening response previously unseen in synthetic materials — crossing the boundary between living and inanimate
- We can use the distinction as a marker between living and nonliving: **the artificial needs to be antifragile for us to be able to use it as tissue**
- The **phenomenon of aging is misunderstood** — failures to self-repair come largely from **maladjustment**, either too few stressors or too little time for recovery. Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort — a disease of civilization
- In a natural environment, people die without aging — or after a very short period of aging. **Artificial aging comes from stifling internal antifragility**

### The Complex

- The effective distinction is between **noncomplex and complex systems** — more effective than biological/nonbiological
- Many things such as society, economic activities, markets, and cultural behavior are man-made but grow on their own to reach self-organization — closer to the cat than to the washing machine, but **mistaken for washing machines**
- Artificial, man-made mechanical contraptions are *complicated*, but not "complex" — they don't have interdependencies. Push a button, get an exact response
- With **complex systems, interdependencies are severe** — remove a specific animal from a food chain and you get cascading complications
- In the complex world, the notion of "cause" itself is suspect — it is either nearly impossible to detect or not really defined

### Stressors Are Information

- The crux of complex systems is that they **convey information to their component parts through stressors** — your body gets information about the environment not through your intelligence, but through stress, via hormones or other messengers
- Your bones get stronger when subjected to gravity; they become weaker in a space station with zero gravity. Your skin callouses from bicycle riding, tans in summer
- **Errors and their consequences are information**; for small children, pain is the only risk management information
- For complex systems, everything is about information — this is **causal opacity**: it is hard to see the arrow from cause to consequence

### Equilibrium, Not Again

- For the complexity theorist **Stuart Kaufman**, the social scientist's goal of "equilibrium" can be death
- *For the nonorganic, noncomplex, equilibrium happens in a state of inertia. So for something organic, equilibrium only happens with death*
- **Dissipative structures** (Ilya Prigogine): organisms and dynamic systems exist permanently "far from equilibrium" — a state of normalcy requires volatility, randomness, and stress

### Crimes Against Children

- We are **committing crimes against life** for the sake of eliminating volatility and variation
- One in ten Americans beyond high school is on some kind of antidepressant — but mood swings are a second source of intelligence, perhaps even the first
- Had Prozac been available last century, Baudelaire's "spleen," Poe's moods, Sylvia Plath's poetry would have been silenced

### Punished by Translation

- You pick up a language best through situational difficulty, from error to error — success, wealth, and technology make this mode of acquisition much harder
- The best way to learn a language may be an episode of jail in a foreign country — Taleb's friend Chad Garcia improved his Russian in a Moscow hospital quarantine

### Touristification

- **Touristification**: the systematic removal of uncertainty and randomness from things, making matters highly predictable in their smallest details — all for comfort, convenience, and efficiency
- What a tourist is to an adventurer, touristification is to life — it converts activities into the equivalent of a script
- The guilty parties: the education system, planning, teleological scientific research, gym machines, the electronic calendar
- The worst touristification: **the life we moderns lead in captivity during our leisure hours** — Friday night opera, scheduled parties. A golden jail

### The Secret Thirst for Chance

- If you are alive — something deep in your soul likes a certain measure of randomness and disorder
- **If I could predict what my day would exactly look like, I would feel a little bit dead**
- In an ancestral habitat we were prompted by natural stimuli — fear, hunger, desire — that made us fit for our environment
- An environment with variability does not expose us to **chronic stress injury** — walking on uneven terrain means no two steps are identical, unlike the gym machine forcing endless identical repetitions
- **Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury**

## Chapter 4: What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger

*Antifragility for one is fragility for someone else — Where we introduce the idea that we think too much, do very little — Fail for others to succeed — One day you may get a thank-you note*

### Antifragility by Layers

- **The antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others** — the sacrifices of some fragile units are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole
- **The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile** — that's what makes entrepreneurship work
- **Restaurants** are individually fragile (they compete and fail), but the collective of local restaurants is **antifragile for that very reason** — had they been individually robust, the overall business would deliver nothing better than Soviet cafeteria food
- Some parts *on the inside* of a system may be required to be fragile to make the system antifragile as a result

### Evolution and Unpredictability

- Hormesis is a metaphor; **antifragility is a phenomenon** — Mithridatization and hormesis were "proto-antifragility" concepts, even a bit naive
- There is a different, stronger variety of antifragility linked to **evolution** — operating at the informational level (genes are information). Unlike with hormesis, the unit does not get stronger; **it dies**. But it accomplishes a transfer of benefits
- **Robert Trivers** figured out the competition between gene and organism in his idea of the "selfish gene"
- Evolution only works **because of its antifragility** — it is in love with stressors, randomness, uncertainty, and disorder
- **Organisms need to die for nature to be antifragile** — nature is opportunistic, ruthless, and selfish
- An **immortal organism** would need to predict the future perfectly. But by letting organisms go one lifespan at a time with modifications between generations, nature does not need to predict — **every random event brings its own antidote in the form of ecological variation**
- **Evolution benefits from randomness by two routes**: randomness in mutations, and randomness in the environment

### Organisms Are Populations and Populations Are Organisms

- Physicist turned geneticist **Antoine Danchin**: analysis needs to accommodate layering and hierarchies
- **Fractal self-similarity** (Benoit Mandelbrot): a tree has branches that look like small trees, which have branches like even smaller trees — similarly, cells have populations of molecules, organisms have populations of cells, species have populations of organisms
- A strengthening mechanism for the species comes at the expense of some organisms; the organism strengthens at the expense of some cells
- When you drink a poisonous substance in small amounts, evolutionary processes *within* your system replace bad proteins with stronger, younger ones — a process called **autophagy** — a purely evolutionary process that selects and kills the weakest for fitness

### Thank You, Errors

- **When you are fragile**, you depend on things following the exact planned course — deviations are more harmful than helpful
- **When you are antifragile**, deviations are more helpful than harmful — you don't care about the dispersion of outcomes
- The random element in trial and error is not quite random — **error is used as a source of information**. Every trial tells you what *does not* work, zooming in on a solution

### Learning from the Mistakes of Others

- It is often the mistakes of others that benefit the rest of us
- **Henry Petroski**: had the *Titanic* not had that famous accident, we would have kept building larger ocean liners and the next disaster would have been even more tragic
- **Every plane crash makes the next flight safer** — aviation is set up to exploit small errors, independent from each other
- But **the economic system is not antifragile** as presently built — globalized economic systems operate as one, errors spread and compound
- **If every plane crash makes the next one less likely, every bank crash makes the next one more likely** — we need to eliminate the contagion-producing type of error

### How to Become Mother Teresa

- Variability causes mistakes and adaptations; it also allows you to know who your friends are — sometimes you only know about someone's character after you harm them with an error for which you are solely responsible
- **A loser** is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn't introspect, doesn't exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with new information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on

### Why the Aggregate Hates the Individual

- The economy has equivalent layering: individuals, artisans, small firms, departments within corporations, industries, the regional economy, and the general economy
- For the economy to be antifragile and undergo evolution, **every single individual business must necessarily be fragile** — exposed to breaking
- **Every time you use a coffeemaker**, you are benefiting from the fragility of the coffeemaking entrepreneur who failed — he failed in order to help put the superior merchandise on your kitchen counter
- Natural and nature-like systems want some **overconfidence** on the part of individual economic agents — the overestimation of their chances of success and underestimation of risks of failure. This local (not global) overconfidence is healthy for the economy
- With bailouts, governments favor firms that are large enough to require being saved to avoid contagion — this is **transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit**

### What Does Not Kill Me Kills Others

- Nietzsche's "what does not kill me makes me stronger" can be misinterpreted — it could mean "what did not kill me did *not* make me stronger, but spared me *because* I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone"
- The surviving cohort is clearly stronger than the initial one — but not quite the individuals, since the weaker ones died. **Someone paid a price for the system to improve**

### Me and Us

- The tension between individual and collective interests is new in history — in the past it was dealt with by the near irrelevance of individuals. Sacrifice for the group is behind the notion of **heroism**
- As a humanist, Taleb stands against the antifragility of systems at the expense of individuals — the Enlightenment brought the individual to the fore with rights, freedom, independence, and privacy

### National Entrepreneur Day

- Heroism and the respect it commands is a form of **compensation by society for those who take risks for others** — entrepreneurship is a risky and heroic activity, necessary for growth
- Someone who did *not* find something is providing others with knowledge, the best knowledge — that of *absence* (what does not work) — yet he gets little or no credit for it
- Modern society should be treating ruined entrepreneurs the same way we honor dead soldiers — **there is no such thing as a failed entrepreneur** any more than there is a failed soldier or failed scientific researcher
- Taleb's dream: **National Entrepreneur Day** with the message: "Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking. *You are at the source of our antifragility.* Our nation thanks you."

## Book II: Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility

- **"Volatility"** comes from *volare*, "to fly" in Latin — depriving political and other systems of volatility harms them, causing eventually greater volatility of the cascading type
- Book II deals with the **fragility that comes from the denial of hormesis** — how we hurt systems by playing conductor, fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness
- **Procrustes** was an inn-keeper in Greek mythology who cut the limbs of those too tall and stretched those too short to make travelers fit in his bed — treating an organism like a simple machine is exactly like a Procrustean bed

---

## Chapter 5: The Souk and the Office Building

*The Reds and the Whites all go to Zurich — War is not a prison — The turkey's thwarted projects — Remember we are in Extremistan*

### Two Types of Professions

- **John and George**: identical twin brothers from Cyprus living in Greater London. John is a bank clerk (personnel department, 25 years). George drives a black taxi
- John has a perfectly **predictable income** — monthly paycheck, annual vacation, gold watch every 25 years. Until the banking crisis, when he realized his job could be "made redundant." At fifty, he would never recover
- George the taxi driver has **extremely variable income** — some days several hundred pounds, some days nothing. But year after year, he averages the same as John. He has never had a single day without a fare in 25 years. He is his own boss, and can continue into his eighties
- **The central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing — and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness**
- Artisanal careers harbor a bit of antifragility: small variations make them adapt and change continuously, open to gifts and positive surprises — **free options, the hallmark of antifragility**
- For a self-employed person, a small mistake is information that directs his adaptive approach; for an employee like John, a mistake goes into his permanent record
- **The centralized state resembles John's income; the city-state model resembles George's** — John has one large employer, George many small ones. One has the illusion of stability but is fragile; the other has the illusion of variability but is robust and even antifragile
- **The more variability you observe in a system, the less Black Swan-prone it is**

### Lenin in Zurich

- **Switzerland is the most antifragile place on the planet** — it benefits from shocks that take place in the rest of the world
- Lenin concocted his project of centralized state control while living in Zurich; Nabokov, the emigre Russian aristocrat and victim of Lenin, later spent decades in the same lakefront hotel in Montreux
- Switzerland shelters both the reds and the whites — all manner of financial and political refugees. It is economically the most robust place on the planet, and has been for centuries
- The most stable country in the world **does not have a government** — or rather, it does not have a large *central* government. What governs them is entirely bottom-up: municipal entities called cantons, near-sovereign mini-states united in a confederation
- Bottom-up form of dictatorship provides **protection against the romanticism of utopias** — the process is highly unintellectual, even downright puny, but the system produces stability at every possible level

### Bottom-Up Variations

- **Bottom-up variations** — the type of political volatility within a municipality — is not scalable (not *invariant* under scale transformation). A large state does not behave like a gigantic municipality, much as a baby human does not resemble a smaller adult
- A cluster of municipalities with charming provincial enmities aggregates to a quite benign and stable state — **Switzerland shows stability at the aggregate level, as the ensemble of cantons produces a solid system**, like the cab driver's income
- **"Stalin could not have existed in a municipality"** — small is more antifragile; the large is doomed to breaking
- Biology plays a role in a municipal environment — an administrator is shielded from having to feel the sting of shame (a biological reaction) for overspending and failures. Eye contact with one's peers changes one's behavior
- Lobbyists cannot exist in a municipality or small region — centralization of power (like the European Commission in Brussels) creates a much larger payoff from lobbying at low cost
- The Italian legal philosopher **Bruno Leoni** argued in favor of the robustness of judge-based law (owing to its diversity) as compared to explicit and rigid codified law — true, the choice of a court could be a lottery, but it helps prevent large-scale mistakes
- Switzerland illustrates the **natural antifragility of political systems** — stability is achieved by managing noise, having a mechanism for letting it run its natural course, not by minimizing it
- Switzerland is perhaps the **most successful country in history**, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations — its system, even in banking, was based on **apprenticeship models**, nearly vocational rather than theoretical: on **techne** (crafts and know how), not **episteme** (book knowledge, know what)

### Away from Extremistan

- There is a certain **mathematical property** to bottom-up volatility and to the volatility of natural systems — it generates the kind of randomness Taleb calls **Mediocristan**: plenty of variations that might be scary, but tend to cancel out in the aggregate (over time, or over the collection of municipalities that constitute the larger confederation or entity)
- The alternative is the unruly one called **Extremistan**, in which you have mostly stability and occasionally large chaos — errors there have large consequences
- **Mediocristan** has a lot of small variations, not a single one of which is extreme; **Extremistan** has few variations, but those that take place are extreme
- One fluctuates, the other jumps. One has a lot of small variations, the other varies in lumps — just like the income of the taxi driver compared to that of the bank employee. **The two types of randomness are qualitatively distinct**
- **Caloric intake analogy**: your caloric intake is from Mediocristan — if you add the calories you consume in a year, not a single day will represent much of the total (say, more than 0.5 percent of the total). You cannot double your weight in a single day, not even a month — but you *can* double your net worth or lose half of it in a single moment
- **Novel sales** illustrate Extremistan: more than half of sales (and perhaps 90 percent of profits) tend to come from the top 0.1 percent — the one-in-a-thousand event is dominant
- Financial matters and other economic matters tend to be from **Extremistan**, just like history, which moves by discontinuities and jumps from one state to another
- **Figure 3** illustrates how antifragile systems are hurt when deprived of their natural variations (mostly thanks to naive intervention):
  - **First graph**: Municipal noise / distributed variations in the souks — volatile; it fluctuates but does not sink (like a taxi driver's income)
  - **Second graph**: Centralized or human-managed systems — sinks without significant fluctuations outside episodes of turmoil (like an employee's income). Shows moves taking place from cascade to cascade, or Black Swan to Black Swan
- Human overintervention to smooth or control processes causes a switch from one kind of system (**Mediocristan**) into another (**Extremistan**) — this effect applies to all manner of systems with constrained volatility: health, politics, economics, even someone's mood with and without Prozac
- In the long run the second system will be **far more volatile** — but volatility comes in lumps. When we constrain the first system we tend to get the second outcome
- In **Extremistan** predictability is very low — in the second, pseudo-smooth kind of randomness, mistakes appear to be rare, but they will be large, often devastating when they occur
- Anything locked into planning tends to fail precisely because of these attributes — it is quite a myth that **planning helps corporations**; the world is too random and unpredictable to base a policy on visibility of the future. **What survives comes from the interplay of some fitness and environmental conditions**

### The Great Turkey Problem

- In **Extremistan**, one is prone to be fooled by the properties of the past and get the story exactly backwards
- It is easy, looking at the second graph of Figure 3, before the big jump down, to believe the system is now safe — particularly when the system has made a progressive switch from the "scary" type of visibly volatile randomness at left to the apparently safe right. **It looks like a drop in volatility — and it is not**
- **The Turkey metaphor** (adapted from Bertrand Russell): A turkey is fed for a thousand days by a butcher; every day confirms to its staff of analysts that butchers love turkeys "with increased statistical confidence." The butcher will keep feeding the turkey until a few days before Thanksgiving — then comes that day when it is really not a good idea to be a turkey
- With the butcher surprising it, the turkey will have a **revision of belief** — right when its confidence in the statement that *the butcher loves turkeys* is maximal and "it is very quiet" and soothingly predictable in the life of the turkey
- The key: such a surprise will be a **Black Swan event** — but just for the turkey, not for the butcher
- The **mother of all harmful mistakes**: mistaking absence of evidence (of harm) for evidence of absence — a mistake that tends to prevail in intellectual circles and the social sciences
- Our mission in life becomes simply **"how not to be a turkey"** — or, if possible, how to be a turkey in reverse — antifragile. "Not being a turkey" starts with figuring out the difference between **true and manufactured stability**
- When constrained, volatility-choked systems explode — fitting example: the removal of the **Baath Party**, with the abrupt toppling of Saddam Hussein and his regime in 2003 by the United States. More than a hundred thousand persons died, and ten years later, the place is still a mess

### The Collective vs. the Individual (Chapter 4 continued)

- The unit in **traditional cultures** is the collective — it could be perceived to be harmed by the behavior of an individual: the honor of the family is sullied when a daughter becomes pregnant, or a family member engages in large-scale financial swindles and Ponzi schemes
- In rural France as recently as the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, it was common for someone to spend all his savings to erase the debts of a remote cousin — a practice called **passer l'éponge** (literally, to use a sponge to erase the liability from the chalkboard), to preserve the dignity and good name of the extended family. It was perceived as a duty
- The system needs to be there for the individual to survive — one needs to be careful in glorifying one interest against others in the presence of **interdependence and complexity**
- In the **Cosa Nostra** (Sicilian mafia), the designation "man of honor" (*uomo d'onore*) implies that the person caught by police would remain silent and not rat on his friends, regardless of benefits — life in prison is preferable to a plea that entails hurting other members. **The tribe comes before the individual**
- What broke the back of the mafia was the recent generation of **plea bargainers** — "honor" in the mafia is limited to in-group solidarity; they otherwise lie, and kill people from behind, which on the east side of the Mediterranean is considered the purest form of cowardice
- We humans may have to be **self-centered at the expense of other species**, at the risk of ecological fragility, if it insures our survival — our interests as a human race prevail over those of nature, and we can tolerate some inefficiency and fragility to protect individuals, although sacrificing nature too much may eventually hurt ourselves
- The trade-off between collective and individual: an economy **cannot survive without breaking individual eggs**; protection is harmful, and constraining the forces of evolution to benefit individuals does not seem required. But we can shield individuals from starvation, provide some social protection, and give them respect

### Overconfidence: Benign vs. Harmful

- Psychologists label "overconfidence" a disease, blinding people to the odds of success in ventures — but there is a difference between the **benign, heroic type of risk taking** that is beneficial to others (in the antifragile case) and the nastier modern type related to **negative Black Swans** (e.g., the overconfidence of "scientists" computing risks of harm from the Fukushima reactor)
- In the case of the former, what they call overconfidence is **a good thing, not something to medicate**
- Compare entrepreneurs to the **beancounting managers** of companies who climb the ladder of hierarchy with hardly any real downside — their cohort is rarely at risk
- What Erasmus called **ingratitudo vulgi** (the ingratitude of the masses) is increasing in the age of globalization and the Internet

> "I have noticed that the more people glorify the entrepreneur as an abstraction, the more they will scorn an actual one they meet." — Jean-Louis Rheault

### Twelve Thousand Years

- We started with the example of Switzerland; now Taleb moves farther east to the **northern Levant** — roughly today's northern part of Syria and Lebanon
- The northern Levant stayed perhaps the **most prosperous province in the history of mankind** over a very long stretch of time, from the pre-pottery Neolithic until the middle of the twentieth century — **twelve thousand years** of continuity
- Compared to say, England (prosperous about five hundred years) or Scandinavia (less than three hundred years) — few areas on the planet have thrived with so much continuity over such a protracted stretch of time, what historians call **longue durée**
- Other cities came and went; Aleppo, Emesa (today Homs), and Laodicea (Lattakia) stayed relatively affluent
- The northern Levant was dominated by **traders**, largely owing to its position as a central spot on the **Silk Road**, and by agricultural lords supplying wheat to the Mediterranean world, particularly Rome
- The area supplied a few Roman emperors, a few Catholic popes before the schisms, and more than thirty **Greek language writers and philosophers** (including many heads of Plato's academy), in addition to the ancestors of **Steve Jobs**
- During Roman days the province was managed by **local elites** through a decentralized method of ruling that the Ottoman retained — cities minted their own coins
- After the Great War, one part of the northern Levant was integrated into the newly created nation of **Syria**, separated from its other section, now part of **Lebanon**
- The Ottoman type of imperial peace, the **pax Ottomana**, like its predecessor the **pax Romana**, was good for commerce — contracts were enforced, and that is what governments are needed for the most
- **Philip Mansel's** *Levant* documents how the cities of the Eastern Mediterranean operated as **city-states separated from the hinterland**
- A few decades into the life of Syria, the modernist **Baath Party** came to enforce utopias — as soon as the Baathists centralized the place and enforced their statist laws, Aleppo and Emesa went into **instant decline**
- The Baath Party's "modernization" program was to **remove the archaic mess of the souks** and replace them with the crisp modernism of the office building
- The effect was immediately visible: overnight the **trading families moved** to New York and New Jersey (for the Jews), California (for the Armenians), and Beirut (for the Christians)
- Beirut offered a commerce-friendly atmosphere, and **Lebanon was a benign, smaller, disorganized state** without any real central government — small enough to be a municipality on its own, smaller than a medium-size metropolitan area

### War, Prison, or Both

- While Lebanon had the right qualities, the state was **too loose** — by allowing Palestinian factions and Christian militias to own weapons, it caused an arms race between communities
- **Disorganized is invigorating; but the Lebanese state was one step too disorganized** — it would be like allowing New York mafia bosses to have a larger army than the Joint Chiefs of Staff (just imagine John Gotti with missiles)
- So in **1975** a raging civil war started in Lebanon
- A wealthy Aleppine merchant who fled the Baath regime, when asked by Taleb's grandfather why he did not return to Aleppo during the Lebanese war, answered categorically: **"We people of Aleppo prefer war to prison"** — by "prison" he meant the loss of political and economic freedoms
- Economic life, too, seems to prefer war to prison — Lebanon and Northern Syria had very similar wealth per individual about a century ago, identical cultures, languages, ethnicities, food, and even jokes
- Everything was the same except for the rule of the "modernizing" Baath Party in Syria compared to the totally benign state in Lebanon — in spite of a civil war that decimated the population, causing brain drain and setting wealth back by decades, today **Lebanon has a considerably higher standard of living — between three and six times the wealth of Syria**
- **Machiavelli** did not escape the point — Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, citing him:

> "It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues.... A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom."

### Pax Romana

- The **centralized nation-state** is not exactly new in history — it existed in a nearly identical form in ancient Egypt, but it was an isolated event and did not survive for long; the Egyptian high state started collapsing upon contact with barbaric disorganized harassing invaders from Asia Minor with their assault chariots
- The dynasties of ancient Egypt did not run the place like an empire but like an **integrated state** — markedly different, as it produces different types of variations
- **Nation-states rely on centralized bureaucracy**; whereas empires like the Roman and Ottoman dynasties relied on local elites, allowing city-states to prosper and conserve effective **commercial autonomy**
- The Ottomans did vassals and suzerains a favor by preventing them from involvement in warfare — this took away militaristic temptations and helped them thrive, allowing locals to focus on commerce rather than war
- **David Hume** in his *History of England* argued in favor of small states, as large states get tempted by warfare
- Neither Romans nor Ottomans allowed local autonomy out of love of freedom — they did it for **convenience**. A combination of empire (for some affairs) and semi-independent regions (left alone for business) provides more stability than the centralized nation-state with flags and discrete borders
- Centralized states (Egypt, China) were in practice not too different except for the **centralization of intellect** with the scribes and the mandarinate system establishing a **monopoly of knowledge**
- Before modernity's communication networks (telegraph, train, telephone), a local provincial ruler was king for a large number of matters even though nominally subordinate — until recent history, the central state represented about **5 percent of the economy**, compared to about ten times that share in modern Europe
- Governments were sufficiently distracted by war to **leave economic affairs to businessmen**

### War or No War

- Before the nation-states of Germany and Italy ("re-unification"), Europe was a **fissiparous and amorphous mass** of small statelings and city-states in constant tension but shifting alliances
- Something comforting about statelings at war: mediocrity cannot handle more than one enemy, so war turns into an alliance — tension was always present somewhere but **without large consequences**, like mild rain and no floods. **Mediocristan**
- The contagious creation of nation-states in the late nineteenth century led to the two world wars and their sequels: **more than sixty million (and possibly eighty million) victims**
- The difference between war and *no war* became huge, with marked discontinuity — a switch to **"winner take all"** effects, the domination of rare events
- A collection of statelings is similar to the restaurant business: volatile, but you never have a generalized restaurant crisis, unlike the banking business — because it is composed of **independent and competing small units** that do not individually threaten the system. **Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated**
- Some people have fallen for the naive turkey-style belief that the world is getting safer and safer — they naively attribute safety to the holy "state" (though bottom-up Switzerland has about the lowest rate of violence)
- It is exactly like saying that **nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often** — the world is subjected to fewer and fewer acts of violence, while wars have the potential to be more criminal
- We were very close to the **mother of all catastrophes in the 1960s** when the United States was about to pull the nuclear trigger on the Soviet Union
- In **Extremistan**, we don't look at evidence (evidence comes too late), we look at **potential damage** — never has the world been more prone to more damage; never. Risk is in the future, not in the past
- The messy multi-ethnic **Austro-Hungarian Empire** vanished after the Great War, along with its Ottoman neighbor and rival, replaced with crisp, clean nation-states
- The Ottoman Empire became the state of **Turkey, modeled after Switzerland**, with nobody noticing the inconsistency
- **Vienna** became trapped in Austria, sharing very little outside the formal language
- **Stefan Zweig**, the Viennese Jewish novelist then considered the most influential author in the world, expressed his pain in his poignant memoir *The World of Yesterday*
- Vienna joined the league of multicultural cities such as Alexandria, Aleppo, Prague, Thessaloniki, Constantinople (now Istanbul), Smyrna, and Trieste, now squeezed into the **Procrustean bed of the nation-state**, with citizens left in the grip of intergenerational nostalgia
- Unable to handle the loss and integrate elsewhere, Zweig later **committed suicide in Brazil** — Taleb first read his account while in a similar situation of physical and cultural exile when his Levantine Christian world was shattered by the Lebanese war

### Chapter 5 Footnotes (Key Points)

- A collection of small units with **semi-independent variations** produces vastly different risk characteristics than a single large unit (Henri Pirenne, Max Weber)
- The **European Union** is legally protected from overcentralization thanks to the **principle of subsidiarity**: things should be handled by the smallest possible unit that can manage them with efficacy — inherited from the Catholic Church
- When randomness gets distributed across a large number of small units with small recurrent political disorder, we get **Mediocristan**; when randomness concentrates, we get **Extremistan**
- People invoke "Balkanization" about the mess of fragmented states — but nobody uses **"Helvetization"** to describe its successes
- **Steven Pinker** misread the nature of the statistical process — a war that would decimate the planet would be completely consistent with the statistics; **Ben Bernanke** was similarly fooled with his *Great Moderation*, a turkey problem

## Chapter 6: Tell Them I Love (Some) Randomness

*Maxwell in Extremistan — Complicated mechanisms to feed a donkey — Virgil said to do it, and do it now*

### Tight Controls Cause Blowups (Maxwell's Governors)

- The point of the previous chapter was that the **risk properties of the fragile bank employee are vastly different from those of the comparatively antifragile artisan taxi driver** — likewise, the risk characteristic of a centralized system is different from that of a messy municipally-led confederation
- The second type is stable in the long run **because of** *some* dose of volatility
- A scientific argument showing how tight controls backfire and cause blowups was made by **James Clerk Maxwell** of electromagnetic theory fame
- **"Governors"** are contraptions meant to control the speed of steam engines by compensating for abrupt variations — they aimed at stabilizing engines, and apparently did, but paradoxically sometimes brought **capricious behavior and crashes**
- **Light control works; close control leads to overreaction**, sometimes causing the machinery to break into pieces
- In a famous paper **"On Governors"** (1867), Maxwell modeled the behavior and showed mathematically that **tightly controlling the speed of engines leads to instability**
- Maxwell's derivations can be generalized across domains to debunk **pseudo-stabilization and hidden long-term fragility**
- In markets, fixing prices or eliminating speculators (the so-called "noise traders") and the moderate volatility they bring provides an **illusion of stability**, with periods of calm punctuated with large jumps
- Because players are unused to volatility, the slightest price variation will be attributed to insider information or changes in the state of the system, causing **panics**
- When a currency never varies, a slight move makes people believe the world is ending — **injecting some confusion stabilizes the system**

### The Predictable Person

- Confusing people a little bit is beneficial — imagine someone extremely punctual who comes home at exactly six o'clock every day for fifteen years; you can use his arrival to set your watch. He will cause his family anxiety if he is **barely a few minutes late**
- Someone with a slightly more volatile schedule (half-hour variation) won't cause such alarm

### Variations as Purges

- **Small forest fires** periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material — systematically preventing forest fires **"to be safe" makes the big one much worse**
- For similar reasons, **stability is not good for the economy**: firms become very weak during long periods of steady prosperity devoid of setbacks, and hidden vulnerabilities accumulate silently under the surface — delaying crises is not a good idea
- Absence of fluctuations in the market causes hidden risks to accumulate with impunity — the longer one goes without a market trauma, **the worse the damage when commotion occurs**
- Seasoned trading veterans used a heuristic: when a market reaches a **"new low"** (a level not seen in a long time), there is "a lot of blood" to come — people unused to losing shekels will incur great distress
- If such a low has not been seen in two years, it will cause **more damage than a one-year low** — tellingly, traders call it a "cleanup," getting the "weak hands" out of the way
- A **"weak hand"** is someone who is fragile but doesn't know it, lulled by a false sense of security — when many weak hands rush to the door, they collectively cause crashes
- A **volatile market** doesn't let people go such a long time without a "cleanup" of risks, thereby preventing such market collapses

> *Fluctuat nec mergitur* (fluctuates, or floats, but does not sink) — Latin saying

### Hungry Donkeys

- So far we have argued that preventing randomness in an antifragile system is not always a good idea — now consider the situation in which **adding randomness** has been a standard operating method, as fuel for an antifragile system permanently hungry for it
- **Buridan's Donkey**: A donkey equally famished and thirsty, caught at an equal distance between food and water, would unavoidably die — but he can be saved by a **random nudge** one way or the other
- Named after the medieval philosopher **Jean de Buridan** — when systems are stuck in a dangerous impasse, **randomness and only randomness can unlock them**. Absence of randomness equals guaranteed death
- **Stochastic resonance**: adding random noise to the background makes you hear sounds with **more accuracy** — not just a psychological effect of overcompensation, but a physical property of the system
- Weak SOS signals too weak to be picked up by remote receptors can become audible in the presence of background noise — by adding random hiss to the signal, it rises above the threshold of detection. **Nothing in that situation does better than randomness, which comes for free**
- **Annealing** in metallurgy: a technique to make metal stronger and more homogeneous through the heating and controlled cooling of a material — the heat causes atoms to become unstuck from initial positions and wander randomly through states of higher energy; the cooling gives them more chances of finding new, **better configurations**
- Taleb's father would tap a wooden **barometer** every day upon coming home — the stress got the needle unstuck and allowed it to find its true equilibrium position. A local brand of antifragility
- Inspired by the metallurgical technique, mathematicians use **simulated annealing** — a computer simulation method to bring more general optimal solutions that only randomness can deliver
- **Nathan Myhrvold** brought to Taleb's attention a controversial 1975 paper in *Science* showing that **random drilling was superior to whatever search method** was being employed at the time
- Ironically, **chaotic systems** can be **stabilized by adding randomness** — a doctoral student showed balls jumping chaotically on a table in response to steady vibrations; then by adding random, low-intensity shocks, the jumps became orderly and smooth. The change from chaos to order came **not by removing chaos, but by adding randomness**

### Political Annealing

- It has been hard to explain to real people that stressors and uncertainty have their role in life — even harder to explain to **politicians**, yet this is where a dose of randomness is needed the most
- A film script about a city completely ruled by randomness (very Borgesian): the ruler randomly assigns denizens new roles at set intervals. People end up rebelling, asking for stability as their inalienable right
- Taleb's counter-proposal: instead of rulers randomizing jobs of citizens, **citizens should randomize the jobs of rulers** — naming them by raffles and removing them at random. Similar to simulated annealing
- The ancients were aware: members of the **Athenian assemblies were chosen by lot**, a method meant to protect the system from degeneracy
- In a computer simulation, **Alessandro Pluchino** and colleagues showed how adding **randomly selected politicians** can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system
- For **Voltaire**, the best form of government was the one tempered with political assassination — regicide is the equivalent of tapping on the barometer to make it work better, creating **often-needed reshuffling**
- The void created at the top allows the **annealing effect**, causing a new leader to emerge — the secular drop in premature deaths has deprived us of naturalistic managerial turnover
- Murder is the standard procedure for succession in the mafia (the last publicized annealing was when **John Gotti** murdered his predecessor in front of a New York steakhouse) — outside the mafia, bosses and board members now stay longer, impeding many domains. We need to **offset this with random lotteries**
- The problem in the United States is not the two-party system, but being stuck with the **same two parties** that don't have organic built-in expiration dates
- The ancients perfected the method of random draw and integrated it into **divinations** — the **sortes virgilianae** involved opening Virgil's *Aeneid* at random and interpreting the line as direction for action
- Taleb practices such randomizing heuristic in restaurants to avoid the **tyranny of choice** — blindly duplicating the selection of the most overweight male at the table; or randomly picking from the menu without reading the item, under the peace of mind that Baal made the choice for him

### That Time Bomb Called Stability

- Absence of fire lets highly flammable material accumulate — absence of political instability, even war, lets **explosive material and tendencies accumulate under the surface**

### The Second Step: Do (Small) Wars Save Lives?

- The anti-Enlightenment philosopher **Joseph de Maistre** remarked that conflicts strengthen countries — highly debatable, but his reasoning about the mistake of **analyzing losses from a given event and ignoring the rest of the story** is interesting and elegant
- We look at casualties as losses without taking into account the second step, what happens later — **unlike gardeners, who understand that pruning trees strengthens them**
- **Forced, constrained, non-natural peace** may be costly in lives — consider the great complacency that led to the Great War after almost a century of relative peace in Europe, coupled with the rise of the heavily armed nation-state
- We all love peace and stability — but do not want to be **suckers in the long term**. We seek vaccination (injecting harm to build immunity) but fail to transfer the mechanism to political and economic domains

### What to Tell the Foreign Policy Makers

- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system becomes extremely fragile — it is that, at the same time, **it exhibits no visible risks**. Volatility is information
- These systems tend to be too calm and exhibit **minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface**
- Although the stated intention of political leaders is to stabilize the system by inhibiting fluctuations, **the result tends to be the opposite** — these artificially constrained systems become prone to **Black Swans**
- Such environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone off guard — **the longer it takes for the blowup to occur, the worse the resulting harm**
- Seeking stability by achieving stability (and forgetting the second step) has been a **great sucker game** for economic and foreign policies
- Take rotten governments like the one in **Egypt** before the riots of 2011, supported by the United States for four decades "to avoid chaos" — identical to bankers using "too big to fail" status
- **Saudi Arabia** is the country that most worries Taleb — a standard case of top-down stability enforced by a superpower at the expense of every moral and ethical metric, and at the expense of stability itself
- A total monarchy, devoid of a constitution — between seven and fifteen thousand members of the royal family run the place, leading a lavish, hedonistic lifestyle in open contradiction with the purist ideas that got them there
- Look at the contradiction: the stern desert tribes whose legitimacy is derived from Amish-like austerity can, thanks to a superpower, turn to **hedonistic uninhibited pleasure seeking** — the king openly travels for pleasure with a retinue that fills four Jumbo jets. The family amassed a fortune now largely in Western safes
- Without the United States, the country would have had its revolution, a regional breakup, some turmoil, then perhaps some stability — **but preventing noise makes the problem worse in the long run**
- The **"alliance"** between the Saudi royal family and the United States was meant to provide stability — but "how long" is irrelevant: this stability is similar to a loan one has to eventually pay back
- Few people are aware that the bitterness of Iranians toward the United States comes from the fact that the U.S. installed the repressive **Shah of Iran**, who pillaged the place but gave the U.S. the "stability" of access to the Persian Gulf — the theocratic regime in Iran today is largely the result of such repression
- We need to learn to think in **second steps, chains of consequences, and side effects**
- U.S. policy toward the Middle East has historically, and especially since September 11, 2001, been unduly focused on the **repression of any and all political fluctuations** in the name of preventing "Islamic fundamentalism" — aside from the fact that killing Islamists compounds their numbers, forcing them underground strengthens them
- The more they intervene in other countries for the sake of stability, the more instability they bring (except for emergency-room-style cases)

> "One of life's packages: no stability without volatility."

### What Do We Call Here Modernity?

- Taleb's definition of **modernity**: humans' large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world's jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors
- Modernity corresponds to the systematic extraction of humans from their **randomness-laden ecology** — physical and social, even epistemological
- Modernity is not just the postmedieval, postagrarian, and postfeudal historical period — it is the spirit of an age marked by **rationalization (naive rationalism)**, the idea that society is understandable, hence must be designed, by humans
- With it was born statistical theory, the bell curve, the notion of **"efficiency"** — or optimization
- **Modernity is a Procrustean bed** — a reduction of humans to what appears efficient and useful. Some aspects work; some Procrustean beds may be beneficial, though these are rare
- Consider the life of the lion in the comfort and predictability of the **Bronx Zoo** (with Sunday visitors flocking to look at him in a combination of curiosity, awe, and pity) compared to that of his cousins in freedom — we once had free-range humans and free-range children before the advent of the soccer mom
- We are moving into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization (or rather reinvention of new sacred values like flags to replace altars), the tax man, fear of the boss, the separation of "work" and "leisure," the retirement plan, **smooth surfaces, and egocentric architects**
- **Violence is transferred from individuals to states. So is financial indiscipline.** At the center of all this is the denial of antifragility
- There is a dependence on narratives, an intellectualization of actions — public enterprises and functionaries can only do things that fit some narrative, unlike businesses that can just follow profits
- **You need a name for the color blue when you build a narrative, but not in action** — the thinker lacking a word for "blue" is handicapped; not the doer
- Modernity widened the difference between the sensational and the relevant — today we depend on the press for essentially human things as gossip and anecdotes, and we care about the private lives of people in very remote places
- In the past, when we were not fully aware of antifragility, we managed to respect these properties by constructing beliefs that served the purpose of managing and surviving uncertainty — we imparted improvements to the agency of **god(s)**. It was the gods that were the agents, **not Harvard-educated captains of the ship**
- The emergence of the **nation-state** falls squarely into this progression — the transfer of agency to mere humans. The story of the nation-state is that of the **concentration and magnification of human errors**
- **Modernity starts with the state monopoly on violence, and ends with the state's monopoly on fiscal irresponsibility**
- Next: Chapter 7 on naive interventionism, and Chapter 8 as transition to Book III on the unconditional belief in **scientific prediction** regardless of the domain

## Chapter 7: Naive Intervention

*A tonsillectomy to kill time — Never do today what can be left to tomorrow — Let's predict revolutions after they happen — Lessons in blackjack*

### The Tonsillectomy Example

- In the 1930s, **389 children** were presented to NYC doctors; 174 were recommended tonsillectomies. The remaining 215 were shown to another group — 99 were recommended surgery. The remaining 116 shown to yet a third group — 52 recommended. Each doctor recommends surgery at roughly the same rate regardless of need
- This illustrates **probabilistic homicide** — every unnecessary operation shortens a child's life expectancy. With morbidity of 2–4% and a death occurring every ~15,000 operations, you can calculate the break-even point between medical gains and detriment

### Intervention and Iatrogenics

- **Iatrogenics**: literally "caused by the healer" (*iatros* = healer in Greek) — damage from treatment in excess of the benefits
- Every time you visit a doctor, you incur risks that should be analyzed as **probabilistic benefits minus probabilistic costs**
- **George Washington's death** (December 1799): his doctors hastened it through the standard treatment of bloodletting (between five and nine pounds of blood)
- Until penicillin, medicine had a largely negative balance sheet — going to the doctor *increased* your chance of death
- Medical iatrogenics peaked in the late nineteenth century — "scientific progress" substituted clinics for home remedies, causing **"hospital fever."** Leibniz had called hospitals *seminaria mortis* (seedbeds of death)
- **Ignaz Semmelweis** observed more women died giving birth in hospitals than on the street — he called the establishment doctors criminals. Punished, humiliated, he ended up in an asylum and died ironically of the same hospital fever he had warned against

> "The final lesson is that one should not expect laurels for bringing the truth."

- Medical error still kills **between three and ten times** as many people as car accidents in the U.S.
- **Iatrogenics is compounded by the agency problem** — the stockbroker and doctor whose ultimate interest is their own checking account, not your financial or medical health

### First, Do No Harm

- *Primum non nocere* ("first do no harm") — attributed to Hippocrates, integrated into the Hippocratic Oath
- It took medicine about **twenty-four centuries** to properly execute this idea — the term "iatrogenics" only appeared in frequent use very recently
- **Generalized iatrogenics**: the concept should extend beyond medicine into political science, economics, urban planning, education — but not one consultant or academic in these fields recognized it when Taleb discussed it
- Anything with naive interventionism, nay, even just intervention, will have iatrogenics

### The Opposite of Iatrogenics

- No designation exists for someone who ends up helping while trying to cause harm — attacking the antifragile backfires
- **The Mel Brooks example**: In *The Producers*, two fellows tried to produce the worst possible play (*Springtime for Hitler*) — it was so bad it became a huge hit
- Perhaps capitalism is an **inverse-iatrogenic effect** — the system facilitates the conversion of selfish aims at the individual level into beneficial results for the collective

### Iatrogenics in High Places

- Two areas particularly infected: **socioeconomic life** and **the human body** — both with a historically high rate of intervention and a disrespect for spontaneous healing
- People with engineering-oriented minds treat everything as an engineering problem — but when dealing with cats (organic systems), hire veterinarians, not circuits engineers

### Table 3: Fragilizing Interventionism Across Disciplines

| Field | Interventionism | Iatrogenic Cost |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Medicine/Health | Overtreatment; denying body randomness; pharma addition not subtraction | Fragility; medical error; antibiotic-resistant bacteria |
| Ecology | Micromanaging forest fires | Worsening total risks — larger "big ones" |
| Politics | Central planning; supporting rotten regimes "for stability" | Informational opacity; chaos after revolution |
| Economics | "No More Boom and Bust"; state interventionism; optimization; value-at-risk | Fragility; deeper crises; stifling of entrepreneurs; big-time blowups |
| Business | Positive advice (charlatans), focus on return not risk | Richer charlatans, bankrupt businesses |
| Urbanism | City planning | Urban blight, inner cities, crime |
| Forecasting | Forecasting in Black Swan Domain despite horrible track record | Hidden risks (people take more risks with a forecast) |
| Literature | Copy editors trying to change your text | Blander, commoditized writing |
| Parenting | Soccer mom: removing every random element | Touristification of children's minds |
| Education | Entire concept grounded in interventionism | Ludification of children's brains |
| Technology | Neomania | Fragility, alienation, nerdification |
| Media | High-frequency sterile information | Disruption of signal filtering; interventionism |

### Can a Whale Fly Like an Eagle?

- Social scientists and economists have **no built-in consciousness of iatrogenics** — when Taleb tried to teach a class on model error, nobody took him seriously
- **A theory is a very dangerous thing to have** — one can do science without theory through *phenomenology* (observation of empirical regularity)
- In the Triad: **theories are superfragile** (they come and go); **phenomenologies are robust** (they stay)
- Physics is the exception — errors get smaller from theory to theory. In social science, theories *diverge* (Chicago laissez-faire vs. Moscow central planning — but their physics departments converged)
- Social science theories should be called **"chimeras"** rather than theories — they can blow us up (Extremistan effects vs. Mediocristan effects in physics)

### Not Doing Nothing

- **Alan Greenspan** was the "top economic iatrogenist of all time" — his attempt to iron out the boom-bust cycle caused risks to hide under the carpet and accumulate until they blew up the economy
- The same naive interventionism was applied by U.K.'s **Gordon Brown** — whose overt grand mission was to "eliminate" the business cycle
- Eliminating the business cycle leads to the **mother of all fragilities** — just as fire clears flammable material in a forest, small harm in the economy weeds out vulnerable firms early
- **Naive interventionism is pervasive**: a copy editor proposes ~5 changes per page. Accept corrections, give to another editor — same rate, sometimes reversing changes of the previous editor. Those who overedit tend to miss the real typos
- Interventionism **depletes mental and economic resources**; it is rarely available when needed most

### Non-Naive Interventionism

- The argument is not against intervention — it is against **naive** intervention and lack of awareness of harm
- Over-intervention comes with under-intervention — we tend to **over-intervene where benefits are minimal** while **under-intervening where intervention is necessary** (emergencies)
- **What should we control?** Intervening to limit *size*, *concentration*, and *speed* are beneficial in reducing Black Swan risks
- **The Drachten experiment**: a town in the Netherlands removed all street signs — deregulation led to an *increase* in safety, confirming the antifragility of attention whetted by danger and responsibility. Many German and Dutch towns have since reduced street signs
- Both markets and governments are unintelligent when it comes to Black Swan events — the ideas are **risk-management based**, not political

### In Praise of Procrastination — The Fabian Kind

- There is an element of **deceit associated with interventionism** — easier to sell "Look what I did for you" than "Look what I avoided for you"
- It is hard to observe *nonaction* — the doctor who refrains from surgery will not be rewarded the way the surgeon who "makes it look indispensable" is. The true hero in the Black Swan world **prevents a calamity** and gets no recognition for it
- **Fabius Maximus** ("the Procrastinator") — Roman general who drove Hannibal crazy by avoiding and delaying engagement, despite Hannibal's obvious military superiority
- The **Fabian Society** (George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell) — named after the Cunctator, based on opportunistically delaying revolution. Procrastination turned out to be a way to let events take their course and give activists a chance to change their minds before committing to irreversible policies
- Latin expression ***festina lente***: "make haste slowly." Lao Tzu coined the doctrine of ***wu-wei***: "passive achievement"
- **Procrastination is our natural defense** — letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility
- Taleb uses procrastination as a message from his inner self: "I write only if I feel like it and only on a subject I feel like writing about — and the reader is no fool"
- Procrastination **protects from error** as it gives nature a chance to do its job — nature is less error-prone than scientists
- Humans may have an instinct to procrastinate only when no life is in danger — one doesn't procrastinate when seeing a lion entering the bedroom
- The **naturalistic fallacy** — philosophers say what is natural is not necessarily morally right. But time is the best test of fragility — nature is the only system that has been stamped "robust" by time. However one slices it, it is not a fallacy when it comes to risk considerations

### Neuroticism in Industrial Proportions

- **Two personality types**: the neurotic vs. the imperturbable
- The **neurotic**: overreacts to everything, treats a small pimple as cancer, transforms every business setback into bankruptcy, turns every molehill into a mountain. The verb "overreact" was designed with him in mind — he does not have reactions, just overreactions
- The **imperturbable** (military commander, mafia godfather type): usually unruffled and immune to small information, calm and composed. When he *does* react, in the rare situations when he is angry, everyone knows it and takes it seriously
- The supply of information from modernity is transforming humans from the equable second fellow into the neurotic first one
- The difference between the two illustrates the difference between **noise** and **signal** — noise is what you are supposed to ignore; signal is what you need to heed

### A Legal Way to Kill People

- **If you want to accelerate someone's death, give him a personal doctor** — doctors need to justify their salaries, prove they have a work ethic; "doing nothing" doesn't satisfy. Michael Jackson's personal doctor was sued for overintervention-to-stifle-antifragility
- Why do very rich people with access to all medical care die just as easily as regular persons? It is *because* of overmedication and excessive medical care
- Those in corporations or policy making (like Greenspan) who are endowed with sophisticated data-gathering are capable of overreacting and **mistaking noise for information** — Greenspan tracked vacuum cleaner sales in Cleveland to "get a precise idea about where the economy is going," and of course he micromanaged us into chaos

### The Noise-to-Signal Ratio

- **The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you are disproportionally likely to get** (rather than the valuable part, called the signal); hence the higher the noise-to-signal ratio
- This confusion is not psychological — it is **inherent in the data itself**
- At a **yearly frequency**, the ratio of signal to noise is about one to one (half the changes are real improvements/degradations, half come from randomness)
- At a **daily frequency**, the composition changes to **95 percent noise, 5 percent signal**
- At an **hourly frequency**, it becomes **99.5 percent noise to 0.5 percent signal** — two hundred times more noise than signal
- **Anyone who listens to news** (except when very significant events take place) is one step below sucker
- **Newspapers as iatrogenics**: they need to fill their pages every day — they ought to keep silent in the absence of news of significance. Newspapers should be two-line length on some days, two hundred pages on others — in proportion with the intensity of the signal. And junk food is iatrogenic
- **Too much information is too much stress** — exceeding the threshold of antifragility. Just as too much food confuses your biology, too much data (particularly when sterile) causes statistics to become meaningless
- The best solution is to *only* look at very large changes in data or conditions, never at small ones — just as we are not likely to mistake a bear for a stone (but likely to mistake a stone for a bear)

### Media-Driven Neuroticism

- The media glorifies the anecdote — every day **6,200 persons die** in the U.S. from preventable causes, but the media only reports the most sensational (hurricanes, freak accidents, small plane crashes), giving a distorted map of real risks
- In an ancestral environment, the anecdote ("the interesting") was information; today, no longer
- The media induces an **illusion of understanding** the world by presenting us with explanations and theories
- Understanding of events by the press is so retrospective that they would **put security checks after the plane ride** — *post bellum auxilium* (sending troops after the battle)
- To conclude, **the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information**, as naturalistically as possible — the more data you get, the less you know what's going on, and the more iatrogenics you will cause

### The State Can Help — When Incompetent

- The **Chinese famine** (1959–1961) that killed 30 million: researchers Xin Meng, Nancy Qian, and Pierre Yared found that famine was *more severe* in areas with higher food production before the famine began — government food distribution policy was behind much of the problem
- **Soviet inefficiency as accidental robustness**: after the Soviet breakdown, calamities were avoided *because* food production was inefficient and full of unintentional redundancies. Every town had the staples growing around it. Unlike the U.S. which burns twelve calories in transportation for every calorie of nutrition, in Soviet Russia it was one to one
- The top-down state is not necessarily the one that has the reputation of being so

### France Is Messier than You Think

- France works well **not because** it is a Cartesian rationalist top-down state — but because the French were lucky that centralization was a failed aim for a long time
- **Graham Robb's** *The Discovery of France*: The nation-state in France was largely nominal — in 1863 only one in five persons spoke French; the country had hundreds of languages and dialects. The Nobel Prize in Literature in 1904 went to **Frédéric Mistral**, who wrote in Provençal
- Paris was barely controlled by France — Louis XIV moved the government to Versailles to escape the Parisian crowd. Paris only became controllable after Haussmann in the 1860s replaced narrow streets with large avenues for police crowd control
- France might have benefited from its brief period under a large centralized state — but the argument could equally be that it benefited from the happy condition that the large state did not overstay its welcome

### Sweden and the Large State

- Nordic states (Sweden, Denmark) are often offered as paragons of the large state "that works" — but the political scientist **Mark Blyth** showed this was a false narrative
- Almost the same story as Switzerland — the state exists as a tax collector, but the money is **spent in the communes**, directed by the communes. Skills training is locally determined. The economic elites have more freedom than in most other democracies — far from the statism one can assume from the outside
- Nordic countries experienced a severe recession at the end of the cold war (~1990) and responded with **fiscal toughness**, effectively shielding them from the severe financial crisis two decades later

### Catalyst-as-Cause Confusion

- When constrained systems collapse, failure is never seen as the result of fragility — rather, it is interpreted as a product of poor forecasting
- It would be unintelligent to attribute the collapse of a fragile bridge to the last truck that crossed it — and even more foolish to try to predict which truck might bring it down
- In **2011**, Obama blamed an intelligence failure for not foreseeing the Egyptian revolution — just as Carter had blamed intelligence for not foreseeing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. Missing the point: it is the **suppressed risk** in the statistical "tails" that matters, not the failure to see the last grain of sand
- Obama's mistake illustrates the **illusion of local causal chains** — confusing catalysts for causes and assuming one can know which catalyst will produce which effect
- **The Arab Spring** riots in Tunisia and Egypt were attributed to rising commodity prices — but Bahrain and Libya were wealthy countries that could afford grain. Also, commodity prices had been considerably higher a few years earlier without any uprising. The focus is wrong: **it is the system and its fragility, not events**, that must be studied
- No matter how many dollars are spent on research, predicting revolutions is not the same as counting cards — humans will never turn politics and economics into the tractable randomness of blackjack

## Chapter 8: Prediction as a Child of Modernity

*Never shout in French — Ms. Bré gains in respect — Black Swan territory*

- In fall 2009, Taleb found himself in Korea at a panel with **Takatoshi Kato**, deputy managing director of a powerful international institution, who presented economic projections for 2010–2014
- Taleb flew into a rage in front of two thousand Koreans — ran to the podium and told the audience that the next time someone gives them projections, they should ask him to show **what he had projected in the past** (in this case, what he had been forecasting for 2008 and 2009 two to five years earlier)
- Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is **not close to zero; it is *zero***
- Taleb improvised his solution on the spot: we can't put false predictors in jail; we can't stop people from asking for predictions — but we can live in a world where predictions like Kato's **do not harm you**. Such a world has a unique attribute: **robustness**
- The idea of the **Triad** was born there: **Fragility–Robustness–Antifragility** as a replacement for predictive methods

### Ms. Bré Has Competitors

- Forecasting is **not neutral** — it is iatrogenic. It can be downright injurious to risk-takers, no different from giving people snake oil medicine instead of cancer treatment, or **bleeding** (as with George Washington)
- **Danny Kahneman** stoked Taleb's frustration by showing the evidence of iatrogenics: providing someone with a random numerical forecast **increases his risk taking**, even if the person *knows* the projections are random
- The next step is obvious yet rarely taken: **avoidance of iatrogenics from forecasting** — we understand childproofing, but not **forecaster-hubris-proofing**

### The Predictive

- The robust and antifragile **don't need as accurate a comprehension of the world** as the fragile — they do not need forecasting
- **Redundancy** is a nonpredictive, or rather less predictive, mode of action: if you have extra cash in the bank (plus cans of Spam, hummus, and gold bars in the basement), you don't need to know with precision which event will cause difficulties — war, recession, epidemic, terrorist attack, the secession of New Jersey — you do not need to predict much
- Those in the opposite situation — **in debt** — because of their fragility, need to predict with more and more accuracy
- You can control **fragility** a lot more than you think. Three refined points:
  1. **Detecting (anti)fragility** — smelling it, as Fat Tony will show — is easier than prediction. The entire mission reduces to: minimize harm and maximize gain from forecasting errors — have things that don't fall apart, or even benefit, when we make a mistake
  2. We do not want to change the world for now; we should first **make things more robust to defects and forecast errors**, or even exploit these errors — making lemonade out of the lemons
  3. History is in the business of making it out of lemons; **antifragility is how things move forward** under the mother of all stressors, called time
- After an event, we must switch the blame from inability to see it coming to the failure to understand (anti)fragility — **"why did we build something so fragile?"** Not seeing a tsunami or economic event coming is excusable; **building something fragile to them is not**
- As to naive utopianism (blindness to history): we cannot afford to rely on the rationalistic elimination of greed and other human defects that fragilize society — humanity has been trying for thousands of years and humans remain the same, **plus or minus bad teeth**. The more intelligent action is to make the world **greed-proof**, or even make society benefit from the greed
- After Fukushima, intelligent nuclear firms are now focusing on **exposure to failure** — building small enough reactors, embedded deep enough, with enough protection layers that a failure would not affect us much. Making the prediction or nonprediction of failure quite irrelevant. Costly, but still better than nothing
- The **Swedish government's** focus on total fiscal responsibility after their 1991 budget troubles makes them much **less dependent on economic forecasts** — allowing them to shrug off later crises

### The Idea of Becoming a Non-Turkey

- We can put a man on the moon, predict the trajectory of planets, predict the most minute effect in quantum physics — yet governments with equally sophisticated models **cannot forecast revolutions, crises, budget deficits, climate change**, or even the closing price of the stock market a few hours from now
- There are **two different domains**: one in which we can predict (to some extent), and the other — the **Black Swan domain** — in which we should only let turkeys and turkified people operate
- The demarcation is as visible as the one between **the cat and the washing machine** — social, economic, and cultural life lie in the Black Swan domain, physical life much less so
- The idea is to separate domains where Black Swans are both **unpredictable and consequential** from those where rare events are either predictable or inconsequential

> "Randomness in the Black Swan domain is intractable. I will repeat it till I get hoarse. The limit is mathematical, period, and there is no way around it on this planet."

- What is nonmeasurable and nonpredictable will remain so, no matter how many PhDs with Russian and Indian names you put on the job — there is, in the Black Swan zone, a **limit to knowledge** that can never be reached
- Taleb's work is about ***where* one should be skeptical** — focus on getting out of the **Fourth Quadrant** (the scientific name for the Black Swan domain where we have high exposure to rare, "tail" events *and* these events are incomputable)
- Because of modernity, the share of **Extremistan is increasing** — winner-take-all effects are worsening. Success for an author, a company, an idea, a musician, an athlete is **planetary, or nothing**. These worsen predictability since almost everything in socioeconomic life is now dominated by Black Swans
- Our sophistication continuously puts us ahead of ourselves, **creating things we are less and less capable of understanding**

### No More Black Swans

- The world has also gone the other way upon the discovery of the Black Swan idea: **opportunists** are now predicting, predictioning, and predictionizing Black Swans with even more complicated models from chaos-complexity-catastrophe-fractal theory
- Yet the answer is simple: ***less is more*** — move the discourse to **(anti)fragility**

## Chapter 9: Fat Tony and the Fragilistas

### On Suckers and Nonsuckers

- After the 2008 crisis, it became clear what Fat Tony and Nero had in common: they were predicting a **sucker's fragility crisis**
- They had both been convinced that a crisis of such magnitude — a snowballing destruction of the modern economic system on a scale never seen before — was bound to happen **simply because there were suckers**
- Fat Tony believed that **nerds, administrators, and mostly bankers** were the ultimate suckers — when everyone still thought they were geniuses
- He believed they were **collectively even bigger suckers** than they were individually, and he had a natural ability to detect them before they fell apart
- Fat Tony derived his income from detecting suckers while leading a life of leisure
- Nero's interests were similar to Tony's, except dressed up in intellectual traditions — to Nero, a system built on **illusions of understanding probability** is bound to collapse
- By **betting against fragility**, they were antifragile
- Tony made a bundle from the crisis, in the high eight to low nine figures — everything other than a bundle for Tony is "tawk"
- Nero made a bit, though much less than Tony, but was satisfied that he had won — he had already been financially independent and saw money as a waste of time
- Nero's family wealth had **peaked in 1804**, so he did not have the social insecurity of other adventurers — money to him could not possibly be a social statement, only erudition and perhaps wisdom in old age
- **Excess wealth** is a heavy burden — nothing was more hideous in Nero's eyes than excessive refinement in clothes, food, lifestyle, manners
- Wealth was **nonlinear** — beyond some level it forces people into endless complications, creating worries about whether the housekeeper is scamming them

### Ethics of Betting Against Suckers

- The ethics of betting against suckers are discussed in Book VII — two schools of thought
- To Nero, one should first **warn people that they are suckers**, while Tony was against the very notion of warning
- > "You will be ridiculed. Words are for sissies. A system based on verbal warnings will be dominated by non-risk-taking-babblers. These people won't give you and your ideas respect unless you take their money."
- Fat Tony insisted that Nero take a **ritual look at the physical embodiments of the spoils** — such as a bank account statement — not for the financial value, nor the purchasing power, just the **symbolic value**
- He could understand why Julius Caesar needed Vercingetorix, the leader of the Gaul rebellion, brought to Rome and **paraded in chains** — to exhibit victory in the flesh

### Dependence on External Recognition

- There is another dimension to focusing on **actions over words**: the health-eroding dependence on external recognition
- People are cruel and unfair in how they confer recognition, so it is best to **stay out of that game** — stay robust to how others treat you
- Nero befriended a scientist of legendary status who spent his time **focused on the status** he had that week in the scientific community, becoming enraged at authors who did not cite him or committees granting medals to people he judged inferior — an impostor!
- Those who depend on words for serenity remain **fragile to the emotional toll** from compliments they did *not* get, the ones others got, and from what someone of lower intellect stole from them
- Nero promised himself to escape this with his small ritual — the **"Fat Tony bet"**: after deducting the cost of a new car (a Mini) and a new $60 Swatch watch, his spoils amounted to a dizzyingly large amount sitting in a portfolio
- It is not the amount but the **tangibility of his action** that counted — the quantities could have been a tenth, even a hundredth, and the effect would remain the same
- He would cure himself of the game of recognition by **opening the envelope containing the statement** and then going on with his day, oblivious to those cruel and unfair users of words

### Honor and Risk-Taking

- To follow ethics to their natural conclusion, Nero should have felt just as proud had the envelope contained statements of **losses**
- > "A man is honorable in proportion to the personal risks he takes for his opinion — in other words, the amount of downside he is exposed to."
- To sum him up, Nero believed in **erudition, aesthetics, and risk taking** — little else

### Charity

- To avoid the **charity trap**, Nero followed Fat Tony's rule of systematically making donations, but **not to those who directly asked for gifts**
- He never gave a penny to any charitable organization, with the possible exception of those in which not a single person earned a salary

### Loneliness

- Before the 2008 crisis, Nero sometimes experienced pain at being alone with his ideas — wondering on Sunday nights if there was something wrong with him or the world
- Lunch with Fat Tony was like **drinking water after an episode of thirst** — immediate relief to realize he was either not crazy, or at least not *alone* in being crazy
- Things out there *did not make sense*, and it was impossible to convey it to others, particularly people deemed intelligent
- Of the close to a million professionals employed in economic activities — government, academia, media, banking, corporations — **fewer than a handful saw the crisis coming**, and an even smaller handful managed to foresee the full extent of the damage
- Not a single one realized that the crisis was a **product of modernity**
- Nero could stand near the former World Trade Center site in downtown New York, across from colossal buildings housing banks and brokerage houses, with hundreds of people running around inside — all producing **noise**: wasted effort, cacophony, unaesthetic behavior, increased entropy
- The large-scale delusion of "wealth" was bound to evaporate somehow
- You could stack the books and they would constitute an entire mountain — to Nero anything in them that deals with probability, statistics, or mathematical models is just **air**
- > "You learn more in a few lunches with Fat Tony than from the social science sections of the Harvard libraries, with close to two million books and research papers, for a total of 33 million hours of reading."
- Talk about a major **sucker problem**

### What the Nonpredictor Can Predict

- Fat Tony did not believe in predictions, but he made big bucks **predicting that some people — the predictors — would go bust**
- Nero used to meet physicists from the Santa Fe Institute who believed in predictions and used fancy prediction models — their business ventures based on predictions did not do well, while Fat Tony, who did not believe in predictions, **got rich from prediction**
- You can't predict in general, but you can predict that those who rely on predictions are taking more risks, will have some trouble, **perhaps even go bust**
- Someone who predicts will be **fragile to prediction errors** — an overconfident pilot will eventually crash the plane, and numerical prediction leads people to take more risks
- Fat Tony is **antifragile** because he takes a mirror image of his fragile prey
- Fat Tony's model is quite simple: he **identifies fragilities**, makes a bet on the collapse of the fragile unit, lectures Nero, trades insults with him about sociocultural matters, reacting to Nero's jabs at New Jersey life, **collects big after the collapse**, then has lunch

---

## Chapter 10: Seneca's Upside and Downside

*How to survive advice — To lose nothing or gain nothing — What to do on your next shipwreck*

- A couple of millennia before Fat Tony, another child of the Italian peninsula solved the problem of antifragility — **Seneca**, the stoic philosopher
- Seneca was more intellectual than Fat Tony, spoke in more distinguished prose, and was no less successful in the real world — actually he was **vastly more successful in business** than Fat Tony, and no less intellectual than Nero
- He solved the problem of antifragility — what connects the elements of the **Triad** — using Stoic philosophy

### Is This Really Serious?

- **Lucius Annaeus Seneca** was a philosopher who happened to be the wealthiest person in the Roman Empire, partly owing to his trading acumen, partly for having served as the tutor of Emperor Nero
- Seneca subscribed to and was a prominent expositor of the philosophical school of **Stoicism**, which advanced a certain indifference to fate
- His work seduced people because he **walked the walk** — he focused on the practical aspect of Stoicism: how to take a trip, how to handle oneself while committing suicide, how to handle adversity and poverty, and critically, **wealth**
- Because Seneca was into practical decision making, he has been described by academics as **not theoretical or philosophical enough** — yet not a single one of his commentators detected the ideas about asymmetry central to this book, and the key to robustness and antifragility
- **Wisdom in decision making** is vastly more important — not just practically, but philosophically — than knowledge
- Other philosophers came to practice from theory — Aristotle provided practical advice, Plato's ideas about the state and advice to rulers (particularly the ruler of Syracuse) were either **ineffectual or caused debacles**
- To become a successful philosopher king, it is much better to **start as a king than as a philosopher**

### The Story of Professor Triffat

- Modern members of the discipline of **decision theory** travel a one-way road from theory to practice — they gravitate to the most complicated but inapplicable problems, calling it "doing science"
- Professor Triffat, a highly cited academic in decision theory, wrote the main textbook and helped develop **"rational decision making"** — loaded with grand and useless axioms and probabilities
- Triffat was agonizing over the decision to accept an appointment at Harvard — many people who talk about risk never encounter difficult risk-taking decisions like this
- When a colleague suggested he use **"maximum expected utility"** to decide, Triffat angrily responded: "Come on, this is serious!"
- By contrast, Seneca is nothing but "this is serious" — he once survived a shipwreck in which other family members perished, and he wrote letters of practical advice to his friends
- When Seneca took his own life, he followed excellently and in a dignified way the principles he preached
- While the Harvard economist is only read by people trying to write papers, **Seneca is still read by real people two millennia after his passing**

### Less Downside from Life

- Seneca's fortune was **three hundred million denarii** (Judas got thirty denarii, the equivalent of a month's salary, to betray Jesus)
- It is not convincing to read denigrations of material wealth from a fellow writing on tables with ivory legs
- The traditional understanding of Stoicism is of some *indifference* to fate — about continuously degrading the value of earthly possessions
- When **Zeno of Kition**, the founder of Stoicism, suffered a shipwreck, he declared himself lucky to be unburdened so he could now do philosophy
- The key phrase reverberating in Seneca's oeuvre is **_nihil perditi_**: "I lost nothing" after an adverse event
- Stoicism makes you desire the challenge of a calamity — Stoics look down on luxury

> "He is in debt, whether he borrowed from another person or from fortune."

- Stoicism seen this way becomes **pure robustness** — the attainment of a state of immunity from one's external circumstances, good or bad, and an absence of fragility to decisions made by fate
- Random events won't affect us either way (we are too strong to lose, and not greedy to enjoy the upside), so we stay in the **middle column of the Triad**
- But reading Seneca directly reveals a different story — Seneca's version of Stoicism is **antifragility from fate**: no downside from Lady Fortuna, plenty of upside
- Seneca's aim on paper was philosophical — Stoicism was not supposed to be about gains and benefits, just a **sense of control** over one's fate and the reduction of psychological fragility
- But if wealth is so much of a burden while unnecessary, what's the point of having it? **Why did Seneca keep it?**
- Intellectuals have this thing against antifragility — for them the world tends to stop at robustness. They avoid considering that **Seneca wanted the upside from fate**, and there is nothing wrong with it
- Three steps: (1) learn how Seneca advocated the **mitigation of downside** — robustness, protection against harm from emotions, how to move away from the first column of the Triad; (2) show how he truly proposed **antifragility**; (3) generalize his trick into a general method of detection of antifragility

### Stoicism's Emotional Robustification

- Success brings an asymmetry: you now have **a lot more to lose than to gain** — you are hence fragile (like the story of Damocles' sword)
- When you become rich, the **pain of losing** your fortune exceeds the emotional gain of getting additional wealth — you start living under continuous emotional threat
- A rich person becomes trapped by belongings that take control of him — degrading his sleep, raising stress hormones, diminishing his sense of humor
- Seneca fathomed that possessions make us worry about **downside**, thus acting as a punishment as we depend on them — all upside, no downside
- Dependence on circumstances — rather, the emotions that arise from circumstances — induces **a form of slavery**
- This asymmetry between good and bad effects was known to the ancients — Livy wrote:

> "Men feel the good less intensely than the bad" (*segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt*)

- The ancients — mostly thanks to Seneca — stay **way ahead of modern psychologists** and Triffat-style decision theorists who have developed theories around "risk (or loss) aversion"; the ancients remain deeper, more practical, while transcending vulgar therapy

### The Domestication of Emotions

- Stoicism is about the **domestication**, not necessarily the elimination, of emotions — not about turning humans into vegetables
- The modern Stoic sage is *someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking*
- Seneca proposes a complete **training program** to handle life and use emotions properly — thanks to small but effective tricks
- One trick: a Roman Stoic would use to **separate anger from rightful action** — to avoid committing harm he would regret later, he would wait at least a day before beating a servant who committed a violation
- Compare this to Emperor Hadrian's act of stabbing a slave in the eye during uncontrolled anger — when the anger abated, the damage was **irreversible**
- Seneca also provides a catalogue of social deeds: **invest in good actions** — things can be taken from us, but not good deeds and acts of virtue

### How to Become the Master

- So far we have learned to move from the left of the Triad (fragile) to the center (robust) — but **Seneca went beyond**
- He said that wealth is the **slave of the wise man and master of the fool** — thus he broke with the purported Stoic habit: *he kept the upside*
- If previous Stoics claimed to prefer poverty to wealth, we need to be suspicious — since most were poor, they might have fit a narrative to the circumstances (the notion of **sour grapes**: cognitive games to make yourself believe the grapes you can't reach taste sour)
- Seneca was all deeds, and we cannot ignore that he **kept the wealth** — it is central that he showed his preference of wealth *without harm from wealth* to poverty
- Seneca even outlined his strategy in *De beneficiis*, explicitly calling it a cost-benefit analysis using the word **"bookkeeping"**:

> "The bookkeeping of benefits is simple: it is all expenditure; if any one returns it, that is clear gain; if he does not return it, it is not lost, I gave it for the sake of giving."

- So he played a trick on fate: **kept the good and ditched the bad** — cut the downside and kept the upside
- This cost-benefit analysis is not quite Stoicism in the way people who study Stoicism understand the meaning — there is an **upside-downside asymmetry**
- That's **antifragility in its purest form**

### The Foundational Asymmetry

- The concept used earlier is *more to lose* from adversity — if you have more to lose than to benefit from events of fate, there is an asymmetry, and not a good one, which **brings us to fragility**
- The fragile package from Chapter 1: it does not like to be shaken and hates the members of the disorder family — hence it is fragile (very asymmetric) because it has **absolutely nothing to gain**
- The antifragile package has **more to gain than to lose** from being shaken — simple test: if I have "nothing to lose" then it is all gain and I am antifragile
- The entire Table 1 with triads across fields and domains can be explained in these terms
- If you have **less to lose than to gain**, more upside than downside, then you like volatility (it will, on balance, bring benefits), and you are also antifragile

> *Fragility implies more to lose than to gain, equals more downside than upside, equals (unfavorable) asymmetry*

> *Antifragility implies more to gain than to lose, equals more upside than downside, equals (favorable) asymmetry*

- You are **antifragile for a source of volatility** if potential gains exceed potential losses (and vice versa)
- If you have more upside than downside, then you may be **harmed by lack of volatility and stressors**
- The practical question: how do we put this idea — reduction of downside, increase in upside — into practice? By the method of the **barbell** in the next chapter

---

## Chapter 11: Never Marry the Rock Star

*A precise protocol on how and with whom to cheat on one's husband — Introduction to barbell strategies — Transforming diplomats into writers, and vice versa*

- The **barbell (or bimodal) strategy** is a way to achieve antifragility and move to the right side of the Triad
- Monogamous birds put it into practice by cheating with the local rock star, and writers do better by having a day job (a sinecure) devoid of writing activities

### On the Irreversibility of Broken Packages

- The first step toward antifragility consists in **first decreasing downside** rather than increasing upside — by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans and letting natural antifragility work by itself
- **Mitigating fragility** is not an option but a requirement — it may sound obvious but the point seems to be missed
- Fragility is very punishing, like a terminal disease — a package doesn't break under adverse conditions then manage to fix itself when proper conditions are restored
- Fragility has a **ratchetlike property**: the irreversibility of damage — what matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination — what scientists call a **path-dependent** property
- Path dependence illustrated: your experience in getting a kidney stone operation first and anesthesia later is different from the opposite sequence; a meal with coffee and dessert first and tomato soup last would not be the same as the inverse order
- It is easy to identify the fragile and put it in the **left column of the Triad** — since the broken will tend to stay permanently broken
- This fragility from path dependence is often ignored by businessmen trained in static thinking — they believe generating profits is their principal mission, with survival and risk control as something to "perhaps consider"
- The strong logical precedence of **survival over success**: to make profits and buy a BMW, it would be a good idea to, first, survive
- Notions such as **speed and growth** are empty and meaningless when presented without accounting for fragility — someone driving 250 mph in New York City will certainly never get anywhere (effective speed: zero miles per hour)
- One needs to focus on the **effective**, not the nominal — speed, growth, something in sociopolitical discourse masks such an elementary point

### Path Dependence and Economic Growth

- Under path dependence, one can no longer separate **growth from risks of recession**, financial returns from risks of terminal losses, and "efficiency" from danger of accident
- The notion of efficiency becomes quite meaningless on its own — if a gambler has a risk of terminal blowup (losing back everything), the "potential returns" of his strategy are **totally inconsequential**
- A university fellow boasted that their endowment fund was earning 20 percent or so, not realizing these returns were associated with fragilities that would easily turn into catastrophic losses — sure enough, a bad year **wiped out all these returns**
- If something is fragile, its risk of breaking makes anything you do to improve it or make it "efficient" inconsequential unless you **first reduce that risk of breaking**
- > "Nothing can be done both hastily and safely — almost nothing." — Publilius Syrus
- GDP growth can be obtained easily by loading future generations with **debt** — and the future economy may collapse upon the need to repay it
- GDP growth, like cholesterol, seems to be a **Procrustean bed reduction** that has been used to game systems
- For a plane with a high risk of crashing, the notion of "speed" is irrelevant — economic growth with fragilities is **not to be called growth**
- Throughout the golden years of the Industrial Revolution, growth was very modest — **less than 1 percent per head** — but as low as it was, it was **robust growth**, unlike the current fools' race of states shooting for growth like teenage drivers infatuated with speed

### Seneca's Barbell

- This brings us to the solution in the form of a **barbell** — about all solutions to uncertainty are in the form of barbells
- The barbell (a bar with weights on both ends) is meant to illustrate the idea of a **combination of extremes kept separate**, with avoidance of the middle
- In our context it is not necessarily symmetric: just **composed of two extremes**, with nothing in the middle — also called a bimodal strategy, with two distinct modes rather than a single central one
- The barbell image describes a dual attitude of **playing it safe in some areas** (robust to negative Black Swans) and **taking a lot of small risks in others** (open to positive Black Swans), hence achieving antifragility
- That is **extreme risk aversion on one side** and **extreme risk loving on the other**, rather than just the "medium" or the beastly "moderate" risk attitude that in fact is a sucker game (because medium risks can be subjected to huge measurement errors)
- The barbell also results in the **reduction of downside risk** — the elimination of the risk of ruin

### The Barbell in Finance

- If you put **90 percent of your funds in boring cash** (assuming you are protected from inflation) or something called a "numeraire repository of value," and **10 percent in very risky, maximally risky securities**, you cannot possibly lose more than 10 percent, while you are exposed to massive upside
- Someone with 100 percent in so-called "medium" risk securities has a **risk of total ruin** from the miscomputation of risks
- The barbell technique remedies the problem that risks of rare events are **incomputable and fragile to estimation error** — here the financial barbell has a **maximum known loss**
- For antifragility, the combination is **aggressiveness plus paranoia** — clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside (the positive Black Swans) take care of itself
- Seneca's asymmetry: more upside than downside can come simply from the **reduction of extreme downside** (emotional harm) rather than improving things in the middle

### Barbells vs. Nonbarbells

- A barbell can be **any dual strategy composed of extremes**, without corruption of the middle — somehow they all result in favorable asymmetries
- Consider that restaurants present the main course (steak cooked rare with Malbec wine), then separately, the goat cheese cake (with Muscat wine) — they do not cut the cake and steak into small pieces and mix them together; activities "in the middle" are like such **mashing**
- Recall Nero in Chapter 9 hanging around with **janitors and scholars**, rarely with middlebrows
- In risky matters, instead of having all members of a staff "cautiously optimistic" or something in the middle, have the **flight attendants maximally optimistic** and the **pilot maximally pessimistic** (or better, paranoid)

### The Accountant and the Rock Star

- Biological systems are replete with barbell strategies — the **90 percent accountant, 10 percent rock star** mating approach
- Females in some monogamous species (including humans) tend to marry the **accountant** (someone stable who can provide) and once in a while cheat with the **aggressive alpha, the rock star**, as part of a dual strategy
- They **limit their downside** while using extrapair copulation to get the genetic upside, or some great fun, or both
- Even the timing of the cheating seems nonrandom, corresponding to **periods with high likelihood of pregnancy**
- Evidence from so-called monogamous birds: they enjoy cheating, with more than a tenth of the broods coming from **males other than the putative father**
- Evolutionary theorists claim females want both **economic-social stability and good genes** for their children — both cannot always be obtained from someone in the middle
- Recall from Chapter 2 that overcompensation requires **some harm and stressors as tools of discovery** — let children play a little bit with fire and learn from injuries, for the sake of their own future safety
- Let people experience **some stress** to wake them up a bit — but at the same time, they need to be protected from high danger
- Ignore small dangers, invest your energy in protecting them from **consequential harm — and only consequential harm**
- This can visibly be translated into social policy, health care, and many more matters

### Provide for the Worst

- One finds similar ideas in ancestral lore — a Yiddish proverb:

> "Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself."

- This may sound like a platitude, but it is not: just observe how people tend to **provide for the best** and hope that the worst will take care of itself
- We have ample evidence that people are averse to small losses but **not so much toward very large Black Swan risks** (which they underestimate) — they tend to insure for small probable losses, but not large infrequent ones — **exactly backwards**

### Away from the Golden Middle

- There are so many fields in which the middle is no "golden middle" and where the **bimodal strategy** (maximally safe plus maximally speculative) applies
- Take **literature** — the most uncompromising, most speculative, most demanding, and riskiest of all careers
- There is a tradition with French and other European literary writers to look for a **sinecure** — the anxiety-free profession of civil servant, with few intellectual demands and high job security — then spend their spare time writing freely, whatever they want, under their own standards
- There is a shockingly small number of academics among French authors
- American writers, on the other hand, tend to become members of the media or academics, which **makes them prisoners of a system and corrupts their writing**

*Chapters 12–15 — How to get more upside than downside without understanding the future*

---

## Chapter 12: Thales' Sweet Grapes

*Options — The rational flâneur — How America got rich — Thales' olive presses — Sweet grapes vs. sour grapes*

### The Teleological Fallacy

- The **teleological fallacy**: the illusion that you know exactly where you are going, that you knew exactly where you were going in the past, and that others have succeeded in the past by knowing where they were going
- **Narrative fallacy in reverse**: we construct a clear, purposeful story after the fact, but the actual path was full of wandering and accidental discovery
- Almost all important innovations and discoveries came from **serendipity and tinkering**, not from directed, planned research

### The Rational Flâneur

- The **rational flâneur** (or the non-narrative, opportunistic person): someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision at every step to revise his schedule based on new information
- The tourist has a fixed itinerary; the flâneur responds to the environment — this is optionality in its purest form
- **Steve Jobs** was a rational flâneur: his strength was distrusting market research and focus groups, instead relying on option-like tinkering and letting the outcome reveal itself
- Business plans are dangerous precisely because they lock you into a fixed narrative and prevent flânerie

### America's Principal Asset

- America's principal asset is not resources, education, or technology — it is **risk taking and optionality**
- The culture of trial-and-error with **no shame in failing** — this generates the antifragile tinkering that produces innovation
- American risk-taking culture functions as a giant option: small, bounded downside (a failed business, move on) with massive, potentially unlimited upside
- Compare to countries with shame-based cultures around failure: they suppress the very optionality that drives progress

### Thales of Miletus

- **Thales** put down a payment (a deposit) on olive presses before harvest season — the first recorded **option contract** in history
- If the harvest was poor, he lost his small deposit (known, bounded loss). If the harvest was great, he controlled the presses and could rent them at a premium (large, open-ended gain)
- This is a **pure option**: the right but not the obligation to do something. Limited loss, large possible outcome
- Aristotle missed the financial insight entirely, interpreting the story as Thales proving philosophers could be rich if they wanted — missing the asymmetry of the payoff

### Options Are Agents of Antifragility

- An **option** = asymmetry + rationality: you keep the favorable outcomes and let the unfavorable ones go
- "The right but not the obligation" — this is the core of antifragility in any domain
- You need the **rationality** to exercise the option: recognize a good outcome when you see it, and keep it. Discard the bad
- Options benefit from volatility and uncertainty — exactly like antifragile systems

### The Option of Sweet Grapes

- **Financial independence** gives you the ultimate option: the freedom to pursue what you want
- In Aesop's fable, the fox who can't reach the grapes calls them sour — **sour grapes** is rationalizing the inability to access something desirable
- Thales' version is **sweet grapes**: he genuinely chose philosophy over wealth, having proven he could be rich. His poverty was a choice made from a position of strength, not weakness
- The key distinction: someone who *could* be rich but chooses not to be is in a fundamentally different position from someone who *can't* be rich and rationalizes their poverty

### Saturday Evening in London / Your Rent

- **Embedded options in daily life**: a Saturday evening in London — you have an *option*, not an obligation, to go to a gathering. Small downside (a taxi ride), big upside (might meet someone wonderful). These free options are everywhere
- **Rent-controlled apartment**: you have the option to stay as long as you wish, but no obligation. If rents rise, you're protected. If rents fall, you can leave and get a cheaper place. **Uncertainty increases the value of the option** — the more volatile the housing market, the more valuable your rent-controlled lease
- The key insight: options that are embedded and hidden (not traded on an exchange) tend to be **underpriced or free** because people don't recognize them

### Asymmetry

- Thales' payoff graph (Figure 5): limited loss on the downside, unlimited gains on the upside — a **nonlinear** asymmetry
- **Asymmetry is a form of nonlinearity** — the payoff is larger one way than the other. This is the visual signature of antifragility

### Things That Like Dispersion

- Options don't care about the average outcome — they care only about the **favorable tail**. The downside doesn't count beyond a certain point
- For authors and ideas: better to have a small number of **fanatical** supporters than a large number of lukewarm ones. The people who dislike your work don't count — there's no "negative" of buying a book
- **Luxury goods industry** doesn't care about average income — it cares about the **dispersion** of income. With high inequality, there are enough ultra-rich customers even if the average is low
- The luxury real estate bubble in Central London was driven by **inequality in Russia and the Arabian Gulf**, totally independent of British real estate dynamics
- Larry Summers' controversy: males and females have equal average intelligence, but males have more **variance** (more very stupid and more very brilliant). Number of successful scientists depends on the tails, not the average

> "Growth in society may not come from raising the average, but from increasing the number of people in the 'tails' — that small, very small number of risk takers crazy enough to have ideas of their own."

### The Thalesian and the Aristotelian

- The **Thalesian** (decision maker) focuses on the payoff — asymmetries and nonlinear effects. The **Aristotelian** focuses on being right and wrong — raw logic
- Aristotle made the mistake of thinking that knowledge about the event (future crop price) and making profits from it are the same thing. **Because of asymmetry, the two are not the same**
- As Fat Tony says: "They are not the same thing" (pronounced "ting")

### How to Be Stupid

- If you have optionality, you don't need much intelligence. You don't have to be right often — all you need is the wisdom to **not do unintelligent things** (acts of omission) and **recognize favorable outcomes when they occur**
- Your assessment doesn't need to be made beforehand, only after the outcome — this is the **"philosopher's stone"** or **"convexity bias"** (Jensen's inequality)
- Evolution produces astonishingly sophisticated objects without intelligence — through optionality plus a selection filter, plus randomness

### Nature and Options

- François Jacob introduced the notion of options in natural systems via **bricolage** — trial and error close to tweaking, making do with what you've got
- Nature selects even within the womb: about half of embryos undergo spontaneous abortion. Nature does a California-style **"fail early"** — it has an option and uses it
- **Optionality is a substitute for intelligence** — nature understands optionality effects vastly better than humans
- **Trial and error = tinkering** when it presents small errors and large gains. "Convexity" is the more precise description of this positive asymmetry
- Steve Jobs' "Stay hungry, stay foolish" probably meant: **be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it**

### The Rationality

- **Option = asymmetry + rationality**: the rationality part lies in keeping what is good and ditching the bad
- Nature has a filter to keep the good and get rid of the bad — biological systems **ratchet up**, getting locked into states better than the previous one
- Explicit options (traded on exchanges) tend to be **expensive and overhyped**. But embedded options in other domains — where we don't recognize them due to **domain dependence** — tend to be underpriced or free
- The Wharton School options lecture that determined Taleb's career: the professor didn't see the full implications of asymmetry himself
- **Option blindness**: we fail to recognize options that are hiding in plain sight — errors in models can be options too (happy errors bring gains, unhappy errors bring losses). Fat Tony exploited this by targeting models with only unhappy errors

### Life Is Long Gamma

- Rabbi Anthony Glickman: **"Life is long gamma"** — meaning life benefits from volatility and variability
- "Long gamma" in trader jargon = "benefits from the nonlinearity of options" = benefits from volatility
- Academic literature argues options are overpriced ("long shot bias") — but this confuses **casino risk** (well-tractable, bounded) with **real life risk** (Extremistan, unbounded upside)
- Risk taking *ain't* gambling, and optionality *ain't* lottery tickets
- The largest generators of wealth in America: **real estate** (investors have the option at the expense of banks) and **technology** (relies almost completely on trial and error)
- Banks have **negative optionality** — they lose periodically every penny made in their history thanks to blowups

### Roman Politics Likes Optionality

- Even political systems follow rational tinkering: **Polybius** compares the Greek legislator Lycurgus (designed by reasoning) to the Romans, who reached their system by "the discipline of many struggles and troubles, always choosing the best by the light of experience gained in disaster"

> "If you think that education causes wealth, or that intelligent actions and discoveries are the result of intelligent ideas, you will be in for a surprise."

## Chapter 13: Lecturing Birds on How to Fly

*The wheel — Proto–Fat Tony thinking — The central problem is that birds rarely write more than ornithologists — Combining stupidity with wisdom rather than the opposite*

### The Wheeled Suitcase

- It took close to **six thousand years** between the invention of the wheel and putting tiny wheels directly under the suitcase — this happened three decades after we put a man on the moon
- The technology is only trivial **retrospectively**, not prospectively. The most brilliant minds carrying suitcases through airports never thought to apply their brain to this transportation problem
- We humans **lack imagination** about the future to the point of not even knowing what tomorrow's important things look like — which is why antifragility is necessary
- The Mesoamericans had wheels — on small toys for children. The Mayans and Zapotecs never made the leap to applying wheels for transportation. The **steam engine** was similarly known to the Greeks (Hero of Alexandria's aeolipyle) but not implemented for centuries
- **Just as great geniuses invent their predecessors, practical innovations create their theoretical ancestry**

### Discovery vs. Implementation

- Randomness plays a role at two levels: the **invention** and the **implementation** — and we play down the role of chance in both
- Implementation does not necessarily proceed from invention — it too requires luck and circumstances. The history of medicine is littered with cures discovered then implemented much later
- **The Half-Invented**: there is a category of things we can call half-invented. Taking the half-invented into the invented is often the real breakthrough (Steve Jobs with the graphical interface/mouse → desktop → laptop)
- The simplest technologies but not even technologies but tools — like the wheel — are the ones that run the world. Complex "technologies" have very high mortality rates

### Once More, Less Is More

- The simpler and more obvious the discovery, the less equipped we are to figure it out by complicated methods — **the significant can only be revealed through practice**
- Governments and universities have done very little for innovation and discovery, precisely because they look for the complicated, the grandiose, the scientistic — rarely for the wheel on the suitcase. **Simplicity does not lead to laurels**

### Mind the Gaps

- **"Translational gap"**: the time difference between formal discovery and first implementation — shown by Contopoulos-Ioannidis to be lengthening in modern times
- Two centuries between discovery of germs and acceptance as cause of disease; thirty years between germ theory and antisepsis; sixty years between antisepsis and drug therapy
- In the dark ages of medicine, doctors relied on balance of humors, continuing bloodletting and cataplasms for centuries after Harvey demonstrated blood circulation in the 1620s
- Resisting **old** harmful technology is irrational; resisting **new** untested technology is rational risk management. But the resistance to implementing obvious improvements (removing harmful practices) is **cowardice**, not wisdom

### Search and How Errors Can Be Investments

- Trial and error is not truly random — it requires **rationality** in recognizing the favorable outcome and knowing what to discard
- Every trial, every failure provides additional information — if you know what doesn't work, you're closer to what does. **From the trial that fails to deliver, figure out progressively where to go**
- **Greg Stemm** (shipwreck treasure hunter): his "bad quarter" (searching, no finds) was not distress but investment. His method: systematic elimination of search areas, each failure incrementally raising the probability of the next search yielding a result
- Same method applies to **oil and gas exploration** — except the upside is nearly unlimited (vs. fixed treasure value)
- Optionality-driven search is not foolishly random — it becomes **tamed and harvested randomness**

### Creative and Uncreative Destructions

- **Joseph Schumpeter** got a minor version of the point: **creative destruction** — some things need to break for the system to improve
- But Schumpeter didn't think in terms of uncertainty and opacity; he was completely smoked by **interventionism**, thinking governments could innovate by fiat
- Both Schumpeter and his Harvard detractors missed the notion of antifragility as **asymmetry (optionality) effects** — the philosopher's stone that is the real agent of growth

### The Soviet-Harvard Department of Ornithology

- Two types of knowledge: (1) **apophatic** — tacit, cannot be expressed in direct language, a way of doing things we can't codify; (2) **academic** — explainable, formalizable, theoretizable, Harvardifiable, Sovietizable
- The error of naive rationalism: **overestimating the role of academic knowledge** and degrading the uncodifiable, intuitive, experience-based type
- Most texts define technology as "the application of scientific knowledge to practical projects" — this leads us to believe knowledge flows from lofty science down to lowly practice. **The reality is largely the reverse**
- The **Baconian linear model**: Academia → Applied Science and Technology → Practice. While valid in rare cases (the atomic bomb), the exact reverse is true in most domains examined
- **Lecturing birds on how to fly**: imagine hieratic professors lecturing birds on flight. The bird flies. They rush to claim the bird obeyed them. The Harvard Department of Ornithology is now "indispensable" for bird flying and gets government research funds
- Birds write no papers or books, so we never get their side of the story. The priests keep broadcasting theirs

### Epiphenomena

- The Soviet-Harvard illusion belongs to a class of causal illusions called **epiphenomena**: when you stand on a bridge with a large compass, you develop the impression the compass is directing the ship rather than merely reflecting its direction
- We see high academic research in wealthy, developed countries and uncritically conclude research generates the wealth — a classic epiphenomenal error
- **Greed as a cause**: whenever an economic crisis occurs, greed is blamed. But greed is much older than systemic fragility — it existed since Virgil's *auri sacra fames*. Greed is an epiphenomenon; the real cause is the **system's fragility**
- "Lack of vigilance" is similarly proposed as a cause — but that's like saying the cause of a mafia don's death is making enemies, and the cure is making friends

### Debunking Epiphenomena

- **Granger causality** (Clive Granger, Economics Nobel): the only rigorous scientific technique for establishing causation — look at the **sequence** of events (what comes first, A or B?) rather than just co-occurrence
- Life is lived forward but remembered backward (Kierkegaard) — books exacerbate this, creating illusions of causality from scrambled sequences
- **Cherry-picking has optionality**: the one telling the story can show only confirmatory examples and ignore the rest. The more volatility and dispersion, the rosier the best story (and darker the worst)

### The Alternative Process

- The real process is a **loop**: Random Tinkering (antifragile) → Heuristics (technology) → Practice and Apprenticeship → Random Tinkering → ...
- In parallel: Practice → Academic Theories → Academic Theories → Academic Theories ... (with rare accidental leaks, overhyped and grossly generalized)

## Chapter 14: When Two Things Are Not the "Same Thing"

*Green lumber another "blue" — Where we look for the arrow of discovery — Putting Iraq in the middle of Pakistan — Prometheus never looked back*

### The Abu Dhabi Model

- Abu Dhabi: oil-rich countries building huge universities, importing Sorbonne and NYU, under the postulation that oil reserves can be turned into knowledge — the belief that *university knowledge generates economic wealth*
- But this comes from superstition, not empiricism. Switzerland (Chapter 5) — a place with very low formal education — is among the wealthiest
- The spending on imported education is completely **sterile** — a great transfer of resources rather than milking antifragility by forcing citizens to make money naturally through circumstances

### Where Are the Stressors?

- *Necessitas magistra* (Erasmus): "Necessity is the mother of invention." Publilius Syrus: *hominem experiri multa paupertas iubet* — "poverty makes experiences"
- Taleb's village of Amioun, pillaged and evacuated during the war, became opulent twenty-five years later. "People from Amioun only do well when shaken." **That's antifragility**

### L'Art pour l'Art, to Learn for Learning's Sake

- **Lant Pritchet** (World Bank economist): no evidence that raising the general level of education raises income at the country level. The opposite is true — **wealth leads to the rise of education**, not the other way
- Ha-Joon Chang: in 1960 Taiwan had lower literacy than the Philippines and half the income; today Taiwan has ten times the income. Korea had lower literacy than Argentina; today it has three times as much
- Sub-Saharan Africa saw markedly increasing literacy rates accompanied with a **decrease** in standard of living
- The *fooled by randomness* effect: rich countries are educated → people infer education makes countries rich (mistaking association for causation)
- For individuals, education builds helpful credentials — but this effect washes out at the country level
- **Alison Wolf**: the simple one-way relationship "education spending in, economic growth out" simply doesn't exist. Egypt's giant leap in education did not translate into growth

> "Scholarship and organized education are not the same."

### Polished Dinner Partners

- In ancient times, learning was **for learning's sake** — making someone a good person worth talking to, not to increase gold in the city's coffers
- **The halo effect**: skills in conversation/culture are mistakenly assumed to translate into business/practical skills. The more cultured and interesting someone is, the more we're trapped into thinking they're effective
- **Skills at doing ≠ skills at talking**: good practitioners are often totally incomprehensible — they don't waste energy on elegant narratives. Entrepreneurs are doers, not thinkers. The quality lies in their product, not their conversation
- Bureaucrats, lacking objective success metrics and market forces, are selected on the "halo effects" of shallow looks and elegance

### The Green Lumber Fallacy

- From the book *What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars*: **Joe Siegel**, one of the most successful lumber traders, thought "green lumber" was lumber painted green (it's actually freshly cut, undried lumber). He made it his profession to trade it
- Meanwhile, the narrator was into grand intellectual theories about commodity prices — and went bust
- The successful expert was ignorant of central matters like the color designation "green" — but he knew things about lumber that nonexperts think are unimportant. **People we call ignorant might not be ignorant**
- Predicting price flow in lumber had little to do with the narrative details outsiders assume are important. **Evolution does not rely on narratives**
- The **green lumber fallacy**: the situation in which one mistakes a source of necessary knowledge — the "greenness" of lumber — for another, less visible from the outside, less tractable, less narratable

### Taleb's Discovery of the Green Lumber Fallacy

- When Taleb became a derivatives professional, foreign exchange traders were street-level New Jersey/Brooklyn Italian fellows — not economists or geopoliticians. They couldn't find Switzerland on a map, yet were the world's best Swiss franc traders
- London traders were even more sub-blue collar — East End cockney, using their own numbering system ("Lady Godiva" = five, "ching" = fifteen, "pony" = twenty-five)
- **Price and reality as seen by economists are not the same thing** — the relation may have optionality in places that non-sentence-savvy people knew deep inside

### How Fat Tony Got Rich (and Fat)

- Fat Tony made eighteen million dollars from three hundred thousand in the aftermath of the Kuwait war (January 1991)
- Every analyst predicted oil would rise with war. Tony bet against it — prices had already adjusted to expectations. **"It has to be 'in the price'"**
- Oil collapsed from $39 to almost half. Many people lost their shirts while *correctly predicting* war — they confused the event with its price effect. **"Kuwait and oil are not the same ting"**
- Fund managers with elaborate war-room analysis of Kuwait, Iraq, Washington knew everything except the simple fact that it had **nothing to do with oil** — *not the same "ting"*

> "Good speculative bets come to you, you don't get them by just staying focused on the news."

### Conflation

- There is *something* (perception, ideas, theories) and a *function of something* (price, reality). The **conflation** is to mistake one for the other, forgetting the function has different properties
- The more asymmetries between the *something* and the *function of something*, the more difference between the two — they may end up having nothing to do with each other
- **Jim Simons** (Renaissance Technologies) escaped the conflation: he never hires economists or finance people, only physicists and mathematicians doing pattern recognition — accessing the internal logic without theorizing. He never listens to economists or reads their reports
- **Ariel Rubinstein** (game theory leader) gets the green lumber fallacy: he refuses to claim his theoretical knowledge translates into anything directly practical. Economics is like a fable — to stimulate ideas, not to direct practice
- Rubinstein tried applying game theory bargaining to a Levantine souk vendor — the vendor told him "For generations, we have bargained in our way and you come and try to change it?" Theory should stay independent from practice
- **Specialization** (Ricardian comparative advantage) blows up when imposed top-down by policy makers, but works well when reached progressively through evolutionary means with buffers and layers of redundancy
- The important things that cannot be easily narrated lie mainly in **optionality** — the missed optionality of things. You don't go to school to learn optionality; you go to school to become blind to it

### Prometheus and Epimetheus

- **Prometheus** = "fore-thinker" — represents the progress of civilization. **Epimetheus** = "after-thinker" — falls for retrospective narrative distortion
- Optionality is **Promethean**: reversible, benign mistakes. Narratives are **Epimethean**: the gravity and irreversibility of Pandora's box
- Table 4 contrasts narrative knowledge vs. optionality-driven tinkering across many dimensions: tourist vs. flâneur, concave vs. convex, fragile vs. robust rationality, trapped in a story vs. no meaningful dependence on story
- **Heuristic knowledge** (rules of thumb) embedded in traditions: evolution operates on tacit, unexplainable rules transmitted through generations — what Karl Popper called **evolutionary epistemology**
- An idea survives not because it is better than the competition, but because **the person who holds it has survived**. Grandmother's wisdom should be empirically superior to business school knowledge
- **Expert problems**: when you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. When you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error

## Chapter 15: History Written by the Losers

*The birds may perhaps listen — Combining stupidity with wisdom rather than the opposite — Where we look for the arrow of discovery — A vindication of trial and error*

### The Lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly Effect Across Domains

- Table 5 shows the **misattribution of results** across fields:
  - **Jet Engine**: attributed to physicists, actually from tinkering engineers (busted by Scranton)
  - **Architecture**: attributed to Euclidean geometry, actually from heuristics and guild recipes (busted by Beaujouan)
  - **Cybernetics**: attributed to Norbert Wiener, actually from programmers "wiki-style" (busted by Mindell)
  - **Derivatives formulas**: attributed to Black-Scholes-Merton, actually from traders and practitioners like Regnauld, Bachelier, Thorp (busted by Haug and Taleb)
  - **Medicine**: attributed to biological understanding, actually from luck, trial and error, side effects
  - **Industrial Revolution**: attributed to Scientific Revolution, actually from adventurers and hobbyists (busted by Kealey)

### The Options Pricing Story

- Taleb and **Espen Haug** (trader turned researcher) investigated the origin of option pricing formulas: traders had vastly, vastly more sophistication than the formula, **at least a century** before the academics claimed to derive it
- Practitioners' sophistication was picked up through natural selection, survivorship, apprenticeship, and experience
- The real sequence: Traders trade → traders figure out techniques → academics find formulas and claim traders are using *them* → new traders believe academics → blowups (theory-induced fragility)
- The Barnard College editor tried to **rewrite their story** in the *Wiley Encyclopedia of Quantitative Finance* — scientific history being made in the making
- **"We don't put theories into practice. We create theories out of practice."** — *ex cura theoria nascitur*

### The Evidence Staring at Us

- **Phil Scranton** (Rutgers professor): jet engines were built by trial-and-error experiential methods, without anyone understanding the theory. Builders needed engineers who knew how to twist things to make the engine work. *Theory came later*
- **David Mindell**: cybernetics was not invented by Norbert Wiener — he was articulating ideas about feedback control that had long been in practice in engineering
- **Architecture**: before the thirteenth century, no more than five persons in Europe could perform a division. Yet builders figured out resistance of materials — buildings still standing. Villard de Honnecourt documented how cathedrals were built: **experimental heuristics, small tricks and rules**, not formal geometry
- Romans built aqueducts without mathematics (Roman numerals don't even allow quantitative analysis). A side effect of mathematics may be making people **over-optimize and cut corners**, causing fragility
- **Vitruvius** (*De architectura*): no mention of Euclid, mostly heuristics — master guiding apprentice knowledge

### Is It Like Cooking?

- **Cooking** is the perfect optionality business: add an ingredient, keep it if it works (agrees with Fat Tony's taste buds), discard if not. Recipes evolved through generations of collective tinkering — entirely without conjectures about food chemistry
- Pure **physics** is the exception where the "epistemic base" genuinely matters (Higgs Boson, Le Verrier predicting Neptune). But most domains resemble cooking a lot more than physics
- Medicine today remains an **apprenticeship model** with theoretical science in the background, made to look like science

### The Computer and the Internet

- Computers: combinatorics (basic science) → computers. But first they were cumbersome boxes good for database management. Then the keyboard/screen. Then word processing (1980s). Then Phase Two: the **Internet** — from DARPA military resilience project → personal computer → social networks, dating. **All unintended consequences**
- At no point did academic science serve in setting its direction — it served as a slave to chance discoveries by college dropouts and overgrown high school students

### China's Missing Mania

- Joseph Needham showed China, as it became a top-down mandarinate (Soviet-Harvard centralized scribes), lost the **"European mania for tinkering and improving."** They had all the means to develop a spinning machine but "nobody tried"

### The Industrial Revolution

- **Terence Kealey** (*The Economic Laws of Scientific Research*): questions the "linear model" that academic science leads to technology. Universities prospered as a *consequence* of national wealth, not the other way. Government-funded research has had **iatrogenic** effects — private investment decreases and moves away
- The steam engine emerged from preexisting technology, created by **uneducated, often isolated men** applying practical common sense and intuition
- Textile technologies (flying shuttle 1733, spinning jenny 1770): nothing to science — empirical developments by skilled craftsmen
- Two main sources of innovation in the 19th-20th centuries: **the hobbyist and the English rector** (both in barbell situations — secure income + free time + optionality)
- English parish priests with comfortable houses and scones: Rev. Cartwright (power loom), Rev. Jack Russell (bred the terrier), Rev. Buckland (first dinosaur authority), Rev. Greenwell (modern archaeology), Rev. Garrett (submarine), Rev. Gilbert White (naturalist)

> "Luxe, calme et volupté" — the solitary scholar in the tranquility of his spacious room, contrasted with the tumult of schools and collective workplaces

### Governments Should Spend on Nonteleological Tinkering, Not Research

- Government spending can work — the Internet came from DARPA. But functionaries are too **teleological** in how they spend. Big Pharma is its own enemy
- **Blue sky research**: grants given to people, not projects, spread in small amounts across many researchers. Venture capitalists back **entrepreneurs, not ideas** — "bet on the jockey, not the horse"
- The **1/N strategy**: if you face *n* options, invest in all in equal small amounts. In Extremistan with power-law payoffs, it's more important to be in something than to miss it. "The payoff can be so large that you can't afford not to be in everything"

### The Case in Medicine

- The National Cancer Institute's "war on cancer" (Nixon, early 1970s): Morton Meyers documents that over twenty years of screening 144,000 plant extracts (15,000 species), not a single plant-based anticancer drug reached approved status — **directed research failed**. Meanwhile, the Vinca Alkaloids (major cancer drugs) were discovered **by chance**
- Private industry develops nine drugs out of ten. Even of the 46 drugs with significant sales from NIH, only about three had anything to do with federal funding
- When an academic researcher makes a chance discovery, he tends to **disregard the consequences** because it's not what he was looking for — failing to exercise his option, a violation of rationality
- Chemotherapy came from mustard gas (WWII ship bombing off Bari, Italy, 1942) — discovered by observing effects on soldiers' blood cells. Churchill kept it secret; the Geneva Conventions banned it
- **James Le Fanu**: the "therapeutic revolution" (postwar period) was not ignited by scientific insight — it came from the realization that **synthetic chemistry blindly and randomly would deliver remedies** that had eluded doctors for centuries. The sulfonamides (Gerhard Domagk) are the central example
- The increase in theoretical understanding (the "epistemic base") came with a **decrease** in new drugs. In complex domains, "knowledge" can inhibit research
- **Drug obliquity**: aspirin changed its uses many times. Judah Folkman's angiogenesis inhibitors led to macular degeneration treatment (bevacizumab/Avastin) — more effective than the original intent
- Designer drugs have a problem: with tens of thousands of drugs on the market, the **interactions** between them are underestimated by a factor of four. The pool of available drugs should be shrinking, not growing

### Matt Ridley's Anti-Teleological Argument

- **Al-Ghazali** (medieval skeptic philosopher, aka Algazel): came up with the metaphor of the pin (now falsely attributed to Adam Smith). The pin doesn't have a single maker — twenty-five persons collaborate guided by an invisible hand, with no one knowing how to produce it alone
- **Matt Ridley**: the difference between humans and animals lies in the ability to collaborate and let ideas "copulate." Collaboration is **superadditive** (1+1 >> 2). Since you cannot forecast or direct collaborations, you can only create an environment that facilitates them
- Adam Smith meets Algazel: the invisible hand is the market; for the religious skeptic, it is God. **Fideism** (skepticism of human knowledge) is epistemologically equivalent to pure empirical skepticism
- All great skeptics have been religious or pro-religion — skepticism of expert knowledge, not of abstract entities

### Corporate Teleology

- **Strategic planning** has no evidence of working — and evidence against it. William Starbuck debunked its effectiveness; it makes corporations option-blind
- Almost everything theoretical in management (Taylorism, productivity stories) has been exposed as pseudoscience. Matthew Stewart (*The Management Myth*), Abrahamson and Friedman (*A Perfect Mess*)
- **Business drift**: Coca-Cola began as a pharmaceutical product. Tiffany & Co. started as a stationery store. Raytheon (missile guidance) was a refrigerator maker. Nokia was a paper mill. DuPont (Teflon, Kevlar) started as an explosives company. Avon started in door-to-door book sales

### The Inverse Turkey Problem

- **Evidence of absence is not absence of evidence**: for the antifragile, good news tends to be absent from past data. For the fragile, it's the bad news that doesn't show
- The **Carlos Slim** problem: if you go to Mexico and sample fifty million people, you may not include the one person (Slim) who is richer than the bottom seventy to ninety million combined. You massively **underestimate** total wealth
- For **antifragile** cases (positive asymmetries, trial and error, biotech): *the sample track record will tend to underestimate the long-term average; it will hide the qualities, not the defects*
- For **fragile** cases (negative asymmetries, turkey problems): *the sample track record will tend to overestimate the long-term average; it will hide the defects and display the qualities*
- **Gary Pisano** (Harvard): looked at biotech and concluded it had pitiful potential because "most firms earn no profit." Classic inverse-turkey mistake — in Extremistan, most firms *should* earn no profit; the rare event dominates
- **Kenneth Froot** (Harvard): opposite error — looked at reinsurance companies and thought they made too much profit, not realizing catastrophes seemed to occur *less often* than premia reflected. One single episode (asbestos) bankrupted families of Lloyd underwriters, losing income made over generations

### To Fail Seven Times, Plus or Minus Two

- Rules from the chapter: (i) Look for optionality and rank things accordingly; (ii) Preferably open-ended, not closed-ended payoffs; (iii) Invest in people, not business plans — look for someone capable of changing six or seven times (Marc Andreessen's modus operandi); (iv) Make sure you are barbelled

### The Charlatan, the Academic, and the Showman

- The **empirics** — medical practitioners who relied on experiment and experience — have been treated badly by history. They didn't write books. Formal thinkers wrote the history
- **"Charlatan"** was a synonym for *empirick*. "Empiric" designated someone who relied on trial and error and tinkering — held to be inferior professionally, socially, and intellectually
- The medical establishment regulated empirics out of economic competition (protecting their incomes). But "legitimate" doctors were silently copying remedies developed by the Others
- Formal academics were no better than charlatans in practice — they just hid their fraud under more convincing rationalizations. They were just **organized quacks**
- **"All that is nonrigorous is nonacademic"** does NOT imply **"all that is nonacademic is nonrigorous"** — a logical fallacy used to dismiss practitioners

---

## Chapter 16: A Lesson in Disorder

*Where is the next street fight? — How to decommoditize, detouristify — The intelligent student (also in reverse) — Flâneur as options*

### The Ecological and the Ludic

- Two domains: the **ludic** (game-like, rules supplied in advance) and the **ecological** (real life, rules unknown, variables not isolable)
- Skills acquired in a classroom are **non-ecological** — they stay largely in the classroom. Chess skills don't improve general reasoning; blind chess players can't remember things outside the board
- **Laura Martignon**: children's ability to count **degrades** right after being taught arithmetic. Children who don't know arithmetic correctly figure there are fourteen intervals between fifteen poles; those who studied arithmetic get confused and say fifteen

### The Touristification of the Soccer Mom

- **E. O. Wilson**: the biggest hindrance to child development is the soccer mom — eliminating trial and error, antifragility, and the ecological from children's lives, transforming them into nerds on preexisting maps of reality
- One can be an intellectual without being a nerd: have a private library instead of a classroom, spend time as a rational flâneur benefiting from randomness
- We need randomness, mess, uncertainty, self-discovery, near-traumatic episodes — **the right type of rigor** — compared to the structured, fake life of an empty-suit CEO
- Lions in captivity live longer and are technically richer — but they are not lions. **Only the autodidacts are free**

> "We do not study for life, but only for the lecture room." — Seneca (*non vitae, sed scolae discimus*)

### An Antifragile (Barbell) Education

- Taleb's father was known in Lebanon as the "Intelligent Student Student Intelligent" — *taleb nagib* is Arabic for "intelligent student." He was national valedictorian
- Observing his father: being an Intelligent Student meant mostly in the **negative** — things intelligent students were unable to understand. Some blindness came with the package
- **Good grades carry side effects** — they correspond to intellectual sacrifice. The person at the exact bottom of his father's class turned out to be the most successful (self-made merchant with a huge yacht)
- Taleb was a **barbell autodidact**: studied the exact minimum necessary to pass exams, read voraciously outside the curriculum — thirty to sixty hours per week of self-directed reading
- **The trick is to be bored with a specific book, not with reading itself.** Jump from one book to the next when bored. The number of pages absorbed grows faster. **Trial and error is freedom**
- At Wharton, Taleb specialized in probability and rare events: "I saw the limits of probability in front of me, clear as crystal, but could not find the words to express the point." He ordered every book with "probability" or "stochastic" in its title and read for years
- **"Much of what other people know isn't worth knowing."** The treasure, what one needs to know for a profession, lies outside the corpus, as far from the center as possible
- What I was given to study in school I have forgotten; what I decided to read on my own, I still remember

## Chapter 17: Fat Tony Debates Socrates

*Piety for the impious — Fat Tony does not drink milk — Always ask poets to explain their poetry — Mystagogue philosophaster*

### Euthyphro

- Fat Tony believes they were **totally justified in putting Socrates to death**
- This chapter completes the discussion of the difference between **narrated, intelligible knowledge** and the more opaque kind that is entirely probed by tinkering — the two columns of Table 4 separating narrative and non-narrative action
- There is this error of thinking that things always have a *reason* that is accessible to us — that we can comprehend easily
- The most severe mistake made in life is to **mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent** — something Nietzsche figured out. It resembles the turkey problem, mistaking what we don't see for the nonexistent
- **Plato** expressed himself chiefly through his use of Socrates, the Athenian who became the most influential philosopher in the modern sense. Socrates left no writing of his own — we get direct representation mainly through **Plato and Xenophon**
- In one of Plato's dialogues, *Euthyphro*, Socrates was outside the courthouse awaiting his trial when **Euthyphro**, a religious expert, struck up a conversation. Socrates started explaining the charges against him (corrupting the youth, introducing new gods)
- Euthyphro was on his way to charge his own father with manslaughter — Socrates started wondering how this was compatible with Euthyphro's religious duties
- **Socrates' technique**: make his interlocutor agree to a thesis, then proceed to show how the statements he agreed to are inconsistent with the original thesis — establishing that the person has no clue what he's talking about
- Euthyphro could not produce a definition of piety. The dialogue continued with more definitions until Euthyphro found a polite excuse to run away — the reader is left with the impression it could have gone on for twenty-five centuries without bringing us any closer to anything

### Fat Tony Versus Socrates

- Imagine Fat Tony asked by Socrates how he defined piety — Fat Tony's answer would have been most certainly to ***get lost***
- Fat Tony's power in life is that he **never lets the other person frame the question** — he taught Nero that an answer is planted in every question; never respond with a straight answer to a question that makes no sense to you

> FAT TONY: "You are asking me to define what characteristic makes a difference between pious and nonpious. Do I really *need* to be able to tell you what it is to be able to conduct a pious action?"
> SOCRATES: "How can you use a word like 'piety' without knowing what it means?"
> FAT TONY: "Do I actually have to tell you in plain barbarian non-Greek English what it means to prove that I know and understand what it means? I don't know it in words but I know what it is."

- Fat Tony would have taken Socrates down his own road, using the Socratic pattern of dialogue:

> FAT TONY: "Tell me, old man. Does a child need to define mother's milk to understand the need to drink it?"
> SOCRATES: "No, he does not need to."
> FAT TONY: "And my dear Socrates, does a dog need to define what an owner is to be loyal to him?"
> SOCRATES (puzzled): "A dog has instinct. It does not reflect on its life."
> FAT TONY: "But are we humans so fundamentally different as to be completely stripped of instinct leading us to do things we have no clue about? Do we have to limit life to what we can answer in proto-Brooklyn English?"

- Without waiting for Socrates' answer (only suckers wait for answers; questions are not made for answers):

> FAT TONY: "Then, my good Socrates, why do you think that we need to fix the meaning of things?"
> SOCRATES: "My dear Mega-Tony, we need to know what we are talking about when we talk about things... An unexamined life is not worth living."
> FAT TONY: "The problem, my poor old Greek, is that you are killing the things we can know but not express. And if I asked someone riding a bicycle just fine to give me the theory behind his bicycle riding, he would fall from it. By bullying and questioning people you confuse them and hurt them."

- Then, looking at him patronizingly, with a smirk, very calmly:

> FAT TONY: "My dear Socrates... you know why they are putting you to death? It is because you make people feel stupid for blindly following habits, instincts, and traditions. You may be occasionally right. But you may confuse them about things they've been doing just fine without getting in trouble. You are destroying people's illusions about themselves. You are taking the joy of ignorance out of the things we don't understand. And you have *no* answer; you have *no* answer to offer them."

### Primacy of Definitional Knowledge

- What Fat Tony is hitting here is the very core of philosophy: the main questions that became philosophy were first raised by Socrates — "what is existence?," "what are morals?," "what is a proof?," "what is science?"
- The question in *Euthyphro* pervades the various dialogues written by Plato — Socrates is seeking relentlessly **definitions of the essential nature** of the thing concerned rather than descriptions of the properties by means of which we can recognize them
- Socrates cross-examined the poets and reported they had no more clue than the public about their own works — in Plato's *Apology* he recounted taking them elaborate passages and asking what was the meaning
- This priority of definitional knowledge led to Plato's thesis: you cannot know anything unless you know the **Forms** — if we cannot define piety from working with particulars, start with the universals. If you cannot get a map from a territory, build a territory out of the map
- In defense of Socrates: if his questions could not define what something *was*, they at least allowed him to be certain about **what a thing was not**

### Mistaking the Unintelligible for the Unintelligent

- Fat Tony had many precursors who attacked the primacy of philosophy and rationalistic knowledge — many forgotten because structured learning likes the **impoverishment and simplification of naive rationalism**, easy to teach
- A vivid modern attack came from the young **Friedrich Nietzsche** — his first book, *The Birth of Tragedy*, written in his early twenties, went after Socrates, whom he called "mystagogue of science," for "making existence appear comprehensible"
- This brilliant passage exposes what Taleb calls the **sucker-rationalistic fallacy**: "Perhaps — thus he [Socrates] should have asked himself — what is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent? Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled?"

> "What is not intelligible to me is not necessarily unintelligent" — perhaps the most potent sentence in all of Nietzsche's century

- **Nietzsche** is allergic to Socrates' version of truth: according to Socrates, one does not knowingly do evil — knowledge is the panacea; error is evil; hence science is an optimistic enterprise. It is the very **goodness** of knowledge that Nietzsche questioned
- In *The Birth of Tragedy*, Nietzsche sees two forces: the **Apollonian** (measured, balanced, rational, imbued with reason and self-restraint) and the **Dionysian** (dark, visceral, wild, untamed, hard to understand). Ancient Greek culture balanced the two, until Socrates' influence gave a larger share to the Apollonian — yang without yin
- **Nietzsche figured out antifragility**: while many attribute "creative destruction" to Schumpeter, the more erudite source is Karl Marx, but it is indeed Nietzsche who first coined the term with reference to Dionysus — "creatively destructive" and "destructively creative"
- Reading *The Birth of Tragedy* twice — as a child and after a life thinking of randomness — Taleb realized Nietzsche understood that growth in knowledge **cannot proceed without the Dionysian**. Stochastic tinkering can be the source, and the Apollonian can be part of the selection process

### Tradition

- As Fat Tony said, Socrates was put to death because he disrupted something that was working just fine. Things are too complicated to be expressed in words; by doing so, you kill humans — or people may be **focusing on the right things but we are not good enough to figure it out intellectually**
- Death and martyrdom make good marketing — Socrates' classical critics believed he was **destroying the foundations of society** — the heuristics transmitted by the elders
- **Cato the Elder** was highly allergic to Socrates. He had the bottom-line mind of Fat Tony, with a much higher civic sense, respect for tradition, and commitment to moral rectitude. Plutarch quotes him: "Socrates was a mighty babbler who tried to make himself tyrant of his country in order to destroy its customs and entice its citizens into holding views contrary to law and order"
- Many defended this different type of knowledge: **Edmund Burke** countered the French Revolution for disrupting the "collected reasons of the ages," advocating small trial-and-error experiments in social systems. **Michael Oakeshott** believed traditions provide filtered collective knowledge. **Joseph de Maistre** was a counter-Enlightenment thinker who believed in the fundamental depravity of men unless checked by some dictatorship
- **Wittgenstein** would be at the top of modern antifragile thinkers — his remarkable insight into the inexpressible with words, the green lumber issue. He sacrificed everything for philosophy
- **Friedrich Hayek** opposed social planning on the grounds that the pricing system reveals knowledge embedded in society, not accessible to a social planner. But Hayek missed the notion of **optionality** as a substitute for the social planner — he believed in distributed intelligence, not optionality as a replacement for intelligence
- **Claude Lévi-Strauss** showed that nonliterate peoples had their own "science of the concrete," a holistic way of thinking in terms of objects and their sensuous qualities — rich as and even richer than ours. Green lumber
- **John Gray** fights the prevailing idea that the Enlightenment is a panacea, showing how what we call scientific progress can be a mirage

### The Sucker-Nonsucker Distinction

- For Fat Tony, the distinction in life isn't True or False, but **sucker or nonsucker**. In real life, as we saw with Seneca and Thales, **exposure is more important than knowledge**; decision effects supersede logic
- Textbook "knowledge" misses a dimension: the hidden **asymmetry of benefits** — the need to focus on the payoff from your actions instead of studying the structure of the world

> *Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. People in life talk about payoff, exposure, and consequences (risks and rewards), hence fragility and antifragility.*

- True and False ("belief") play a poor, secondary role in human decisions; it is the payoff from the True and the False that dominates — and it is almost always **asymmetric**, with one consequence much bigger than the other

### Fragility, Not Probability

- We check people for weapons before they board the plane — not because we believe they are terrorists (False), but because we are **fragile to terrorism**. There is an asymmetry: the payoff of the True (that they are terrorists) is too large
- *You decide principally based on fragility, not probability. You decide principally based on fragility, not so much on True/False.*
- If you jotted down all the decisions you've taken over your lifetime, you would realize almost all had **asymmetric payoff** — one side carrying a larger consequence. True/False (probability) does not work in the real world; it is the payoff that matters
- A 95 percent confidence level tells you the result being wrong is only 5% likely — but this ignores the **size of the effects**. If you told someone a plane was safe with 95 percent confidence level, that 1 percent crash probability would be alarming
- You have taken probably a billion decisions in your life. How many times have you computed probabilities? In casinos, but not elsewhere

### Conflation of Events and Exposure

- This brings us again to the **green lumber fallacy**: a Black Swan event and how it affects you — its impact on your finances, emotions, the destruction it will cause — are ***not the same "ting"***
- The predictors' reply when we point out their failures has typically been "we need better computation" to predict the event better — instead of the vastly more effective **"modify your exposure"** and learn to get out of trouble
- Something religions and traditional heuristics have been better at enforcing than naive and cosmetic science

### Conclusion to Book IV

- This section has attempted to vindicate the unreasonable mavericks, engineers, freelance entrepreneurs, innovative artists, and anti-academic thinkers — some had great courage, not just the courage to put forth their ideas, but the courage to accept to live in a world they knew they did not understand. And they enjoyed it
- Doing is wiser than you are prone to believe — and more rational. What was done here is to debunk the **Lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly epiphenomenon** and the "linear model," using the simple mathematical properties of optionality, which does not require knowledge or intelligence, merely **rationality in choice**
- No empirical evidence supports the statement that organized research leads to the great things promised by universities — the promoters of the Soviet-Harvard idea **do not use optionality** or second-order effects, which invalidates their views about the role of teleological science

### What Will Happen Next?

- When Taleb last met **Alison Wolf**, they discussed the dire problem with education — Ivy League universities becoming a status luxury good, like a Vuitton bag or a Cartier watch
- It is a huge drag on middle-class parents who have been plowing an increased share of their savings into these institutions — transferring their money to administrators, real estate developers, professors, and agents
- In the United States, there is a buildup of **student loans** that parallels the subprime-type buildup — both central to the formation of a bubble

## Book V: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear

- Book V presents a more technical rephrasing of the definition of antifragility from Seneca's asymmetry
- The nontechnical reader can skip Book V without any loss — the definition of antifragility from Seneca's asymmetry is amply sufficient for a literary read of the rest of the book

## Chapter 18: On the Difference Between a Large Stone and a Thousand Pebbles

*How to punish with a stone — I landed early (once) — Why attics are always useful — On the great benefits of avoiding Heathrow unless you have a guitar*

### Taleb's Return to Nonlinearity

- The **Procrustean bed** in life consists precisely in simplifying the nonlinear and making it linear — the simplification that distorts
- Taleb's interest in the nonlinearity of exposures went away as he began dealing with other matters related to uncertainty — the nature of randomness rather than how things react to random events
- After the crisis of the late 2000s, Taleb went through an episode of hell owing to contact with the press — suddenly deintellectualized, corrupted, extracted from his habitat, propelled into being a public commodity
- He found it hard for members of the media and public to accept that the job of a scholar is to **ignore insignificant current affairs**, to write books, not emails, and not to give lectures dancing on a stage
- Taleb then opted out of public life — when he managed to retake control of his schedule and brain, Lady Fortuna brought two ideas to him that had been inside him all along
- The tools of analysis of **nonlinear effects** are quite universal — he realized that everything nonlinear around him could be subjected to the same techniques of detection

### A Simple Rule to Detect the Fragile

- A story from the **rabbinical literature** (*Midrash Tehillim*), probably from earlier Near Eastern lore: A king, angry at his son, swore to crush him with a large stone. After calming down, he realized he was in trouble — a king who breaks his oath is unfit to rule. His sage advisor came up with a solution: have the stone cut into very small pebbles and pelt the son with them
- The difference between **a thousand pebbles and a large stone of equivalent weight** is a potent illustration of how fragility stems from nonlinear effects
- **Nonlinear** means the response is not straightforward and not a straight line — if you double the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect
- Throwing a ten-pound stone at someone's head will cause more than twice the harm of a five-pound stone, more than five times the harm of a one-pound stone — if you draw a line on a graph with harm on the vertical axis and size of stone on the horizontal, **it will be curved, not a straight line**
- This is a refinement of asymmetry

> *For the fragile, shocks bring higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a certain level).*

- **Examples of nonlinear harm:**
  - Driving a car into a wall at 50 mph causes more damage than driving into the same wall ten times at 5 mph — the harm at 50 mph is more than ten times the harm at 5 mph
  - Drinking seven bottles of wine (Bordeaux) in one sitting is more harmful than drinking one bottle a day for seven days — every additional glass harms you more than the preceding one, hence the system is **fragile to alcoholic consumption**
  - Letting a porcelain cup drop from one foot (about 30 cm) is worse than twelve times the damage from a drop of one inch (2.5 cm)
  - Jumping from thirty feet (ten meters) brings more than ten times the harm of jumping from three feet (one meter) — thirty feet seems to be the cutoff point for death from free fall
- This is a simple expansion of the **foundational asymmetry** from Seneca's thinking — asymmetry is necessarily nonlinearity: more harm than benefits means an increase in intensity brings more harm than a corresponding decrease offers benefits

### Why Is Fragility Nonlinear?

- The central argument: fragility is generally in the **nonlinear** and not in the linear — the intuition from the porcelain cup
- The answer has to do with the structure of **survival probabilities**: conditional on something being unharmed (or having survived), it is more harmed by a single large rock than a thousand pebbles — by a single large infrequent event than by the cumulative effect of smaller shocks
- If jumping one millimeter caused an exact linear fraction of the damage of jumping thirty feet, we would already be dead from cumulative harm — we would have expired within hours from touching objects or pacing in our living rooms
- The fragility that comes from linearity is immediately visible (the object would already be broken), so we rule it out
- **What is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects** — and extreme, rare events, since large impacts of large size (or high speed) are rarer than ones of small size (and slow speed)
- In connection with **Black Swans** and extreme events: there are a lot more ordinary events than extreme events — in financial markets, at least ten thousand times more events of 0.1% magnitude than events of 10% magnitude
- Close to eight thousand **microearthquakes** daily on planet Earth (below 2 on the Richter scale) — about three million a year, totally harmless; but shocks of intensity 6 and higher make the newspapers
- Objects like porcelain cups get a million more hits of one hundredth of a pound per square inch than hits of a hundred pounds per square inch — we are necessarily immune to the **cumulative** effect of small deviations, which affect us disproportionally less (nonlinearly less) than larger ones

> *For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock.*

- The fragile is what is hurt a lot more by **extreme events** than by a succession of intermediate ones — and there is *no other* way to be fragile

### The Antifragile Case

- Flipping the argument: antifragility, too, is grounded in nonlinearities, nonlinear responses

> *For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).*

- A simple case — known heuristically by **weight lifters**: lifting one hundred pounds once brings more benefits than lifting fifty pounds twice, and certainly a lot more than lifting one pound a hundred times
- Benefits in weight-lifter terms: strengthening the body, muscle mass, and bar-fight looks rather than resistance and ability to run a marathon
- The second fifty pounds play a larger role, hence the nonlinear (i.e., **convexity**) effect — every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what weight lifters call "failure"
- The reach of this simple curve affects just about anything in sight — medical error, government size, innovation — anything that touches uncertainty — and it helps put the "plumbing" behind the statements on size and concentration

### When to Smile and When to Frown

- **Nonlinearity** comes in two kinds: **concave** (curves inward), as in the case of the king and the stone, or its opposite, **convex** (curves outward) — and of course, mixed, with concave and convex sections
- The convex resembles a **smile** and the concave resembles a **frown**
- Taleb uses the term **"convexity effect"** for both, saying "positive convexity effects" and "negative convexity effects"
- Why does asymmetry map to convexity or concavity? If for a given variation you have **more upside than downside** and you draw the curve, it will be convex; the opposite for the concave
- The convex graph turns into concave when one simply puts a **minus sign** in front of it — e.g., Fat Tony had the exact opposite payoff than a bank in a certain transaction: he made a buck whenever they lost one, and vice versa — profits and losses are mirror images
- The convex **likes volatility** — if you earn more than you lose from fluctuations, you want a lot of fluctuations

### Why Is the Concave Hurt by Black Swan Events?

- The more **concave** an exposure, the more harm from the unexpected, and disproportionately so — very large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect
- Figure 13 illustrates two exposures: one linear, one nonlinear with **negative convexity** (concavity) in the first graph, **positive convexity** in the second
- An unexpected event affects the nonlinear disproportionately more — the larger the event, the larger the difference

### Traffic in New York

- **Traffic is highly nonlinear** — when Taleb takes the day flight from New York to London and leaves at 5 a.m., it takes 26 minutes to reach JFK; leaving at 6 a.m. for the later flight, there is almost no difference in travel time
- One can add more and more cars on the highway with no or minimal impact on time spent in traffic — then, a mystery: increase the number of cars by 10% and watch the travel time jump by 50%
- The **convexity effect at work**: the average number of cars on the road does not matter much; what matters is the *volatility* of the number of cars — every additional car increases travel time more than the previous one
- Travel cost is **fragile to the volatility** of the number of cars on the highway
- This is a hint to a central problem: the **misunderstanding of nonlinear response** by those involved in creating "efficiencies" and "optimization" of systems
- European airports and railroads are stretched, seeming overly efficient — operating at close to maximal capacity with minimal redundancies — but a small increase in congestion (say 5% more planes) can give rise to chaos in airports, with travelers camping on floors
- **Central banks** can print money with no effect (and claim "safety"), then "unexpectedly" the printing causes a jump in inflation — many economic results are completely canceled by convexity effects
- The tools and culture of policy makers are based on the overly linear, ignoring these hidden effects — they call it "approximation"; when you hear of a **"second-order" effect**, it means convexity is causing the failure of approximation

### Someone Call New York City Officials

- An illustration of how convexity effects affect an **overoptimized system**, along with misforecasting large deviations
- New York City officials underestimated the effect of a line closure on traffic congestion — a small modification with compounded results in a system that is extremely stretched, hence fragile
- Taleb drove to NYC one Saturday evening in November 2011 to meet philosopher **Paul Boghossian** for dinner — typically a forty-minute trip
- He had been advocating the injection of **redundancy** into people's lives and boasted of never being late to anything since his New Year's resolution of 2007 — such discipline forces building buffers
- The greatest benefit of never-being-late discipline: it prevents cramming his day with appointments (which are typically neither useful nor pleasant)
- Around six o'clock, hitting Midtown, traffic stopped completely — by eight, he had moved hardly a few blocks — even his "redundancy buffer" failed
- What happened: NYC had authorized a film company to use the **Fifty-ninth Street Bridge**, blocking part of it, assuming it would be no problem on a Saturday — the small traffic problem turned into mayhem owing to the **multiplicative effects** — what they felt would be at worst a few minutes' delays was multiplied by two orders of magnitude; minutes became hours
- NYC authorities simply **did not understand nonlinearities**
- This is the central problem of efficiency: these types of errors compound, multiply, swell, with an effect that only goes in one direction — the wrong direction

### Where More Is Different

- Another intuitive way to look at convexity effects: consider the **scaling property** — if you double the exposure, do you more than double the harm? If so, it is a situation of fragility; otherwise, you are robust
- P. W. Anderson's paper **"More Is Different"** — what scientists in complexity call "emerging properties" is the nonlinear result of adding units, as the sum becomes increasingly different from the parts
- A city is not a large village; a corporation is not a larger small business — a state is not a large village — all these show nonlinearity in action

### A "Balanced Meal"

- An example of missing the hidden dimension of **variability**: we are told by the "Soviet-Harvard" U.S. health authorities to eat set quantities of nutrients every day in recommended amounts — every food item has a "percentage daily allowance"
- Aside from the total lack of empirical rigor in how these recommendations are derived, there is an insistence on **regularity** — getting calories and nutrients "steadily" throughout the day with "balanced" composition and metronomic regularity does **not** necessarily have the same effect as consuming them unevenly or randomly
- This is a denial of **hormesis** — the slight stressor of episodic deprivation
- For a long time, nobody even bothered to figure out whether **variability in distribution** — the second-order effect — mattered as much as long-term composition
- Research now shows that the effect of variability in food sources and the **nonlinearity in the physiological response** is central to biological systems — consuming no protein at all on Monday and catching up on Wednesday seemingly causes a different — better — physiological response, possibly because the deprivation activates pathways that facilitate subsequent absorption
- Until a few recent (and disconnected) empirical studies, this **convexity effect** had been totally missed by science — though not by religions, ancestral heuristics, and traditions
- Even if scientists get some convexity effects in dose response, the notion of convexity effects itself appears completely **missing from their language and methods**

### Run, Don't Walk

- An illustration that benefits from variation — **positive convexity effects**: Take two brothers, Castor and Polydeuces, who need to travel a mile
- Castor walks the mile at a leisurely pace and arrives in twenty minutes; Polydeuces spends fourteen minutes playing with his handheld device then runs the same mile in six minutes, arriving at the same time
- Both have covered the same distance in the same time — same average — but Castor (who walked) will presumably **not get the same health benefits** and gains in strength as Polydeuces (who sprinted)
- **Health benefits are convex to speed** (up to a point, of course)
- The very idea of exercise is to gain from antifragility to workout stressors — all kinds of exercise are just **exploitations of convexity effects**

### Small May Be Ugly, It Is Certainly Less Fragile

- We often hear "small is beautiful" — let us present it within the approach of **fragility equals concavity equals dislike of randomness**

### How to Be Squeezed

- A **squeeze** occurs when people have no choice but to do something, and do it right away, regardless of the costs
- Example: You need to fly to Marburg to defend a doctoral thesis, meet the parents, and get formally engaged — you buy an economy ticket to Frankfurt for $400 through London, but upon arriving at JFK, flights to London are canceled due to weather — you can get a last-minute flight to Frankfurt for **$4,000**, close to ten times the price — that's a squeeze
- **Squeezes are exacerbated by size** — when one is large, one becomes vulnerable to some errors, particularly horrendous squeezes — the squeezes become **nonlinearly costlier** as size increases
- Why you should **not own an elephant** as a pet: if there is a water shortage (a squeeze), you would have to pay a higher and higher price for each additional gallon of water — that's fragility, a **negative convexity effect** coming from getting too big
- The unexpected cost, as a percentage of the total, would be monstrous — owning a cat or dog would not bring about such high unexpected additional costs at times of squeeze

### Kerviel and Micro-Kerviel

- In spite of what is studied in business schools concerning **"economies of scale,"** size hurts you at times of stress — it is not a good idea to be large during difficult times
- Some economists have been wondering why mergers of corporations do not appear to play out — the combined unit is now much larger, hence more powerful, and according to the theories of economies of scale, it should be more "efficient" — but the numbers show, at best, **no gain from such increase in size** (already true in 1978)
- Richard Roll voiced the **"hubris hypothesis,"** finding it irrational for companies to engage in mergers given their poor historical record — recent data, more than three decades later, still confirm the poor record of mergers and the same hubris
- There appears to be something about **size that is harmful to corporations**
- As with elephants as pets, squeezes are **much more expensive (relative to size)** for large corporations — gains from size are visible but the risks are hidden, and some concealed risks seem to bring frailties into the companies
- **Large animals** (elephants, boa constrictors, mammoths) and other animals of size tend to become rapidly extinct — aside from the squeeze when resources are tight, there are mechanical considerations — large animals are more fragile to shocks than small ones — again, stone and pebbles
- **Jared Diamond**, always ahead of others, figured out such vulnerability in a paper called "Why Cats Have Nine Lives" — if you throw a cat or a mouse from an elevation of several times their height, they will typically manage to survive; elephants, by comparison, break limbs very easily

### The Société Générale Fire Sale

- **Société Générale** had to sell seventy billion dollars' worth of stocks in a single "fire sale" — markets were not very active ("thin") as it was Martin Luther King Day in the United States
- Markets worldwide dropped precipitously, close to 10 percent, costing the company close to **six billion dollars** in losses just from their fire sale
- They couldn't wait — over the weekend they had uncovered a fraud by **Jerome Kerviel**, a rogue back office employee playing with humongous sums in the market and hiding exposures from the main computer system
- They had no choice but to sell immediately — stocks they didn't even know they owned

### Fragility from Size (Figure 15)

- **Transaction costs as a function of size increase nonlinearly** — this demonstrates megafragility
- A fire sale of $70 billion worth of stocks leads to a loss of $6 billion, but a fire sale a tenth of that size ($7 billion) would result in **no loss at all**, as markets would absorb it without panic
- If instead of one very large bank with Kerviel as rogue trader, there were **ten smaller banks** each with a proportional "Micro-Kerviel" conducting rogue trading independently at random times, total losses for the ten banks would be **close to nothing**

### Taleb's Presentation to Société Générale

- A few weeks before the Kerviel episode, a French business school hired Taleb to present to the board of executives of the Société Générale meeting in Prague about Black Swan risks
- In the eyes of the bankers, he was like a **Jesuit preacher visiting Mecca** in the middle of the annual Hajj — their "quants" and risk people hated him with passion
- His talk was about pseudo risk techniques **à la Triffat** — methods commonly used to measure and predict events that have never worked before, and how they needed to focus on **fragility and barbells**
- He was heckled relentlessly by Kerviel's boss and the head of risk management; after his talk everyone ignored him as if he were a Martian
- The only person who was nice was the chairman, who mistook him for someone else and had no clue about what he was discussing
- Shortly after returning to New York, the Kerviel scandal broke — it was tantalizing that he had to keep his mouth shut for legal reasons

### The Real Problem Is Size

- The postmortem analyses were mistaken — attributing the problem to *bad* controls, the *bad* capitalistic system, and lack of vigilance
- It was not "greed" as commonly assumed — the problem is primarily **size**, and the **fragility that comes from size**
- Always keep in mind the difference between a **stone and its weight in pebbles** — the Kerviel story is illustrative and generalizable across domains

### Project Size and Fragility

- In project management, **Bent Flyvbjerg** has shown firm evidence that an increase in the size of projects maps to poor outcomes and higher costs of delays as a proportion of the total budget
- A nuance: it is the **size per segment** of the project that matters, not the entire project — some projects can be divided into pieces, not others
- Bridge and tunnel projects involve **monolithic planning** — cannot be broken into small portions; their percentage cost overruns increase markedly with size (same with dams)
- For roads, built by small segments, there is **no serious size effect** — project managers incur only small errors and can adapt; small segments go one small error at a time, with no serious role for squeezes

### Large Corporations Endangering Neighborhoods

- Large corporations end up **endangering neighborhoods** — Taleb argues against large superstore chains in spite of advertised benefits
- A large super-megastore wanted to acquire an entire neighborhood near where he lives — the argument in favor was "revitalization"
- His counter-argument: should the company go bust (which statistically it eventually will), the neighborhood becomes **a massive war zone**
- This is the argument British advisors **Rohan Silva** and **Steve Hilton** have used in favor of small merchants, along with the poetic "small is beautiful"
- It is completely wrong to use the **calculus of benefits without including the probability of failure**

### How to Exit a Movie Theater

- Another example of fragility from size: imagine how people exit a movie theater when someone shouts "fire" — a dozen persons squashed to death
- The **fragility of the theater is linked to size** — every additional person exiting brings more and more trauma (a **negative convexity effect**)
- A thousand people exiting in one minute is not the same as the same number exiting in half an hour
- Someone unfamiliar with the business who naively *optimizes* the size of the place (like Heathrow airport) might miss that **smooth functioning at regular times is different from rough functioning at times of stress**
- Contemporary economic optimized life causes us to build larger and larger theaters but with the exact same door — we no longer make this mistake with cinemas and stadiums, but we do in other domains like natural resources and food supplies
- The price of wheat **more than tripled** in 2004–2007 in response to a small increase in net demand, around 1 percent

> Bottlenecks are the mothers of all squeezes.

### Projects and Prediction

### Why Planes Don't Arrive Early

- Travelers do not like uncertainty — especially when on a set schedule — there is a **one-way effect**
- Taleb has taken the London–New York flight most of his life (about seven hours) — he recalls a few instances of arriving early (about twenty minutes, no more), but there have been instances of arriving **two or three hours late**, and at least one instance of it taking **more than two days** to reach his destination
- Because travel time cannot be really negative, **uncertainty tends to cause delays** — making arrival time increase, almost never decrease
- Arrival time may decrease by just minutes, but increase by hours — an **obvious asymmetry**
- Anything unexpected — any shock, any volatility — is much more likely to **extend** the total flying time
- This also explains the **irreversibility of time** — the passage of time as an increase in disorder

### Applying to Projects

- Just as when you add uncertainty to a flight, planes tend to land **later, not earlier** — when you add uncertainty to projects, they tend to **cost more and take longer** to complete
- These laws of physics are so universal they even work in Russia
- The interpretation in the past was that a **psychological bias** — the underestimation of the random structure of the world — was the cause (projects take longer because estimates are too optimistic)
- This is called **overconfidence** — decision scientists and business psychologists theorized the **"planning fallacy"** to explain why projects take longer, rarely less time, using psychological factors

### Historical Projects and the Planning Fallacy

- The puzzle: such underestimation did not seem to exist in the past century or so, though humans had the same biases
- Many large-scale projects a century and a half ago were completed **on time** — many tall buildings and monuments we see today are not just more elegant than modernistic structures but were completed **within, and often ahead of, schedule**
- Examples: the **Empire State Building** (still standing in New York), the **London Crystal Palace** (erected for the Great Exhibition of 1851, based on inventive ideas of a gardener, went from concept to grand opening in just **nine months** — 1,848 feet long by 454 feet wide, constructed from cast iron frames and glass)
- The Crystal Palace project **did not use computers**, parts were built close to the source, with a small number of businesses in the supply chain; there were no business schools teaching "project management" and no consulting firms — the **agency problem** was not significant
- It was a much more **linear economy** — less complex — than today's; we have more **nonlinearities, asymmetries, convexities** in today's world

### Why Black Swan Effects Are Increasing

- **Black Swan effects are necessarily increasing** as a result of complexity, interdependence between parts, globalization, and the beastly thing called **"efficiency"** that makes people sail too close to the wind
- Add consultants and business schools — one problem somewhere can **halt the entire project** — projects tend to get as weak as the **weakest link** in their chain (an acute **negative convexity effect**)
- The world is getting **less and less predictable**, and we rely more on technologies that have errors and interactions that are harder to estimate
- The **information economy** is the culprit — Bent Flyvbjerg showed the problem of cost overruns and delays is much more acute in the presence of **information technologies (IT)**, as computer projects cause a large share of these cost overruns
- The logic is simple: **negative convexity effects** are the main culprit, a direct and visible cause — there is an asymmetry in the way errors hit you, the same as with travel

### The Planning Fallacy Is Not Psychological

- No psychologist who has discussed the "planning fallacy" has realized that at the core, it is **not essentially a psychological problem** — not an issue with human errors; it is **inherent to the nonlinear structure** of the projects
- Just as time cannot be negative, a three-month project cannot be completed in zero or negative time
- On a timeline going left to right, **errors add to the right end, not the left end** — if uncertainty were linear we would observe some projects completed extremely early (just as we would arrive sometimes very early, sometimes very late) — but this is not the case

### Wars, Deficits, and Deficits

- The **Great War** was estimated to last only a few months; by the time it was over, it had gotten France and Britain heavily in debt — they incurred at least **ten times** what they thought their financial costs would be
- In the United States, the **Iraq war** was expected to cost thirty to sixty billion dollars; taking into account all indirect costs, it may have swelled to **more than two trillion** — indirect costs multiply, causing chains of interactions all going in the same direction of more costs
- **Complexity plus asymmetry** (plus types like George W. Bush) once again lead to **explosive errors**
- The larger the military, the **disproportionally larger** the cost overruns
- Wars — with more than **twentyfold errors** — are only illustrative of the way governments underestimate explosive nonlinearities (convexity effects) and why they should not be trusted with finances or any large-scale decisions
- Governments do not need wars to get us in trouble with deficits: the **underestimation of costs** of their projects is chronic for the very same reason 98 percent of contemporary projects have overruns
- Taleb's governmental golden rule: **no borrowing allowed, forced fiscal balance**

### Where the "Efficient" Is Not Efficient

- The costs of fragility are swelling visibly — **global disaster costs are today more than three times** what they were in the 1980s, adjusting for inflation
- The effect, noted by visionary researcher **Daniel Zajdenweber**, seems to be accelerating — the economy can get more and more "efficient," but fragility is causing the **costs of errors to be higher**
- Stock exchanges have converted from **"open outcry"** (wild traders face each other, yelling and screaming in a souk, then go drink together) to being **replaced by computers** — for very small visible benefits and massively large risks
- While errors made by traders are confined and distributed, those made by computerized systems go wild — in **August 2010**, a computer error made the entire market crash (the **"flash crash"**); in **August 2012**, the Knight Capital Group had its computer system go wild and cause **$10 million of losses a minute**, losing $480 million
- **Naive cost-benefit analyses** can be harmful — an effect that swells with size; for instance, the French focused on nuclear energy as it seemed "clean" and cheap and "optimal" on a computer screen, then after the **Fukushima disaster of 2011** had to scramble to add safety features at any cost — a squeeze similar to those mentioned earlier
- Additional expense was not part of the cost-benefit analysis that went into the initial decision — when comparing fuels or similar comparisons, **model error may hit one side more than the other**

### Pollution and Harm to the Planet

- Fossil fuels are harmful in a **nonlinear way** — the harm is necessarily **concave** (a little bit is devoid of harm, a lot can cause climatic disturbances)
- On epistemological grounds, we do not need to believe in anthropogenic climate change — to be ecologically conservative, we can use **convexity effects** to produce a risk management rule for pollution
- Simply, just as with size, **split your sources of pollution among many natural sources** — the harm from polluting with ten different sources is smaller than the equivalent pollution from a single source

### Concentration Effects

- Ancestral mechanisms for regulating concentration effects: contemporary humans go to stores and **purchase the same items** (tuna, coffee, tea, rice, mozzarella, Cabernet wine, olive oil) — items that appear not easily substitutable
- Because of sticky contemporary habits, cultural contagion, and rigidity of factories, we are led to **excessive use of specific products** — this concentration is harmful
- Extreme consumption of, say, tuna, can hurt other animals, mess with the ecosystem, and lead species to extinction — not only does the harm scale nonlinearly, but the **shortages lead to disproportional rises in prices**
- **Jennifer Dunne**, a complexity researcher who studies hunter-gatherers, examined evidence about the **Aleuts**, a North American native tribe — they exhibit a remarkable **lack of concentration** in their predatorial behavior, with a strategy of **prey switching**
- They were not as sticky and rigid as us in their habits — whenever they got low on a resource, they switched to another one, as if to **preserve the ecosystem** — they understood convexity effects (or rather, their habits did)
- **Globalization** has made contagions planetary — the entire world became a huge room with narrow exits and people rushing to the same doors, with accelerated harm
- Just as every child reads Harry Potter and joins Facebook, people when they get rich start to engage in the same activities and buy the same items — they drink Cabernet wine, hope to visit Venice and Florence, dream of buying a second home in the South of France — **tourist locations are becoming unbearable**

### The Nonlinearity of Wealth

- The fragilizing effect of contemporary globalization can be attributed to complexity, connectivity, and cultural contagions making economic gyrations much more severe — the classic switch to **Extremistan**
- But there is another effect: **wealth** — because of nonlinear scaling, more is different
- We are prone to make more severe errors because we are simply **wealthier** — just as projects of one hundred million dollars are more unpredictable and more likely to incur overruns than five-million-dollar ones
- Simply by being richer, the world is troubled with additional **unpredictability and fragility** — this comes with growth, at a country level (this Highly Dreamed-of GDP Growth)
- Even at an individual level, wealth means more headaches; we may need to work harder at **mitigating the complications arising from wealth** than we do at acquiring it

### Chapter 18 Conclusion

- Fragility in any domain — from a porcelain cup to an organism, to a political system, to the size of a firm, or to delays in airports — **resides in the nonlinear**
- **Discovery can be seen as an antideficit** — think of the exact opposite of airplane delays or project overruns — something that **benefits from uncertainty**
- Discovery presents the **mirror image** of what we saw as fragile, randomness-hating situations

## Chapter 19: The Philosopher's Stone and Its Inverse

> *They tell you when they are going bust — Gold is sometimes a special variety of lead*

- This chapter is a **deepening of the ideas of the previous one** — it will be denser and more technical, and Taleb says it should be skipped by the "enlightened reader"

### How to Detect Who Will Go Bust

- A method to detect fragility — the **inverse philosopher's stone**
- Illustrated with the story of **Fannie Mae**, the giant government-sponsored lending firm that collapsed leaving the United States taxpayer with hundreds of billions of dollars of losses (and still counting)
- In 2003, **Alex Berenson**, a *New York Times* journalist, came into Taleb's office with **secret risk reports of Fannie Mae** given by a defector — the report got into the guts of the methodology for risk calculation that only an insider can see
- Fannie Mae made its own risk calculations and disclosed what it wanted to whomever it wanted — only a defector could show the guts of how risk was calculated
- Looking at the report: a move upward in an economic variable led to **massive losses**, a move downward (opposite direction) led to **small profits** — further moves upward led to even larger additional losses and further moves downward to even smaller profits
- It looked exactly like the **story of the stone** — acceleration of harm was obvious, in fact monstrous
- Their blowup was inevitable: their exposures were severely **"concave"** — similar to the graph of traffic — losses accelerate as one deviates economic variables
- Fragility to one variable of this magnitude **implies fragility to all other parameters**
- Thanks to Berenson, *The New York Times* presented Taleb's concern — a smear campaign ensued, but nothing too notable
- The key: the **nonlinear is vastly more affected by extreme events** — and nobody was interested in extreme events since they had a mental block against them
- Taleb kept telling anyone who would listen, including taxi drivers, that Fannie Mae was **"sitting on a barrel of dynamite"** — people kept saying his opinion was wrong and unfounded (arguing the stock was going up)
- He also inferred that other institutions, almost all banks, were in the same situation — after checking similar institutions and seeing the problem was general, he realized a **total collapse of the banking system was a certainty**
- He was so certain he could not see straight and went back to the markets to get his revenge against the turkeys, as in the scene from *The Godfather* (III): "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
- Things happened as if planned by destiny — Fannie Mae went bust, along with other banks — it just took **a bit longer than expected**, no big deal

### Taleb's Discovery of the Fragility-Antifragility Measure

- The stupid part: he had **not seen the link between financial and general fragility** — nor did he use the term "fragility"; he didn't look at too many porcelain cups
- However, thanks to the episode, in the attic he had **a measure for fragility, hence antifragility**
- It all boils down to: figuring out if our miscalculations or misforecasts are on balance **more harmful than they are beneficial**, and how **accelerating** the damage is
- Exactly as in the story of the king: the damage from a **ten-kilogram stone is more than twice** the damage from a five-kilogram one — such **accelerating damage** means a large stone would eventually kill the person, and likewise a large market deviation would eventually kill the company

### The Fragility (and Antifragility) Detection Heuristic

- Once Taleb figured out that fragility was directly from **nonlinearity and convexity effects**, and that convexity was measurable, he got excited
- The technique — detecting **acceleration of harm** — applies to anything that entails decision making under uncertainty and risk management
- He suggested to the **International Monetary Fund** a measure of fragility to substitute for their measures of risk that they knew didn't work
- Most people in the risk business had been frustrated by the poor (random) performance of their models but didn't like the earlier stance of "don't use any model" — now there was **a risk measure**
- The technique, a simple heuristic called the **fragility (and antifragility) detection heuristic**, works as follows: say you want to check whether a town is overoptimized — you measure that when traffic increases by ten thousand cars, travel time grows by ten minutes; but if traffic increases by ten thousand *more* cars, travel time now extends by an extra **thirty minutes**
- Such **acceleration of traffic time** shows that traffic is fragile and you have too many cars — you need to reduce traffic until the acceleration becomes mild (acceleration = acute concavity = **negative convexity effect**)
- **Government deficits** are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions — every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate (particularly when the government has debt) makes deficits incrementally worse
- **Financial leverage** for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same effect — just as in a **Ponzi scheme**
- **Operational leverage** of a fragile company: if sales increase 10 percent, profits would increase less than they would decrease should sales drop 10 percent

### Collaboration with Raphael Douady

- Taleb used this technique intuitively to declare that Fannie Mae was on its way to the cemetery — it was easy to produce a rule of thumb
- With the IMF, he now had a simple measure with a stamp — but "experts" initially called it "trivial" (said by people who had never detected these risks before)
- He invited his friend **Raphael Douady** to collaborate in expressing this simple idea using the most opaque mathematical derivations with incomprehensible theorems
- Raphael, Bruno Dupire, and Taleb had been involved in an almost **two-decades-long continuous conversation** on how everything entailing risk can be seen with more rigor and clarity from the vantage point of an **option professional**
- Raphael and Taleb managed to prove the **link between nonlinearity, dislike of volatility, and fragility**
- Remarkably — if you can say something straightforward in a complicated manner with complex theorems, people take the idea very seriously; they got nothing but positive reactions and were told the detection heuristic was now **"intelligent"** (by the same people who had found it trivial)

### The Idea of Positive and Negative Model Error

- Taleb's true specialty: **error in models**
- In the transaction business, he used to make plenty of **errors of execution** — buy one thousand units and discover the next day he'd bought two thousand; if the price went up, a handsome profit; otherwise a large loss
- These errors are **in the long run neutral in effect** — they can affect you both ways, increase variance, but don't affect your business — there is no one-sidedness to them; they can be kept under control thanks to **size limits** (lots of small transactions, so errors remain small and "wash out")
- But this is **not the case with most things we build** — with errors related to things that are fragile, in the presence of **negative convexity effects**, there is a **one-way outcome** (negative)
- This class of errors tends to make planes land **later, not earlier**; wars tend to get **worse, not better**; variations (disturbances) tend to increase travel time from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus, **never shorten it**
- Some things, like traffic, do rarely experience the equivalent of **positive disturbances**
- This one-sidedness brings both **underestimation of randomness** and **underestimation of harm**, since one is more exposed to harm than benefit from error
- If in the long run we get as much variation in the source of randomness one way as the other, the harm would **severely outweigh** the benefits

### Classifying by the Triad

- This is the key to the Triad — we can classify things by three simple distinctions:
  1. Things that, in the long run, **like disturbances** (or errors) — antifragile
  2. Things that are **neutral** to them
  3. Things that **dislike** them — fragile
- Evolution likes disturbances; discovery likes disturbances
- Some forecasts are hurt by uncertainty — and like travel time, one needs a **buffer**
- Airlines figured out how to do it, but **not governments** when they estimate deficits
- This method is very general — Taleb even used it with **Fukushima-style computations** and realized how fragile their computation of small probabilities was — in fact **all small probabilities tend to be very fragile to errors**, as a small change in the assumptions can make the probability rise dramatically, from one per million to one per hundred — a **ten-thousand-fold underestimation**
- This method can show us where the math in economic models is bogus — which models are **fragile** and which are not — simply do a small change in the assumptions and look at how large the effect is; if there is **acceleration**, it implies that someone relying on the model blows up from Black Swan effects

> *Molto facile.*

- A detailed methodology to detect which results are bogus in economics — along with a discussion of small probabilities — is provided in the Appendix
- Much of what is taught in economics that has an equation, as well as econometrics, should be **immediately ditched** — which explains why economics is largely a **charlatanic profession**

> Fragilistas, *semper fragilisti*!

### How to Lose a Grandmother

- The following effect of nonlinearity: conditions under which **the average — the first order effect — does not matter**
- As the saying goes:

> *Do not cross a river if it is on average four feet deep.*

- You are informed that your grandmother will spend the next two hours at the very desirable average temperature of **seventy degrees Fahrenheit** (about 21°C) — excellent, you think, the optimal temperature for grandmothers
- But there is a second piece of data: your grandmother will spend the first hour at **zero degrees Fahrenheit** (around -18°C), and the second hour at **one hundred and forty degrees** (around 60°C) — for an average of the very desirable 70°F
- So you will most certainly end up with **no grandmother, a funeral, and possibly an inheritance**
- Temperature changes become **more and more harmful** as they deviate from seventy degrees — the variability turned out to be more important than the first piece of information (the average)
- The notion of average is of **no significance** when one is fragile to variations — the **dispersion** in possible thermal outcomes matters much more
- Your grandmother is fragile to **variations of temperature**, to the **volatility of the weather** — that second piece of information is the **second-order effect**, or more precisely, the **convexity effect**
- The notion of average can be a **Procrustean bed** — the information that the average temperature is 70°F does not simplify the situation for your grandmother; it is information squeezed into a Procrustean bed — and these are necessarily committed by scientific modelers, since a model is *by its very nature* a simplification
- You don't want the simplification to distort the situation to the point of being harmful

### Figure 16: Megafragility of Grandmother's Health

- **Figure 16** shows the fragility of the health of the grandmother to variations — health on the vertical axis, temperature on the horizontal — the shape **curves inward** — a "concave" shape, or **negative convexity effect**
- If the grandmother's response was "linear" (a straight line), then the harm of temperature below 70° would be offset by the benefits of temperature above it — but the fact is that health is **capped at a maximum**, otherwise she would keep improving
- General attributes of the grandmother's health response to temperature: (a) there is **nonlinearity** (the response is not a straight line), (b) it **curves inward** too much, and (c) the more nonlinear the response, the **less relevant the average**, and the more relevant the **stability around such average**

### Now the Philosopher's Stone

- Much of medieval thinking went into finding the **philosopher's stone** — chemistry is the child of alchemy, which consisted of looking into the chemical powers of substances
- The main efforts went into creating value by transforming metals into gold by the method of **transmutation** — the necessary substance was called the philosopher's stone (*lapis philosophorum*)
- Many people fell for it, including scholars like **Albertus Magnus, Isaac Newton, and Roger Bacon**, and great thinkers who were not quite scholars, such as **Paracelsus**
- The operation of transmutation was called the **Magnus Opus** — the great(est) work — Taleb truly believes that the operation he discusses — based on properties of optionality — is about as close as we can get to the philosopher's stone
- The following note helps understand: (a) the severity of the problem of **conflation** (mistaking the price of oil for geopolitics, or mistaking a profitable bet for good forecasting — not convexity of payoff and optionality), (b) why anything with **optionality** has a long-term advantage and how to measure it, and (c) an additional subtle property called **Jensen's inequality**

### The Traffic Example Revisited

- Recall the traffic example from Chapter 18: **90,000 cars** for an hour, then **110,000 cars** for the next one, for an average of 100,000, and traffic will be horrendous
- On the other hand, if we have **100,000 cars for both time periods**, traffic will be smooth and time in traffic short
- The number of cars is the **something** (a variable); traffic time is the **function of something** — the behavior of the function is such that the *function of something* becomes different from the *something* under nonlinearities
- Key principles of nonlinearity and volatility:
  - (a) The more **nonlinear**, the more the *function of something* divorces itself from the *something* — if traffic were linear, there would be no difference between 90,000/110,000 and 100,000/100,000
  - (b) The more **volatile** the something — the more uncertainty — the more the function divorces itself from the something — travel time depends more on the **volatility around the average** than the average itself — things degrade if there is unevenness of distribution
  - (c) If the function is **convex** (antifragile), then the average of the function of something is going to be **higher** than the function of the average of something — and the **reverse** when the function is concave (fragile)

### The Squaring Function Example (Convexity Bias)

- Assume the function is the **squaring function** (multiply a number by itself) — this is a convex function
- Take a conventional die (six sides) with a payoff equal to the number it lands on: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
- The square of the expected (average) payoff is then (1+2+3+4+5+6 divided by 6)² = 3.5² = **12.25** — the **function of the average** equals 12.25
- But the average of the function is: (1²+2²+3²+4²+5²+6²) divided by 6 = **15.17** — the **average of the function** equals 15.17
- Since squaring is a **convex function**, the average of the square payoff is **higher** than the square of the average payoff
- The difference between 15.17 and 12.25 is what Taleb calls the **hidden benefit of antifragility** — here, a **24 percent "edge"**
- There are two biases: one elementary **convexity effect** (leading to mistaking the properties of the average of something, here 3.5, for those of the convex function of something, here 15.17), and the second, more involved, in **mistaking an average of a function for the function of an average** (here 15.17 for 12.25) — the latter represents **optionality**
- Someone with a **linear payoff** needs to be right more than 50 percent of the time; someone with a **convex payoff**, much less — the hidden benefit of antifragility is that you can **guess worse than random** and still end up outperforming

> *This explains my statement that you can be dumb and antifragile and still do very well.*

- This hidden "convexity bias" comes from a mathematical property called **Jensen's inequality** — this is what the common discourse on innovation is missing
- If you ignore the convexity bias, you are missing a chunk of what makes the nonlinear world go round — and it is a fact that such an idea is missing from the discourse

### How to Transform Gold into Mud: The Inverse Philosopher's Stone

- Take the same example using the **square root** function (concave, but much less concave than the square function is convex)
- The square root of the expected (average) payoff is √3.5 = **1.87** — the **function of the average** equals 1.87
- But the average of the function is: (√1+√2+√3+√4+√5+√6) divided by 6 = **1.80** — the **average of the function** equals 1.80
- The difference is called the **"negative convexity bias"** (or "concavity bias") — the hidden harm of fragility is that you need to be **much, much better than random** in your prediction and knowing where you are going, just to offset the negative effect

### Summary of Optionality and Convexity

- If you have **favorable asymmetries**, or **positive convexity** (options being a special case), then in the long run you will do reasonably well, **outperforming the average** in the presence of uncertainty
- The more uncertainty, the more role for optionality to kick in, and the more you will outperform — this property is very central to life

### Footnotes on Measurement and Model Risk

- The method of measuring convexity does not require a good model for risk measurement — you can use a ruler that you know is wrong; it can still tell you about rate of growth (acceleration) even if it can't measure absolute height
- **Convexity is about acceleration** — measuring convexity effects to detect model errors means that even if the model is wrong, it can tell you if an entity is fragile and by how much — we are only looking for **second-order effects**

## Book VI: Via Negativa

## Chapter 20: Via Negativa

### The Apophatic Method

- Recall that we had no name for the color blue but managed rather well without it — we stayed for a long part of our history **culturally, not biologically, color blind**
- Before the composition of Chapter 1, we did not have a name for **antifragility**, yet systems have relied on it effectively in the absence of human intervention
- There are many things without words, matters that we know and can act on but cannot describe directly — almost anything around us of significance is **hard to grasp linguistically** — and in fact the more powerful, the more incomplete our linguistic grasp
- If we cannot express what something is exactly, we can say something about what it is *not* — the indirect rather than the direct expression
- The **"apophatic"** focuses on what cannot be said directly in words, from the Greek *apophasis* (saying no, or mentioning without mentioning)
- The method began as an avoidance of direct description, leading to a focus on **negative description** — what is called in Latin **via negativa**, the negative way
- *Via negativa* does not try to express what God is — it just lists what God is **not** and proceeds by the process of **elimination**
- The idea is mostly associated with the mystical theologian **Pseudo-Dionysos the Areopagite** — he was some obscure Near Easterner by the name of Dionysos who wrote powerful mystical treatises and was confused with Dionysos the Areopagite, a judge in Athens converted by Paul the Apostle
- **Neoplatonists** were followers of Plato's ideas, focused on Plato's forms (abstract objects with distinct existence) — Pseudo-Dionysos was the disciple of **Proclus** the Neoplatonist (himself the student of Syrianus, another Syrian Neoplatonist)
- Proclus was known to repeat the metaphor that **statues are carved by subtraction**

> *Michelangelo was asked by the pope about the secret of his genius, particularly how he carved the statue of David. His answer was: "It's simple. I just remove everything that is not David."*

- The reader might recognize the logic behind the **barbell** — remember from the logic of the barbell that it is necessary to **first remove fragilities**

### Where Is the Charlatan?

- The **interventionista** focuses on positive action — *doing* — just like positive definitions, acts of commission are respected and glorified by our primitive minds
- Naive government interventions that end in disaster are followed by generalized complaints, which lead to more naive government interventions — acts of **omission** (*not* doing something) are not considered acts and do not appear to be part of one's mission
- Taleb's lifelong simple heuristic: **charlatans are recognizable** in that they will give you only positive advice, exploiting our gullibility and sucker-proneness for recipes that hit you in a flash as just obvious, then evaporate as you forget them
- Just look at the "how to" books with "Ten Steps for—" in their title (enrichment, weight loss, making friends, innovation, getting elected, building muscles, finding a husband, running an orphanage, etc.)
- Yet in practice it is the **negative** that's used by the pros, those selected by evolution: chess grandmasters usually win by **not losing**; people become rich by **not going bust**; religions are mostly about **interdicts**; the learning of life is about **what to avoid**
- You reduce most of your personal risks of accident thanks to a **small number of measures**
- Being fooled by randomness: in most circumstances fraught with a high degree of randomness, one cannot really tell if a successful person has skills — but we can pretty much predict the negative, that **a person totally devoid of skills will eventually fail**

### Subtractive Knowledge

- The greatest — and most robust — contribution to knowledge consists in **removing what we think is wrong** — **subtractive epistemology**
- In life, antifragility is reached by **not** being a sucker — in *Peri mystikes theologias*, Pseudo-Dionysos did not use these exact words, nor did he discuss disconfirmation, but in Taleb's view he figured out this subtractive epistemology and asymmetries in knowledge
- Taleb calls **"Platonicity"** the love of some crisp abstract forms, the theoretical forms and universals that make us blind to the mess of reality and cause Black Swan effects — then he realized there was an asymmetry: he truly believes in Platonic ideas when they come in **reverse**, like **negative universals**
- The central tenet of this epistemology: **we know a lot more what is wrong than what is right** — or, phrased according to the fragile/robust classification, **negative knowledge** (what is wrong, what does not work) is more robust to error than **positive knowledge** (what is right, what works)
- **Knowledge grows by subtraction** much more than by addition — what we know today might turn out to be wrong but what we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right, at least not easily
- If I spot a black swan (not capitalized), I can be quite certain that "all swans are white" is wrong — but even if I have never seen a black swan, I can never hold such a statement to be true
- Since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it, **disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation**
- This idea has been associated with philosopher **Karl Popper** — Taleb quite mistakenly thought he was its originator (though he is at the origin of the idea on the fundamental inability to predict the course of history)
- The notion is vastly more ancient — it was one of the central tenets of the **skeptical-empirical school of medicine** of the postclassical era in the Eastern Mediterranean, and well known to a group of nineteenth-century French scholars who rediscovered these works
- As you can see, we can link this to the general tableaus of **positive (additive)** and **negative (subtractive)**: negative knowledge is more robust
- **Popper's limitation**: he has been criticized for his treatment of disconfirmation as hard, unequivocal, black-and-white — it is not clear-cut whether an experiment failed to produce results because of "falsifying" the theory, the failure of tools, bad luck, or fraud by the scientist
- But he missed that if an incompetent surgeon is operating on a brain, one can safely predict serious damage — yet such subtractive representation of the future is perfectly in line with his idea of disconfirmation
- **Popper's masterpiece**, *The Poverty of Historicism*, presents the limits of forecasting and shows the impossibility of an acceptable representation of the future — but he missed the point that if an incompetent surgeon is operating on a brain, one can safely predict serious damage, even the death of the patient — what he calls falsification of a theory should lead, in practice, to the **breaking of the object** of its application

### Via Negativa in Political Systems

- In political systems, a good mechanism is one that helps **remove the bad guy** — it's not about what to do or who to put in — for the bad guy can cause more harm than the collective actions of good ones
- **Jon Elster** recently wrote a book with the telling title *Preventing Mischief*, basing negative action on **Bentham's idea** that "the art of the legislator is limited to the prevention of everything that might prevent the development of their [members of the assembly] liberty and their intelligence"
- *Via negativa* is part of classical wisdom — for the Arab scholar and religious leader **Ali Bin Abi-Taleb** (no relation), keeping one's distance from an ignorant person is equivalent to keeping company with a wise man

> *"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things."* — Steve Jobs

### Barbells, Again

- **Subtractive knowledge** is a form of barbell — critically, it is **convex**: what is wrong is quite robust; what you don't know is fragile and speculative, but you do not take it seriously so you make sure it does not harm you in case it turns out to be false
- Another application of *via negativa* lies in the **less-is-more** idea

### Less Is More

- The less-is-more idea in decision making can be traced to **Spyros Makridakis, Robyn Dawes, Dan Goldstein, and Gerd Gigerenzer**, who have all found that **simpler methods** for forecasting and inference can work much, much better than complicated ones
- Their simple rules of thumb are not perfect, but are designed to not be perfect — adopting some intellectual humility and abandoning the aim at sophistication can yield powerful effects
- **Goldstein and Gigerenzer** coined the notion of **"fast and frugal" heuristics** that make good decisions despite limited time, knowledge, and computing power
- The less-is-more heuristic fell into Taleb's work in two places: (1) in domains of **extreme effects** where the rare event plays a disproportionate share — just worry about **Black Swan exposures** and life is easy; (2) *less is more* has proved shockingly easy to find and apply — and "robust" to mistakes and change of minds
- There may not be an easily identifiable cause for a large share of the problems, but often there is an easy solution (good enough) — sometimes identifiable with the **naked eye** rather than complicated analyses

### The Eighty/Twenty Rule and Extremistan Effects

- The **eighty/twenty idea** (based on **Vilfredo Pareto's** discovery more than a century ago): 20 percent of the people in Italy owned 80 percent of the land, and vice versa — of these 20 percent, 4 percent would have owned around 64 percent; less than 1 percent representing about 50 percent of the total
- These describe **winner-take-all Extremistan effects** — very general, from the distribution of wealth to book sales per author
- We are moving into the far more uneven distribution of **99/1** across many things that used to be 80/20: 99 percent of Internet traffic is attributable to less than 1 percent of sites, 99 percent of book sales come from less than 1 percent of authors
- Almost everything contemporary has **winner-take-all effects**, which includes sources of harm and benefits — accordingly, **1 percent modification** of systems can lower fragility (or increase antifragility) by about **99 percent** — all it takes is a few steps, very few steps, often at low cost
- Examples: a small number of **homeless people** cost the states a disproportionate share of the bills; a small number of **employees** in a corporation cause the most problems; a small number of **customers** generate a large share of the revenues
- **Ezekiel Emanuel** showed that half the population accounts for less than 3 percent of health care costs, with the sickest 10 percent consuming 64 percent of the total pie
- **Bent Flyvbjerg** showed in his *Black Swan management* idea that the bulk of cost overruns by corporations are simply attributable to large technology projects

> *As they say in the mafia, just work on removing the pebble in your shoe.*

- In some domains like **real estate**, problems and solutions are crisply summarized by a heuristic: **"location, location, and location"** — much of the rest takes care of itself

### More Data, Less Predictability

- Yet people want more data to "solve problems" — Taleb testified in Congress against a project to fund a crisis forecasting project — we have **never had more data** than we have now, yet have **less predictability than ever**
- More data — such as paying attention to the eye colors of people crossing the street — can make you miss the **big truck**
- When you cross the street, you remove data, anything but the essential threat

> *As Paul Valéry once wrote: que de choses il faut ignorer pour agir — how many things one should disregard in order to act.*

- **Convincing and confident disciplines** (physics) tend to use little statistical backup, while **political science and economics**, which have never produced anything of note, are full of elaborate statistics and statistical "evidence"
- The situation in science is similar to detective novels: the person with the **largest number of alibis** turns out to be the guilty one
- You do not need reams of paper full of data to destroy the megatons of papers using statistics in economics: the simple argument that **Black Swans and tail events run the socioeconomic world** — and these events cannot be predicted — is sufficient to invalidate their statistics

### The Invisible Gorilla and Decision Making

- **Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons**, in their book *The Invisible Gorilla*, show how people watching a video of a basketball game, when diverted with attention-absorbing details such as counting passes, can completely **miss a gorilla stepping into the middle of the court**
- Taleb had been intuitively using the less-is-more idea as an aid in decision making (contrary to putting pros and cons side by side on a computer screen)
- If you have **more than one reason** to do something (choose a doctor, hire a gardener, marry a person, go on a trip), **just don't do it** — it does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to **convince yourself** to do something
- **Obvious decisions** (robust to error) require no more than a **single reason**
- The French army had a heuristic to reject excuses for absenteeism for **more than one reason** (like death of grandmother, cold virus, and being bitten by a boar)
- If someone attacks a book or idea using **more than one argument**, you know it is not real — nobody says "he is a criminal, he killed many people, and he also has bad table manners and bad breath and is a very poor driver"

### Bergson's Razor

- Taleb often follows what he calls **Bergson's razor**: "A philosopher should be known for one single idea, not more"
- **Paul Valéry** once asked Einstein if he carried a notebook to write down ideas — "I never have ideas" was the reply (he just did not have trivial ideas)
- Heuristic: if someone has a **long bio**, skip him — if someone has a résumé that "can cover more than two or three lives," skip him
- When told that someone has three hundred academic papers and twenty-two honorary doctorates, but no other single compelling contribution or main idea behind it, Taleb avoids him like **the bubonic plague**

## Chapter 20: Time and Fragility

> *Prophecy, like knowledge, is subtractive, not additive — The Lindy effect, or how the old prevails over the new, especially in technology, no matter what they say in California — Prophecy not a recommended and voluntary career*

### The Old Is Superior to the New

- Antifragility implies — contrary to initial instinct — that **the old is superior to the new**, and much more than you think
- No matter how something looks to your intellectual machinery, or how well or poorly it narrates, **time will know more about its fragilities** and break it when necessary
- Taleb exposes a contemporary disease linked to interventionism called **neomania**, which brings fragility but he believes may be treatable if one is patient enough
- What survives must be good at serving some (mostly hidden) purpose that time can see but our eyes and logical faculties can't capture
- In this chapter, the notion of **fragility** is used as a central driver of prediction
- Recall the foundational asymmetry: the **antifragile benefits** from volatility and disorder, the **fragile is harmed** — well, **time is the same as disorder**

### From Simonides to Jensen

- As an exercise in the use of the distinction between fragility and antifragility, let us play prophet — it is **not a good career choice** unless you have a thick skin, a good circle of friends, little access to the Internet, a library with ancient proverbs, and the ability to derive personal benefits from your prophecy
- As shown from the track record of the prophets: before you are proven right, you will be **reviled**; after you are proven right, you will be **hated** for a while, or worse, your ideas will appear to be "trivial" thanks to **retrospective distortion**
- This makes it far more convincing to follow the **Fat Tony method** of focusing on shekels more than recognition
- Twentieth-century intellectuals who embraced the wrong ideas (Communism, Stalinism) remained **fashionable** — while those like political philosopher **Raymond Aron**, who saw the problems, got short shrift both before and after being acknowledged as right
- Close your eyes and imagine your future surroundings in five, ten, or twenty-five years — odds are your imagination will produce *new* things: **innovation, improvements, killer technologies** — these common concepts are nonsense both **empirically and philosophically**
- Why? Your imagination will be **adding things** to the present world — but the correct approach according to the notions of fragility and antifragility is to **take away** from the future, reduce from it, simply subtract things that do not belong to the coming times
- **Via negativa**: what is fragile will eventually break; and luckily, we can easily tell what is fragile — **positive Black Swans** are more unpredictable than negative ones

> *"Time has sharp teeth that destroy everything,"* declared the sixth-century (B.C.) poet Simonides of Ceos.

- From Ovid (*tempus edax rerum* — time devours everything) to Franco-Russian poetess **Elsa Triolet** ("time burns but leaves no ashes")
- Thanks to convexity effects, we can put a little bit of science in these and produce our own taxonomy: **the fragile will be devoured the fastest** by inexorable time
- The fragile will eventually break — and we are capable of figuring out what is fragile — even what we believe is antifragile will eventually break, but it should take much, **much longer** to do so (wine does well with time, but up to a point; and not if you put it in the crater of a volcano)
- The verse by Simonides continues with the stipulation **"even the most solid"** — he had the adumbration that the most solid will be swallowed with more difficulty, hence last — naturally, he did not think that something could be antifragile, hence never swallowed
- The **via negativa method of prophecy** is the only valid one: there is no other way to produce a forecast without being a turkey — in the complex environment in which we live, new technologies will emerge but what is currently fragile **will be replaced** by something else — but this "something else" is unpredictable
- The most fragile is the **predictive** — in other words, those who underestimate Black Swans will eventually exit the population
- **Longer-term predictions are more reliable** than short-term ones (an apparent paradox): one can be quite certain that what is Black Swan-prone will be eventually swallowed by history since time augments the probability — on the other hand, typical predictions (not involving the currently fragile) **degrade with time**; in the presence of nonlinearities, the longer the forecast the worse its accuracy

### Learning to Subtract

- Consider the **futuristic projections** made throughout the past century and a half in literary novels (Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, George Orwell) or by scientists/futurists — the tools that currently dominate the world (the Internet, the wheel on the suitcase) were **completely missing** from these forecasts
- The major error is not here: almost everything that was imagined **never took place**, except for a few overexploited anecdotes (Hero the Alexandrian's steam engine, Leonardo da Vinci's assault vehicle)
- Our world looks too close to theirs, much closer than they ever imagined — and we tend to be blind to that fact — there seems to be **no correcting mechanism** for forecasting a highly technocratic future
- There may be a selection bias: those who engage in producing these accounts of the future will tend to have (incurable and untreatable) **neomania**, the love of the modern for its own sake

### The Dinner at the Restaurant (Technology Constancy)

- Tonight Taleb will meet friends in a **restaurant** (tavernas have existed for at least twenty-five centuries), wearing **shoes** hardly different from those worn fifty-three hundred years ago by the mummified man discovered in the Austrian Alps
- At the restaurant: **silverware** (a Mesopotamian technology), **wine** (in use for at least six millennia), **glasses** (an innovation claimed by Lebanese compatriots, glass objects sold as trinkets for at least twenty-nine hundred years), **artisanal cheese** (unchanged for several centuries), food prepared using **fire** and kitchen implements unchanged since the Romans
- He will be sitting on a **(at least) three-thousand-year-old** device: the **chair** — and will not be repairing to the restaurant with a flying motorcycle, but walking or taking a **cab** from a century-old technology, driven by an immigrant
- **David Edgerton** showed that in the early 2000s we produce two and a half times as many **bicycles** as cars and invest most of our technological resources in **maintaining existing equipment** or refining old technologies
- One of the most consequential technologies seems to be the one people talk about the least: the **condom** — it has been undergoing meaningful improvements, with the precise aim of being less and less noticeable

### The Prime Error in Imagining the Future

- The **prime error** when asked to imagine the future: we take the present as a baseline, then produce a speculative destiny by adding new technologies and products to it, interpolating from past developments
- We represent society according to our **utopia of the moment**, largely driven by our wishes — except for a few doomsayers, the future will be largely inhabited by our desires
- We tend to **over-technologize** the future and underestimate the might of the equivalent of small wheels on suitcases that will be staring at us for the next millennia
- Cooking utensils from **Pompeii** are hardly different from those found in today's good kitchens — a powerful illustration of technological constancy

### The Blindness of Technothinkers

- After leaving finance, Taleb attended fashionable technology conferences attended by pre-rich, post-rich technology people and the new category of **technology intellectuals**
- These conferences, while colorful and slick with computerized images and fancy animations, felt **depressing** — it was not just their additive approach to the future (failure to subtract the fragile rather than add to destiny)
- It was their blindness by **uncompromising neomania** and a profound **lack of elegance**
- Technothinkers tend to have an **"engineering mind"** — to put it less politely, they have autistic tendencies: lack of charm, interest in objects instead of persons, neglect of their looks, precision at the expense of applicability, and an absence of **literary culture**
- The absence of literary culture is actually a **marker of future blindness** because it is usually accompanied by a denigration of history, a byproduct of unconditional neomania
- Outside of science fiction, **literature is about the past** — we do not learn physics or biology from medieval textbooks, but we still read Homer, Plato, or the very modern Shakespeare
- We cannot talk about sculpture without knowledge of Phidias, Michelangelo, or the great **Canova** — these are in the past, not in the future
- By setting foot into a **museum**, the aesthetically minded person is connecting with the elders — the past, properly handled, is a much better teacher about the properties of the future than the present
- To understand the future, you do not need technoautistic jargon or obsession with "killer apps" — you need: respect for the past, curiosity about the historical record, a hunger for the wisdom of the elders, and a grasp of **"heuristics"** — the often unwritten rules of thumb determining survival

### Technology at Its Best

- Technology can cancel the effect of bad technologies by **self-subtraction**

> Technology is at its best when it is invisible.

- Technology is of greatest benefit when it **displaces the deleterious**, unnatural, alienating, and inherently fragile preceding technology
- Many modern applications that have survived today came to disrupt the **deleterious effects of the philistinism of modernity**, particularly the twentieth century: the large multinational bureaucratic corporation with "empty suits" at the top; the isolated nuclear family with the television set; car-designed suburban society; the militaristic nation-state with border controls; the dictatorship on thought and culture by established media; large corporations controlling markets (now threatened by the Internet); pseudorigor ("press 1 for English")
- The Internet removed many **unnatural elements** around us — the absence of paperwork makes bureaucracy more palatable; a computer virus will wipe out all records and free people from their past mistakes

### Reversing Technology (Barefoot Shoes)

- We are now using technology to **reverse technology** — the shoe industry, after spending decades "engineering" the perfect walking and running shoe with "support" mechanisms and material for cushioning, is now selling shoes that replicate being **barefoot**
- These unobtrusive shoes' only claimed function is to **protect our feet from the elements**, not to dictate how we walk as the modernistic mission was — they are selling us the calloused feet of a hunter-gatherer
- Walking in nature with these shoes feels like waking up to a **new dimension** while feeling the three dimensions of the terrain — regular shoes feel like casts that separate us from the environment
- The technology is in the **sole, not the shoe** — the new soles can be both robust and very thin, allowing the foot to hug the ground as if one were barefoot
- Taleb's best discovery is an Italian-looking **moccasin made in Brazil** that allows him to both run on stones and go to dinner in restaurants
- Perhaps they should just sell us **reinforced waterproof socks** (in effect, what the Alpine fellow had), but it would not be very profitable

### The Tablet as Return to Roots

- The great use of the **tablet computer** (notably the iPad) is that it allows us to return to Babylonian and Phoenician roots of writing and taking notes on a tablet (which is how it started)
- One can now jot down handwritten, or rather fingerwritten, notes — it is much more soothing to **write longhand** instead of having to go through the agency of a keyboard
- It may be a natural property of technology to **only want to be displaced by itself**

## Chapter 20: The Lindy Effect

### The Lindy Effect Defined

- Time to get more technical — a distinction is helpful: separate the **perishable** (humans, single items) from the **nonperishable**, the potentially perennial
- The **nonperishable** is anything that does not have an organic unavoidable expiration date — the perishable is typically an object; the nonperishable has an **informational nature** to it
- A single car is perishable, but the **automobile as a technology** has survived about a century (and we can speculate should survive another one)
- Humans die, but their **genes** — a code — do not necessarily; the physical book is perishable — say, a specific copy of the Old Testament — but its **contents** are not, as they can be expressed into another physical book
- The **Lebanese dialect** illustration: when you see a young and an old human, you can be confident that the younger will survive the elder; with something nonperishable like a technology, that is **not the case**
- Two possibilities: either both are expected to have the same additional life expectancy (the case of **exponential** probability distribution), or the old is expected to have a **longer** expectancy than the young, in proportion to their relative age

### Table 6: Domains and Comparison of Life Expectancy

- **Perishable** (life of humans and other animals): Gaussian distribution — the young is expected to live longer than the old
- **Non-perishable informational** (lifetime of species): Exponential — both the young and old have equivalent life expectancy
- **Lindy Effect** (non-perishable informational: life of intellectual production, lifetime of genera): **Power law** — the old is expected to stay longer than the young in proportion to their age

### The Core Lindy Principle

- Building on the so-called Lindy effect in the version later developed by **Benoît Mandelbrot**:

> *For the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy. For the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy.*

- The longer a technology lives, the longer it can be expected to live
- Example: a man who is **40 years old** — actuarial tables predict he has an extra 44 years to go; next year at 41, he will have a little more than 43 years to go — every year that elapses **reduces** his life expectancy by about a year (a little less than a year)
- The **opposite** applies to nonperishable items: if a book has been in print for **forty years**, expect it to be in print for another forty years; if it survives another decade, then it will be expected to be in print another **fifty years**
- Things that have been around for a long time are not "aging" like persons, but **"aging" in reverse** — every year that passes without extinction **doubles** the additional life expectancy
- The **robustness** of an item is proportional to its life!

### Richard Gott and Broadway Shows

- Physicist **Richard Gott** applied completely different reasoning to state that whatever we observe in a randomly selected way is likely to be neither in the beginning nor in the end of its life, most likely in its **middle**
- His argument was criticized for being incomplete, but by testing it he tested the principle that the expected life of an item is proportional to its past life
- Gott made a list of **Broadway shows** on May 17, 1993 and predicted that the longest-running ones would last longest, and vice versa — he was proven right with **95 percent accuracy**
- As a child, he had visited both the **Great Pyramid** (fifty-seven hundred years old) and the **Berlin Wall** (twelve years old), and correctly guessed the former would outlive the latter
- The proportionality of life expectancy does not need to be tested explicitly — it is the direct result of **"winner-take-all" effects** in longevity

### Two Common Mistakes About the Lindy Effect

- **Mistake 1: The counterexample fallacy** — people present counterexamples of technology currently seen as inefficient and dying (telephone land lines, print newspapers, paper receipts for tax purposes) and get angry
- Taleb's argument is not about *every* technology but about **life expectancy**, which is simply a probabilistically derived average
- Analogy: if a forty-year-old has terminal pancreatic cancer, one no longer estimates his life expectancy using unconditional insurance tables — likewise, the World Wide Web being less than about twenty years old will *only* have another twenty to go as a **noisy estimator** that should work on average, not in every case
- In general, the older the technology, not only the longer it is expected to last, but the **more certainty** one can attach to such a statement

> Remember the following principle: I am not saying that *all* technologies do not age, only that those technologies that were prone to aging are already dead.

- **Mistake 2: The "young" technology fallacy** — believing one would be acting "young" by adopting a "young" technology, revealing both a logical error and mental bias
- It leads to the **inversion of the power of generational contributions**, producing the illusion of the contribution of the new generations over the old — statistically, the "young" do almost nothing
- Loving things historical is not acting "old" — by loving the classics ("older"), one would be acting **"older" than** if interested in "younger" medieval themes
- A technology, being informational rather than physical, **does not age organically** like humans — the wheel is not "old" in the sense of experiencing degeneracy

### The Young and Progress

- The idea of "young" and "old" attached to certain crowd behavior is even more dangerous — if those who don't watch prepackaged 18-minute hyped-up lectures on the Web paid attention to people in their teens and twenties, they would be thinking differently
- Much progress comes from the young because of their relative **freedom from the system** and courage to take action that older people lose as they become trapped in life
- It is precisely the young who propose ideas that are **fragile** — not because they are young, but because most **unseasoned ideas are fragile**
- Someone who sells "futuristic" ideas will not make a lot of money selling the value of the past — **new technology is easier to hype up**

### Teaching Children for the Future

- Paul Doolan from Zurich asked how to teach children skills for the twenty-first century since we do not know which skills will be needed
- Taleb's answer, an elegant application of Karl Popper's error of historicism: make them **read the classics** — the future is in the past

> *He who does not have a past has no future.* — Arabic proverb

### A Few Mental Biases

- Application of the **fooled by randomness** effect: information has a nasty property — it hides failures
- Many people are drawn to financial markets after hearing success stories of someone getting rich in the stock market — but since failures are buried, investors are led to **overestimate their chances of success**
- The same applies to novels: we do not see the wonderful novels that are completely out of print — we confuse the **necessary and the causal**: because all surviving technologies have some obvious benefits, we are led to believe all technologies offering obvious benefits will survive
- Another mental bias: the overhyping of technology comes from the fact that we notice **change, not statics** — the classic example discovered by **Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky** applies to wealth
- If you announce to someone "you lost $10,000," he will be much more upset than if you tell him "your portfolio value, which was $785,000, is now $775,000" — our brains have a predilection for **shortcuts**, and the variation is easier to notice (and store) than the entire record
- This psychological heuristic, the error of **variation in place of total**, is quite pervasive even with matters that are visual
- We rely more on **water** than on cell phones, but because water does not change and cell phones do, we are prone to thinking that cell phones play a larger role than they do
- Because new generations are more aggressive with technology, we notice that they try more things, but we ignore that these implementations **don't usually stick** — most "innovations" are failures, just as most books are flops

### Neomania and Treadmill Effects

- Driving on the highway in your two-year-old Japanese car, you are overtaken by the latest version that looks markedly different — and markedly better? **Markedly better?**
- The bumper is slightly larger, the taillights wider — other than cosmetic details (and perhaps hidden technical improvements) representing less than a few percentage points in variation, the car **looks the same**
- You just see the lights and feel you are due an **upgrade** — costing about a third of the price of a new vehicle, all motivated by small, mostly cosmetic variations
- Switching cars is a small cost compared to switching **computers** — the recovery value of an old computer is negligible
- With Apple Mac computers: you just bought a new version, the person on the plane next to you has an older version that has a family resemblance but looks inferior — you forget the days when you had the same model and were **thrilled** with it
- With so many technologically driven and modernistic items, we notice **differences between versions** rather than commonalities — we rapidly tire of what we have, continuously searching for versions 2.0 and similar iterations
- These impulses to buy new things that will eventually lose their novelty are called **treadmill effects** — studied by Danny Kahneman and his peers as the psychology of **hedonic states**
- People acquire a new item, feel *more satisfied* after an initial boost, then rapidly **revert to their baseline** of well-being — when you "upgrade," you feel a boost of satisfaction with *changes* in technology, then get used to it and start hunting for the *new* new thing

### The Artisanal vs. the Technological

- We don't incur the same treadmilling techno-dissatisfaction with **classical art, older furniture** — whatever we do not put in the category of the technological
- You may have an oil painting and a flat-screen TV in the same room — the oil painting is an imitation of a classic Flemish scene; you are not eager to upgrade the painting but certain that your **flat-screen TV will be donated** to the local chapter of some kidney foundation
- Same with **dishes** — recall that we try to replicate nineteenth-century dinner customs; there is at least one domain in which we do not try to optimize matters
- Taleb writes longhand using a **seasoned fountain pen** — many of his pens are old enough to cross decades; he prefers **Clairefontaine paper and notebooks** that have hardly changed since his early childhood
- But when transcribing his writing into electronic form, he worries that his Mac computer may not be the best tool and plans to upgrade

### The On-Off Switch Heuristic

- There may be a heuristic that helps put items in categories: the **electronic on-off switch** — whatever has an "off" or "on" switch that needs to be turned off before being yelled at by the flight attendant will necessarily be in one category (but not the opposite: not as many items without an on-off switch will be prone to neomania)
- For items without an on-off switch, focus on **variations** with attendant neomania
- Consider the difference between the **artisanal** and the **industrial** — what is artisanal has the love of the maker infused in it, and tends to satisfy; we don't have this nagging impression of incompleteness we encounter with electronics
- Whatever is **technological** happens to be fragile — articles made by an artisan cause fewer treadmill effects; they tend to have some **antifragility** (recall how artisanal shoes take months before becoming comfortable)
- Items with an **on-off switch** tend to have no such redeeming antifragility

### Architecture and the Irreversible Neomania

- There is evolutionary warfare between architects producing a compounded form of **neomania**
- The problem with modernistic — and functional — architecture is that it is **not fragile enough to break physically**, so these buildings stick out just to torture our consciousness — you cannot exercise your prophetic powers by leaning on their fragility

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up in Urban Planning

- Urban planning demonstrates the central property of the **top-down effect**: top-down is usually irreversible, so mistakes tend to stick; whereas bottom-up is **gradual and incremental**, with creation and destruction along the way, though presumably with a positive slope
- Things that grow in a natural way, whether cities or individual houses, have a **fractal quality** to them — like everything alive, all organisms (lungs, trees) grow in some form of self-guided but tame randomness
- **Fractal** (Mandelbrot's insight): entails both jaggedness and a form of self-similarity ("self-affinity"), such as trees spreading into branches that look like small trees, and smaller branches that look like a slightly modified but recognizable version of the whole
- Everything in nature is fractal, jagged, and rich in detail — the **smooth**, by comparison, belongs to Euclidian geometry we study in school, simplified shapes that lose this layer of wealth
- Contemporary architecture is smooth, even when it tries to look whimsical — what is **top-down is generally unwrinkled** (unfractal) and feels dead

### Gaudi and Naturalistic Architecture

- Sometimes modernism can take a **naturalistic turn**, then stop in its tracks — **Gaudi's buildings** in Barcelona, from around the turn of the twentieth century, are inspired by nature and rich architecture (Baroque and Moorish)
- A rent-controlled apartment in a Gaudi building felt like an improved cavern with **rich, jagged details** — wealth of details, ironically, leads to inner peace
- Yet Gaudi's idea went nowhere except in promoting modernism in its unnatural and naive versions: later modernistic structures are smooth and **completely stripped of fractal jaggedness**
- White walls with sharp corners and **Euclidian angles** and crisp shapes strain us — once built, there is no way to get rid of them; almost everything built since World War II has an **unnatural smoothness** to it

### The Harm of Modernistic Buildings

- For some, these buildings cause more than aesthetic harm — many **Romanians** are bitter about Ceausescu's destruction of traditional villages replaced by modern high-rises
- **Neomania and dictatorship** are an explosive combination — in France, some blame the modernistic architecture of housing projects for the immigrant riots
- Christopher Caldwell wrote about the unnatural living conditions: **"Le Corbusier** called houses 'machines for living.' France's housing projects became machines for alienation."

### Jane Jacobs and the City as Organism

- **Jane Jacobs**, the New York urban activist, took a heroic stance as a political-style resistant against neomania in architecture and urban planning
- The modernistic dream was carried by **Robert Moses**, who wanted to improve New York by razing tenements and installing large roads and highways — committing a greater crime against natural order than **Haussmann**, who removed entire neighborhoods of Paris for the "Grand Boulevards"
- Jacobs stood against tall buildings as they deform the experience of urban living, which is conducted at **street level** — her bone with Robert Moses: highways and engines for travel suck life out of the city — a city should be devoted to **pedestrians**
- The **machine-organism dichotomy**: to Jacobs the city is an organism; for Moses it is a machine to be improved upon
- Moses had plans to raze the **West Village**; thanks to Jacobs' petitions and unremitting resistance, the neighborhood — the prettiest in Manhattan — has survived nearly intact
- Some of Moses' projects were beneficial, such as the **parks and beaches** now accessible to the middle class thanks to the highways

### London's Traffic and the Appeal of Old Cities

- The speed of traveling in London is equal to what it was a century and a half ago, if not slower — the same principle about municipal properties applies: neighborhoods are villages and **need to remain villages**
- London has so much traffic because people **wanted to be there** — the costs were exceeded by the benefits; more than a third of residents are foreign-born, and most high net worth individuals get their starter pied-à-terre in Central London
- The **absence of large avenues** and absence of a dominating state is part of its appeal — nobody would buy a pied-à-terre in **Brasilia**, the perfectly top-down city built from scratch on a map
- The most expensive neighborhoods in Paris today (the Sixth Arrondissement or Île Saint-Louis) were the ones **left alone** by nineteenth-century renovators

### Buildings Evolve

- The best argument against **teleological design**: even after they are built, buildings keep incurring mutations as if they needed to slowly evolve and be taken over by the dynamical environment — they change colors, shapes, windows, and character
- In his book *How Buildings Learn*, **Stewart Brand** shows in pictures how buildings change through time, as if they needed to metamorphose into unrecognizable shapes — strangely, buildings when erected do not account for the **optionality of future alterations**

### Wall to Wall Windows

- The skepticism about architectural modernism is not unconditional — some elements are an improvement: **floor-to-ceiling windows** in a rural environment expose us to nature, here again technology making itself (literally) invisible
- In the past, window size was dictated by **thermal considerations** (heat escaped quickly from windows); much French architecture was also a response to the **tax on windows** installed after the Revolution
- Modern technology allows us to **reverse from the smooth stone to the rich fractal and natural** — Benoît Mandelbrot wrote in front of a window overlooking trees, craving fractal aesthetics so much that the alternative would have been inconceivable
- Now an entire wall can be **transparent** and face lush and densely forested areas — as expressed by Oswald Spengler, civilization goes from plants to stone, from the fractal to the Euclidian; we are now moving back

### Metrification

- One example of the neomania of states: the campaign for **metrification** — the use of the metric system to replace "archaic" ones on grounds of efficiency
- **Warwick Cairns**, a fellow similar to Jane Jacobs, has been fighting in courts to let market farmers in Britain keep selling bananas by the **pound** and resist the use of the more "rational" kilogram
- The idea of metrification was born out of the **French Revolution**, as part of the utopian mood: changing the names of winter months to *Nivôse, Pluviôse, Ventôse*; having decimal time, ten-day weeks — the project of changing time has failed, but the metric system was implemented
- The old system has remained **refractory** in the United States and England
- French writer **Edmond About** visited Greece in 1832 and reports how peasants struggled with the metric system as completely unnatural and stuck to **Ottoman standards** instead
- The "modernization" of the Arabic alphabet from the easy-to-memorize old Semitic sequence (ABJAD, HAWWAZ) to the logical sequence A-B-T-TH has created a generation of Arabic speakers **without the ability to recite their alphabet**

### The Logic of Traditional Measurements

- Naturally born weights and measures have a **logic** to them: we use feet, miles, pounds, inches, furlongs, stones because these are remarkably **intuitive** and can be used with minimal expenditure of cognitive effort
- All cultures seem to have similar measurements with some physical correspondence to the everyday: a **meter** does not match anything; a **foot** does — "thirty feet" has meaning; a **mile** (from Latin *milia passum*) is a thousand paces; a **stone** (14 pounds) corresponds to... well, a stone; an **inch** (or *pouce*) corresponds to a thumb; a **furlong** is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath; a **pound** (from *libra*) is what you can imagine holding in your hands
- The *thekel* or *shekel* in Canaanite-Semitic languages means "weight" — something with a physical connotation, similar to the pound; the **digital system** itself comes from the correspondence to the ten fingers

## Chapter 20: Turning Science into Journalism

### Time as a Filter for Information

- We can apply criteria of fragility and robustness to the handling of **information** — the fragile in that context is, like technology, what does not stand the test of time
- The best filtering heuristic consists in taking into account the **age of books and scientific papers**
- Books that are one year old are usually not worth reading (a very low probability of having the qualities for "surviving"), no matter the hype and how "earth-shattering" they may seem
- Taleb follows the **Lindy effect** as a guide in selecting what to read: books that have been around for ten years will be around for ten more; books around for two millennia should be around for quite a bit of time
- Many understand this but do not apply it to **academic work**, which is in much of its modern practice hardly different from journalism (except for the occasional original production)
- Academic work, because of its **attention-seeking orientation**, can be easily subjected to Lindy effects: the hundreds of thousands of papers that are just noise, in spite of how hyped they were at publication

### Scientific Breakthroughs vs. Noise

- The problem in deciding whether a scientific result or a new "innovation" is a breakthrough (the opposite of noise) is that one needs to see **all aspects** of the idea — and there is always some opacity that time, and only time, can dissipate
- Example: the work of **Judah Folkman**, who believed one could cure cancer by choking the blood supply (tumors require nutrition and tend to create new blood vessels, called **neovascularization**) — the idea looked impeccable on paper, but about a decade and a half later, the only significant result was completely outside cancer, in the mitigation of **macular degeneration**
- Likewise, seemingly uninteresting results that go unnoticed can, years later, turn out to be **breakthroughs**
- Time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining to its dustbins all these **overhyped works** — some organizations even turn scientific production into a cheap spectator sport, with ranking of the "ten hottest papers" in sub-sub-specialties

### The Disease of Prizes for the Young

- If we replace scientific results with scientists, we often get the same **neomaniac hype** — there is a disease to grant a prize for a promising scientist "under forty," infecting economics, mathematics, finance, etc.
- Of the fields Taleb is familiar with (literature, finance, economics), he can pretty much ascertain that prizes given to those under forty are the **best reverse indicator of value** — much like the belief (well tested by traders) that companies hyped up as "best" on magazine covers or in books such as *Good to Great* are about to underperform (and one can derive abnormal profit by **shorting their stock**)
- The worst effect of these prizes is **penalizing those who don't get them** and debasing the field by turning it into an athletic competition

### If We Should Have a Prize

- If we should have a prize, it should be for **"over a hundred"**: it took close to one hundred and forty years to validate the contribution of **Jules Regnault**, who discovered optionality and mapped it mathematically — along with what was dubbed the philosopher's stone; his work stayed obscure all this time

### The Textbook Test

- To be convinced of how noisy science can be: take any elementary textbook you read in high school or college with interest — in any discipline — open it to a random chapter, and see if the idea is **still relevant**
- Odds are that it may be boring, but still relevant — or nonboring, and still relevant: it could be the **1215 Magna Carta** (British history), **Caesar's Gallic wars** (Roman history), a historical presentation of **the Stoics** (philosophy), an introduction to **quantum mechanics** (physics), or the **genetic trees of cats and dogs** (biology)
- Now try to get the proceedings of a random conference about the subject matter from **five years ago** — odds are it will feel no different from a five-year-old newspaper, perhaps even less interesting
- Attending breakthrough conferences is, statistically speaking, as much a waste of time as buying a **mediocre lottery ticket** — the odds of the paper being relevant and interesting in five years is no better than one in ten thousand: the **fragility of science!**

### Conversations with Academics vs. Amateurs

- Even the conversation of a **high school teacher** or that of an unsuccessful college professor is likely to be more worthwhile than the latest academic paper, less corrupted with neomania
- Taleb's best conversations in philosophy have been with **French lycée teachers** who love the topic but are not interested in pursuing a career writing papers (in France they teach philosophy in the last year of high school)
- **Amateurs** in any discipline are the best, if you can connect with them — unlike dilettantes, career professionals are to knowledge what prostitutes are to love
- Conversation with an academic is at best like conversation of plumbers, at worst **gossip about uninteresting people** (other academics), small talk
- The conversation of **top scientists** can sometimes be captivating — those people who aggregate knowledge and for whom cruising the subject is effortless as the entire small parts of the field come glued together — but these people are currently too rare on this planet

### Reading Rule: Favor the Old

- One of Taleb's students (majoring in economics) asked for a rule on what to read:

> "As little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books that are not about the last fifty years."

- He blurted out this rule with irritation, hating such questions as "what's the best book you've ever read" or "what are the ten best books" — his "ten best books ever" list changes at the end of every summer
- He had been hyping Daniel Kahneman's recent book, because it is largely an exposition of his research of **thirty-five and forty years ago**, with filtering and modernization
- His recommendation seemed impractical, but after a while the student developed a culture in original texts such as **Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Hayek** — texts he believes he will cite at the age of eighty
- After his detoxification, the student realized that all his peers do is read **timely material that becomes instantly obsolete**

### What Should Break

- In 2010, *The Economist* asked Taleb to imagine the world in 2036 — they wanted a contrarian "balance" to counter the numerous imaginative forecasts
- After a two-hour slow walk, he wrote a series of forecasts and sent them the text — they probably thought at first he was pulling a prank or someone got the wrong email
- Outlining the reasoning on **fragility and asymmetry** (concavity to errors), he explained he would expect the future to be populated with **wall-to-wall bookshelves**, the device called the telephone, artisans, and such — using the notion that most technologies twenty-five years old should be around in another twenty-five years (most, not all)
- The **fragile should disappear or be weakened**: the large, optimized, overreliant on technology, overreliant on the so-called scientific method instead of age-tested heuristics
- Corporations that are large today should be gone, as they have always been weakened by what they think is their strength: **size is the enemy of corporations** as it causes disproportionate fragility to Black Swans
- **City-states and small corporations** are more likely to be around, even thrive
- The **nation-state**, the currency-printing central bank, economics departments may stay nominally but will have their powers severely eroded
- What is in the left column of the Triad should be gone — alas to be replaced by other fragile items

### Prophets and the Present

- By issuing warnings based on **vulnerability** — that is, **subtractive prophecy** — we are closer to the original role of the prophet: to warn, not necessarily to predict, and to predict calamities *if people don't listen*
- The classical role of the prophet, at least in the **Levantine sense**, is not to look into the future but to talk about the present — he tells people what to do, or rather, the more robust what *not* to do
- In Near Eastern **monotheistic traditions** (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), the major role of prophets is the protection of monotheism from idolatrous and pagan enemies that may bring calamities on the straying population
- The prophet is someone in communication with the unique God, or at least can read his mind — and issues warnings to His subjects
- The Semitic *nby*, expressed as **Nevi** or **nebi** (original Hebrew), *nabi'y* (Aramaic), *nabi* (Arabic), is principally someone connecting with God, expressing what is on God's mind
- The meaning of *nab'* in Arabic is "news" (original Semitic root in Acadian, *nabu*, meant "to call")
- The initial Greek translation, **pro-phetes**, meant "spokesman," retained in Islam as a dual role for Mohammed the Prophet as the Messenger (*rasoul*)
- The job of mere **forecasting** is limited to seers or "astrologers" — dismissed by both the Koran and Old Testament
- The prophet deals only with the One God, not with the future like a mere Baalite

### The Persecution of Prophets

- Being a Levantine prophet has not been a particularly desirable professional occupation — acceptance was far from guaranteed
- Jesus mentioned the fate of **Elijah** (who warned against Baal, then ironically had to find solace in Sidon where Baal was worshipped) and announced that *no one becomes a prophet in his own land*
- The prophetic mission was not necessarily voluntary — consider **Jeremiah's** life, laden with *jeremiads* (lamentations), as his unpleasant warnings about destruction and captivity did not make him particularly popular
- Jeremiah was the personification of "shoot the messenger" and the expression **veritas odium parit** — truth brings hatred
- Jeremiah was beaten, punished, persecuted, and the victim of numerous plots involving his own brothers; apocryphal accounts even have him stoned to death in Egypt

### Greek Prophetic Tradition

- Further north of the Semites, in the **Greek tradition**, we find the same focus on messages, warnings about the present, and the same punishment inflicted on those able to understand things others don't
- **Cassandra** gets the gift of prophecy along with the curse of not being believed; when the temple snakes cleaned her ears she could hear some special messages
- **Tiresias** was made blind and transformed into a woman for revealing the secrets of the gods — but as consolation, Athena licked his ears so he could understand secrets in the songs of birds

### Lack of Recursive Thinking

- Recall the inability (from Chapter 2) to learn from past behavior — the problem with **lack of recursion in learning** (lack of second-order thinking)
- If those delivering messages deemed valuable for the long term have been persecuted in past history, one would expect a correcting mechanism — that intelligent people would learn from such historical experience so new messengers would be greeted with understanding — but **nothing of the sort takes place**
- This lack of recursive thinking applies not just to prophecy but to other human activities: if you believe a *new* idea will work and do well, you would expect people to pick up on it without too much reference to the perception of others — but they don't
- Something deemed "original" tends to be modeled on something that was new at the time but is no longer new — so being an Einstein for many scientists means solving a similar problem to the one Einstein solved, which was not a standard problem at all
- The very idea of being an Einstein in physics is **no longer original**
- People in **risk management** only consider risky things that have hurt them in the past (given their focus on "evidence"), not realizing that before these events took place, these occurrences were completely without precedent, escaping standards
- Taleb's personal efforts to make people step outside their shoes to consider these **second-order considerations** have failed — as have his efforts to make them aware of the notion of fragility

### Empedocles' Dog

- In Aristotle's *Magna Moralia*, there is a possibly apocryphal story about **Empedocles**, the pre-Socratic philosopher, who was asked why a dog prefers to always sleep on the same tile
- His answer was that there had to be some **likeness** between the dog and that tile (the story might be doubly apocryphal since we don't know if *Magna Moralia* was actually written by Aristotle himself)
- Consider the match between the dog and the tile: a **natural, biological, explainable or nonexplainable match**, confirmed by long series of recurrent frequentation — in place of rationalism, just consider the history of it
- Human technologies such as writing and reading that have survived are like the tile to the dog — a match between **natural friends**, because they correspond to something deep in our nature
- Every time someone tries to compare a book and an e-reader, or something ancient and a new technology, "opinions" pop up — as if reality cared about opinions and narratives
- There are secrets to our world that only **practice** can reveal, and no opinion or analysis will ever capture in full
- This secret property is revealed through **time**, and thankfully only through time

### What Does Not Make Sense

- If something that makes no sense to you (say, religion if you are an atheist, or some age-old habit or practice called irrational) has been around for a very, very long time, then irrational or not, you can expect it to **stick around much longer** and outlive those who call for its demise

## Chapter 21: Medicine, Convexity, and Opacity

> *What they call nonevidence — Where medicine fragilizes humans, then tries to save them — Newton's law or evidence?*

### Medicine as Dialectic Between Doing and Thinking

- The history of medicine is the story — largely documented — of the **dialectic between doing and thinking** and how to make decisions under opacity
- In the medieval Mediterranean, **Maimonides, Avicenna, Al-Ruhawi**, and the Syriac doctors such as **Hunain Ibn Ishaq** were at once philosophers and doctors
- A doctor in the medieval Semitic world was called **Al-Hakim** ("the wise"), or "practitioner of wisdom," a synonym for philosopher or rabbi (*hkm* is the Semitic root for "wisdom")
- Even in the earlier period there was a crop of Hellenized fellows who stood in the exact middle between medicine and philosophy — the great skeptic philosopher **Sextus Empiricus** was himself a doctor, a member of the skeptical empirical school
- So were **Menodotus of Nicomedia** and the experience-based predecessor of evidence-based medicine

### Via Negativa Decision Rule

- Simple, quite simple **decision rules and heuristics** emerge from this chapter
- **Via negativa** (by removal of the unnatural): only resort to medical techniques when the health payoff is very large (say, saving a life) and visibly exceeds its potential harm, such as incontrovertibly needed surgery or lifesaving medicine (penicillin)
- This is the same as with government intervention — squarely **Thalesian, not Aristotelian** (decision making based on payoffs, not knowledge)
- In these cases medicine has **positive asymmetries** — convexity effects — and the outcome will be less likely to produce fragility
- Otherwise, in situations where benefits of a particular medicine, procedure, or nutritional or lifestyle modification appear small — say, those aiming for comfort — we have a large potential **sucker problem** (on the wrong side of convexity effects)

### The Link Between Nonlinearity and Fragility in Medicine

- One of the unintended side benefits of the theorems Taleb and **Raphael Douady** developed in their paper mapping risk detection techniques (in Chapter 19) is an exact link between (a) **nonlinearity in exposure or dose-response** and (b) potential **fragility or antifragility**

### What Should Be Considered Evidence

- Taleb extends the problem to epistemological grounds and makes rules for *what should be considered evidence*: as with whether a cup should be considered half-empty or half-full, there are situations where we focus on **absence of evidence** and others where we focus on **evidence**
- In some cases one can be **confirmatory**, not others — it depends on the risks
- Take **smoking**: at some stage viewed as bringing small gains in pleasure and even health (people truly thought it was a good thing) — it took decades for its harm to become visible
- Had someone questioned it, they would have faced the canned-naive-academized response: **"do you have evidence that this is harmful?"** (the same type of response as "is there evidence that polluting is harmful?")
- The solution is simple, an extension of *via negativa* and Fat Tony's **don't-be-a-sucker rule**: the non-natural needs to prove its benefits, not the natural
- According to the statistical principle that nature is to be considered much less of a sucker than humans, in a complex domain, only **time — a long time — is evidence**

### The "Do You Have Evidence" Fallacy

- The **"do you have evidence" fallacy**: mistaking evidence of no harm for no evidence of harm, is similar to misinterpreting NED (no evidence of disease) for evidence of no disease
- This is the same error as mistaking **absence of evidence for evidence of absence** — one that tends to affect smart and educated people, as if education made people more confirmatory in their responses and more liable to fall into simple logical errors
- Under **nonlinearities**, the simple statements "harmful" or "beneficial" break down: **it is all in the dosage**

### How to Argue in an Emergency Room

- Taleb once broke his nose walking — for the sake of antifragility, walking on uneven surfaces as part of his antifragility program under the influence of **Loic Le Corre**, who believes in naturalistic exercise
- He felt the world was richer, more fractal, and contrasted this terrain with the smooth surfaces of sidewalks and corporate offices that felt like prisons
- In the emergency room, the doctor and staff insisted he should apply **"ice"** (ice-cold patch) to his nose — in the middle of the pain, it hit him that the swelling was most certainly not directly caused by the trauma but was his own **body's response to the injury**
- It seemed to him an insult to Mother Nature to override her programmed reactions unless we had good reason backed by proper empirical testing to show humans can do better — **the burden of evidence falls on us humans**
- He mumbled to the emergency room doctor whether he had any **statistical evidence** of benefits from applying ice to his nose or if it resulted from a naive version of *interventionism*
- The doctor's response: **"You have a nose the size of Cleveland and you are now interested in … numbers?"** — he had no answer
- Upon checking via computer, Taleb confirmed there is **no compelling empirical evidence** in favor of reduction of swelling (outside of very rare cases where swelling would threaten the patient)
- It was pure **sucker-rationalism** in the mind of doctors, coupled with interventionism — this need to *do something*, this defect of thinking and denigration of the unobserved
- This defect is not limited to swelling: this **confabulation plagues the entire history of medicine**
- Researchers **Paul Meehl and Robin Dawes** pioneered a tradition cataloging the tension between "clinical" and "actuarial" (statistical) knowledge, examining how many things believed true by professionals and clinicians aren't so and don't match empirical evidence
- The problem: these researchers did not have a clear idea of where the **burden of empirical evidence** lies (the difference between naive or pseudo empiricism and rigorous empiricism)
- The onus is on the doctors to show us why reducing fever is good, why eating breakfast before engaging in activity is healthy (there is no evidence), or why bleeding patients is the best alternative (they've stopped doing so)
- Sometimes the answer they give when they have no clue is: **"I am a doctor"** or **"are you a doctor?"**
- Taleb sometimes gets letters of support from alternative medicine fellows, which makes him go postal: the approach in this book is **ultra-orthodox, ultra-rigorous, and ultra-scientific**, certainly not in favor of alternative medicine

### Diseases of Civilization and Hidden Costs

- The **hidden costs of health care** are largely in the denial of antifragility
- It may not be just medicine — what we call **diseases of civilization** result from the attempt by humans to make life comfortable for ourselves against our own interest, since the comfortable is what fragilizes
- The rest of this chapter focuses on specific medical cases with hidden **negative convexity effects** (small gains, large losses) — and reframes the ideas of iatrogenics in connection with fragility and nonlinearities

### First Principle of Iatrogenics (Empiricism)

- The first principle of iatrogenics: we do not need **evidence of harm** to claim that a drug or an unnatural *via positiva* procedure is dangerous
- Recall the **turkey problem**: harm is in the future, not in the narrowly defined past — in other words, empiricism is not naive empiricism
- **Trans fat**: humans discovered how to make fat products; during the era of scientism they were convinced they could make it *better* than nature — not just equal, better
- Chemists assumed they could produce a fat replacement superior to lard or butter: synthetic products such as **margarine** stay soft in the refrigerator (more convenient), synthetic fats were derived from vegetables (more economical), and trans fat was assumed to be healthier
- Trans fat use was propagated very widely, and after a few hundred million years of consumption of animal fat, people suddenly got scared of "**saturated fat**" mainly from shoddy statistical interpretations
- Today trans fat is **widely banned** as it turned out it is behind heart disease and cardiovascular problems
- **Thalidomide**: a drug meant to reduce nausea episodes of pregnant women — it led to **birth defects**
- **Diethylstilbestrol**: another drug that silently harmed the fetus and led to delayed **gynecological cancer** among daughters
- These two mistakes are telling because in both cases the benefits appeared to be **obvious and immediate, though small**, and the harm remained delayed for years — at least three-quarters of a generation

### Second Principle of Iatrogenics (Nonlinearity in Response)

- Second principle: iatrogenics is **not linear** — we should not take risks with near-healthy people but should take a lot, a lot more risks with those deemed in danger
- **Hypertension example**: when hypertension is mild ("normotensive"), the chance of benefiting from a certain drug is close to **5.6 percent** (only one person in eighteen benefits from treatment); when blood pressure is "high" or "severe," the chances of benefiting are **26 and 72 percent** respectively
- Treatment benefits are **convex to condition** — benefits rise disproportionally in an accelerated manner
- Iatrogenics should be constant for all categories — in the very ill condition, benefits are large relative to iatrogenics; in the borderline one, they are small
- We need to focus on **high-symptom conditions** and really ignore others where the patient is not very ill
- The argument is based on the structure of **conditional survival probabilities** — Mother Nature had to have tinkered through selection in inverse proportion to the rarity of the condition
- Of the hundred and twenty thousand drugs available today, one can hardly find a *via positiva* one that makes a healthy person unconditionally "better" — and if someone shows one, Taleb will be skeptical of yet-unseen side effects
- In a "mature" market there is **no free lunch** anymore; what appears as a free lunch has a hidden risk — in trading this was called a **"sucker's trade"**
- The more ill the person, the less likely nature would have found the solution by itself, in an **accelerating way** — a condition three units of deviation from the norm is more than three hundred times rarer than normal; five units of deviation is more than a million times rarer
- The medical community has **not modeled such nonlinearity** of benefits to iatrogenics — there is little explicit use of convexity biases in decision-making methodology
- Even risks seem to be **linearly extrapolated**, causing both underestimation and overestimation — a paper on radiation: "The standard model currently in use applies a linear scale, extrapolating cancer risk from high doses to low doses of ionizing radiation"
- **Pharmaceutical companies** are under financial pressure to find diseases and satisfy security analysts — scraping the bottom of the barrel, looking for disease among healthier and healthier people, lobbying for reclassifications of conditions, and fine-tuning sales tricks to get doctors to overprescribe
- Blood pressure in the upper range of "normal" is now reclassified as **"pre-hypertensive"** even with no symptoms — nothing wrong if it leads to healthier lifestyle and robust *via negativa* measures, but what's behind such classification is often a drive for more medication
- Taleb is not against pharma's function and mission but rather its business practice: they should focus *for their own benefit* on **extreme diseases**, not on reclassifications or pressuring doctors to prescribe
- The iatrogenics is in the patient, not in the treatment: if the patient is close to death, all speculative treatments should be encouraged — **no holds barred**; if the patient is near healthy, then **Mother Nature should be the doctor**

### Jensen's Inequality in Medicine

- The philosopher's stone: the **volatility of an exposure** can matter more than its average — the difference is the **"convexity bias"**
- If you are antifragile (convex) to a given substance, then you are better off having it **randomly distributed** rather than provided steadily
- Very few medical papers make use of nonlinearity by applying **convexity effects** to medical problems, in spite of the ubiquity of nonlinear responses in biology
- Taleb actually found only one explicit use of **Jensen's inequality** in one single application — thanks to his friend **Eric Briys** — and only one that used it properly
- The response "we know that" by medical researchers when the consequence of nonlinearity is explained to them is rather lame
- Convexity effects work in an identical way with **options, innovations**, anything convex — now applied to lungs
- People with lung diseases, including **acute respiratory distress syndrome**, used to be put on mechanical ventilators with constant pressure and volume — steadiness seemed a good idea
- But the reaction of the patient is **nonlinear to pressure** (convex over an initial range, then concave above it) and suffers from such regularity
- **J. F. Brewster** and associates figured out that dispensing higher pressure on occasion and low pressure at other times allowed them to provide a lot more volume to the lungs for a given mean pressure, thus **decreasing patient mortality**
- An additional benefit: an occasional spike in pressure helps to open up **collapsed alveoli** — that's how our lungs function when healthy, with variations and "noise" rather than steady airflow
- Humans are **antifragile to lung pressure** — this arises directly from the nonlinearity of the response since everything convex is antifragile up to a certain dosage
- People who deal with **nutrition** have not examined the difference between random calories and steady nutrition — something to return to in the next chapter
- Not using models of nonlinear effects such as convexity biases while "doing empirical work" is like having to catalog every apple falling from a tree and call the operation "empiricism" instead of just using **Newton's equation**

### Burying the Evidence

- What made medicine mislead people for so long is that its **successes were prominently displayed** and its mistakes literally buried — just like so many other interesting stories in the cemetery of history
- An illustration of intervention bias with **negative convexity effects**: in the 1940s and 1950s many children and teenagers received **radiation** for acne, thymus gland enlargement, tonsillitis, to remove birthmarks and treat ringworm of the scalp
- In addition to goiters and other late complications, approximately **7 percent** of patients who received this radiation developed thyroid cancer two to four decades later
- We should not write off radiation entirely — we are necessarily **antifragile to some dose of radiation** at naturally found levels; small doses may prevent injuries and cancers from larger ones, as the body develops some kind of immunity
- After hundreds of millions of years of having skin exposed to sun rays, we suddenly need so much protection from them — is it that our exposure is more harmful because of changes in the atmosphere, or populations mismatching the pigmentation of their skin to their environment, or that makers of **sun protection products** need to make profits?

### The Never-ending History of Turkey Situations

- The list of attempts to outsmart nature driven by **naive rationalism** is long — always meant to "improve" things, with continuous first-order learning (banning the offending drug or procedure but not figuring out that we could be making the mistake again elsewhere)
- **Statins**: meant to lower cholesterol; there is an asymmetry — one needs to treat **fifty high risk persons for five years** to avoid a single cardiovascular event; statins can potentially harm people who are not very sick, for whom the benefits are either minimal or totally nonexistent
- We will not be able to get an evidence-based picture of the **hidden harm** in the short term (remember smoking); arguments made in favor of routine administration of these drugs often lie in a few **statistical illusions or even manipulation**
- Drug companies seem to play on nonlinearities and **bundle the very ill and the less ill**, in addition to assuming that the metric "cholesterol" equates 100 percent with health
- Statins fail in applying the **first principle of iatrogenics** (unseen harm); further, they certainly *do* lower cholesterol, but your objective function as a human is not to lower a certain metric to pass a school-like test but to get in **better health**
- It is not certain whether these indicators people try to lower are **causes or manifestations** that correlate to a condition — just as muzzling a baby would prevent him from crying but would not remove the cause of his emotions
- **Metric-lowering drugs** are particularly vicious because of legal complexity: the doctor has the incentive to prescribe because should the patient have a heart attack, he would be sued for negligence; but the error in the opposite direction is not penalized at all, as side effects do not appear at all as being caused by medicine
- The same problem of **naive interpretation mixed with intervention bias** applies to cancer detection: there is a marked bias in favor of treatment, even when it brings more harm, because the legal system favors intervention
- **Surgery**: historians show that surgery had a much better track record than medicine for a long time — it was checked by the necessary rigor of visible results
- When operating on victims of very severe trauma (extracting a bullet, pushing bowels back in place), the iatrogenics is reduced; the downside of the operation is small compared to the benefits — hence **positive convexity effects**
- Unlike with usual pharmaceutical interventions, it is hard to say that Mother Nature would have done a better job — surgeons used to be **blue-collar workers**, or closer to artisans than high science, so they did not feel too obligated to theorize
- The two professions of medical doctor and surgeon were kept professionally and socially separate: one was an **ars** (craft built around experience-driven heuristics), the other **scientia** (reposed on theories, a general theory of humans)
- Surgeons were there for emergencies — in England, France, and some Italian cities, surgeons' guilds were merged with those of **barbers**
- The Soviet-Harvardification of surgery was for a long time constrained by the **visibility of the results** — you can't fool the eye
- Today's surgery, thanks to **anesthesia**, is done with a much smaller hurdle — surgeons now need to attend medical school (albeit a less theoretical one than the Sorbonne or Bologna of the Middle Ages)
- By contrast, in the past, **phlebotomy** (bloodletting) was one of the few operations performed by surgeons without any disincentive
- **Back surgery** done in modern times to correct sciatica is often useless, minus the possible harm from the operation — evidence shows that six years later, such an operation is on average equivalent to doing nothing, yet every operation brings risks (brain damage from anesthesia, medical error, exposure to hospital germs)
- Yet **spinal cord surgery** such as lumbar disc fusion is still practiced liberally, particularly as it is very lucrative for the doctor
- **Antibiotics**: every time you take an antibiotic, you help to some degree the mutation of germs into **antibiotic-resistant strains**; add to that the toying with your immune system — you transfer the antifragility from your body to the germ; the solution is to do it only when the benefits are large
- **Hygiene** (or excessive hygiene) has the same effect, particularly when people clean their hands with chemicals after every social exposure

### Verified and Potential Examples of Iatrogenics

- A list of verified and potential examples of iatrogenics (in terms of larger downside outside of very ill patients, whether such downside has been verified or not):
  - **Vioxx**: anti-inflammatory medicine with delayed heart problems
  - **Antidepressants** (used beyond the necessary cases)
  - **Bariatric surgery** (in place of starvation of overweight diabetic patients)
  - **Cortisone**
  - **Disinfectants/cleaning products** potentially giving rise to autoimmune diseases
  - **Hormone replacement therapy**
  - **Hysterectomies**
  - **Cesarean births** beyond the strictly necessary
  - **Ear tubes** in babies as an immediate response to ear infection
  - **Lobotomies**
  - **Iron supplementation**
  - **Whitening of rice and wheat** (once considered progress)
  - **Sunscreen creams** suspected to cause harm
  - **Hygiene** beyond a certain point (may make you fragile by denying **hormesis** — our own antifragility)
  - **Probiotics** (we ingest them because we don't "eat enough dirt" anymore)
  - **Lysol and other disinfectants** killing so many "germs" that kids' developing immune systems are robbed of necessary workout (or robbed of the "good" friendly germs and parasites)
  - **Dental** treatments

## Chapter 22: To Live Long, but Not Too Long

### Life Expectancy and Convexity
- Questioning medicine's "progress" prompts the sophistry that "we tend to live longer" — but this is the **exact same argument** as saying eating fresh food implies rejecting civilization, the rule of law, and humanism
- Life expectancy increased due to **sanitation, penicillin, drop in crime, life-saving surgery** — not routine medical treatment
- If we live longer because of medicine, it is thanks to **severe, lethal cases** (the convex cases) — not mild ailments where iatrogenics dominate
- **Hospital strikes** reveal that when only urgent cases are treated, life expectancy either increases or does not drop — a devastating indictment of routine medical intervention
- Many of the gains attributed to medicine are actually from **improvements in living conditions and social mores**

### Subtraction Adds to Your Life
- The **via negativa** approach to health: what you **don't do** matters more than what you do
- Remove **painkillers** (they mask root causes like sleep deprivation, tension, bad stressors), **vitamin pills**, **food supplements**, the family doctor, headache medicine
- **Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.**: "if all the medications were dumped in the sea, it would be better for mankind but worse for the fishes"
- Taleb's father, an oncologist, raised him under the maxim that medications should be dumped in the sea — and followed it in practice
- Avoid fruits without ancient Greek or Hebrew names (mangoes, papayas, oranges are postmedieval candy equivalents)
- **Personal rule on liquids**: drink nothing that isn't at least a thousand years old — wine, water, coffee. No soft drinks. Orange juice is the most deceitfully noxious "healthy" drink
- What is called "healthy" is generally unhealthy, just as "social" networks are antisocial and the "knowledge" economy is typically ignorant
- Removing offensive irritants from life (morning newspapers, Thomas Friedman, Paul Krugman, the commute, air conditioning, television, gym "strength training" machines) produced a considerable jump in personal health

### The Iatrogenics of Money
- Construction laborers with ham and cheese baguettes seem **happier** than billionaires at Michelin restaurants — food tastes better after exertion
- Romans saw anything that "softens" or "mollifies" negatively — history likes the lurid; they understood comfort's side effects
- **Desert vs. city culture**: the desert is full of poetry, contemplation, frugality; the city breeds gossip, moral decay, decadence
- Christ fasted forty days in the Judean desert; Saint Simeon spent forty years on a column in Northern Syria — the tradition of shedding possessions
- Medical iatrogenics is the result of **wealth and sophistication**, not poverty — money has its own iatrogenics
- **The treadmill effect**: you need to make more and more to stay in the same place — greed is antifragile, though not its victims
- Wealth does not make people more independent — **we have never been richer in history, and never more in debt** (for the ancients, someone in debt was in bondage)
- **Tantalus class**: permanently tantalized, socialized into a certain milieu, exposed to a treadmill — you move to Greenwich, Connecticut, then become a pauper next to twenty-million-dollar mansions
- Romans circumvented treadmill effects through **patron-client relationships** — private charity, no welfare, no church
- Provincial landowners maintained "open house" with open tables — court life leads to corruption

### Religion and Naive Interventionism
- Religion has **invisible purposes** beyond what literal-minded scientistic-scientifiers identify — one purpose is to **protect us from scientism**
- For marginal disease, **anything that takes you away from the doctor and allows you to do nothing** will be beneficial — going to church (or the temple of Apollo) for mild cases helps
- The risk of iatrogenics exceeds the benefit of cure in cases with **negative convexity** — religion helps by limiting intervention
- Human nature "deep down, knows when to resort to the solace of religion, and when to switch to science"

### If It's Wednesday, I Must Be Vegan

- Taleb describes conference organizers asking about his dietary requirements — his answer depends on the day of the week because he follows the **Greek Orthodox calendar** and its required fasts
- This confuses the "Paleo camp" vs. "vegan camp" categorizers — the "Paleo" people try to replicate supposed ancestral high-meat, high-animal-fat diets; vegans eat no animal product at all
- It is a **naive rationalistic mistake** to be in either category permanently (except for religious or spiritual reasons) — episodic variation is the key
- Religion's heuristics accommodate rules while allowing occasional cheating — among other things, religion's role is to **tame the iatrogenics of abundance**: fasting makes you lose your sense of entitlement

### Convexity Effects and Random Nutrition

- **Jensen's inequality** applied to nutrition: irregularity has its benefits in some areas; regularity has its detriments — where Jensen's inequality applies, irregularity might be medicine
- What we mostly need to do is **remove a few meals at random**, or at least avoid steadiness in food consumption
- The error of missing **nonlinearities** is found in two places: in the mixture and in the frequency of food intake
- Humans are said to be **omnivorous** compared to specialized mammals like cows (salad-eaters) and lions (prey-eaters) — the ability to be omnivorous came in response to more variegated environments with unplanned, haphazard serial availability of sources
- **Specialization** is the response to a very stable habitat free of abrupt changes; **diversification of function** had to come in response to variety
- **Herbivores** are subjected to much less randomness than lions in food intake — they eat steadily but must work extremely hard to metabolize all nutrients, spending several hours a day eating
- The **lion** relies on more luck; it succeeds in a small percentage of kills (less than 20%), but when it eats, it gets all nutrients produced by the prey's hard work
- Principle derived from the random structure of the environment: **when we are herbivores, we eat steadily; when we are predators, we eat more randomly** — hence proteins need to be consumed randomly for statistical reasons
- If you agree that we need "balanced" nutrition of a certain combination, it is wrong to assume we need such balance **at every meal** rather than **serially** — there is a big difference between getting all nutrients together at every meal versus having them separately, serially
- **Deprivation is a stressor** — and we know what stressors do when allowed adequate recovery; **convexity effects** at work: getting three times the daily dose of protein in one day and nothing the next two is certainly not biologically equivalent to "steady" moderate consumption if our metabolic reactions are nonlinear
- Taleb is convinced (an inevitable result of nonlinearity) that **we are antifragile to randomness in food delivery and composition** — at least over a certain range, or number of days

### The Cretan/Mediterranean Diet Fallacy

- One blatant denial of **convexity bias** is the theory about the Cretan (or Mediterranean) diet that triggered a change in eating habits of the U.S. enlightened class, away from steak and potatoes in favor of grilled fish with salad and feta cheese
- What happened: someone looked at the **longevity of Cretans**, cataloged what they ate, then inferred naively that they lived longer because of the types of food consumed
- It could be true, but the **second-order effect** (the variations in intake) could be dominant — something that went unnoticed by mechanistic researchers
- The **Greek Orthodox church** has, depending on the severity of the local culture, almost **two hundred days of fasting per year** — and these are harrowing fasts
- Taleb describes writing during **Orthodox Lent**, a forty-day period in which almost no animal product can be consumed, no sweets, and for some sticklers, no olive oil
- He describes "ruse" foods from his ancestral village of **Amioun** in the Koura valley of Northern Lebanon — Levantine kibbeh made with herbs and beans instead of meat, meatballs made of matzoh-style small brown balls in a lentil soup
- The compensation for absent nutrients from daily diet will **take place in lumps** — deprivation of protein with fish on allowed days, then ravenously eating lamb on Easter Day, then consuming disproportionally high quantities of fatty red meat thereafter
- **Antifragility to the stressor of the fast**: it makes food taste better and can produce euphoria in one's system

> Breaking a fast feels like the exact opposite of a hangover.

### How to Eat Yourself

- People accept that the stressors of **exercise** are good for you, but do not transfer this to the point that **food deprivation** can have the same effect
- Scientists are in the process of discovering the effects of **episodic deprivation** of some, or all, foods — evidence shows we get sharper and fitter in response to the stress of the constraint
- Biological studies verify the existence of a human response to hunger: **biological mechanisms are activated by food deprivation**
- Experiments on cohorts show the positive effect of hunger — or deprivation of a food group — on the human body
- Researchers rationalize with the mechanism of **autophagy** (eating oneself): when deprived of external sources, cells start eating themselves, or breaking down proteins and recombining amino acids to provide material for building other cells
- It is assumed by some researchers that the **"vacuum cleaner" effect of autophagy** is the key to longevity — though Taleb notes his ideas are natural and impervious to their theories: occasional starvation produces some health benefits and that's that
- The response to hunger, our **antifragility**, has been underestimated — we've been telling people to eat a good meal for breakfast so they can face the day's travails, but this is not a new theory by empirically blind modern-day nutritionists
- In Stendhal's *Le rouge et le noir*, protagonist Julien Sorel is told "the work for the day will be long and rough, so let us **fortify** ourselves with a breakfast" (in the French of the period, breakfast was called "the first lunch")
- The idea of **breakfast as a main meal** with cereals and other such materials has been progressively shown to be harming humans — tests show that no benefits are derived from breakfast unless one has worked for it beforehand
- We are **not designed to be receiving food from the delivery person** — in nature, we had to expend energy to eat; lions hunt to eat, they don't eat their meal then hunt for pleasure; giving people food before they expend energy would confuse their signaling process
- Ample evidence that **intermittent food deprivation** has been shown to engender many beneficial effects on many functions
- **Valter Longo** noted that prisoners in concentration camps got less sick in the first phase of food restriction, then broke down later; he tried the result experimentally and found that mice, in the initial phases of starvation, can withstand high doses of chemotherapy without visible side effects
- Scientists use the narrative that starvation causes the expression of a gene coding a protein called **SIRT, SIRT1, or sirtuin**, which brings longevity and other effects
- The **antifragility of humans** manifests itself in the response with up-regulation of some genes in response to hunger

### Dose Response in Biology

- Religions with **ritual fasts** have more answers than assumed by those who look at them too literally — what these ritual fasts do is try to bring **nonlinearities in consumption** to match biological properties
- The Appendix shows graphically the standard **dose responses** in biology: a little bit of anything seems to harbor positive convexity effects (whether beneficial or harmful); add to it and the effect weakens
- Clearly at the upper end, the dose has **no additional effect** since one reaches saturation

### Walk-Deprived

- Another source of harm from **naive rationalism**: just as people tried to shorten their sleep for a long time, many people think that walking is useless, so they use mechanical transportation and get exercise at the gym
- When they walk, they do "power walks" sometimes with weights on their arms — they do not realize that **walking effortlessly, at a pace below the stress level**, can have some benefits
- Walking may be as necessary for humans as sleep — perhaps **as necessary as sleep**, which modernity at some point tried to reduce
- Since all ancestors until the advent of the automobile spent much of their time walking around (and sleeping), Taleb tries to just follow the logic, even before some medical journal catches up to the idea and produces what referees of medical journals call "evidence"

### I Want to Live Forever

- All people hear about is how to **live longer, richer**, and laden with electronic gadgets — we are not the first generation to believe the worst possible thing to befall us is death
- For the ancients, the worst possible outcome was not death, but **a dishonorable death**, or even just a regular one — for a classical hero, dying in a retirement home with tubes would not be the attractive *telos* for a life
- The modern illusion that we should **live as long as we can** — as if each individual were the end product — this idea of the "me" as a unit can be traced to the Enlightenment, and with it, **fragility**
- Before that, we were part of the present **collective and future progeny** — both present and future tribes exploited the fragility of individuals to strengthen themselves
- People engaged in **sacrifices, sought martyrdom**, died for the group, and derived pride from doing so; they worked hard for future generations
- Sadly, the modern economic system is loading future generations with **public governmental debt**, causing depletion of resources, and environmental blight to satisfy the requirements of the security analysts and the banking establishment — we cannot separate fragility from ethics
- The **gene is antifragile** since it is information, but the carrier of the gene is fragile, and needs to be so for the gene to get stronger — we live to produce information, or improve on it
- Nietzsche had the Latin pun *aut liberi, aut libri* — **either children or books**, both information that carries through the centuries
- Taleb was reading John Gray's *The Immortalization Commission* about attempts to use science in a postreligious world to achieve immortality — he felt deep disgust at the efforts of **"singularity" thinkers** (such as Ray Kurzweil) who believe in humans' potential to live forever
- If Taleb had to find the **anti-me**, the person with diametrically opposite ideas and lifestyle, it would be Ray Kurzweil — it is not just neomania; while Taleb proposes removing offensive elements from people's diets, Kurzweil works by adding, **popping close to two hundred pills daily**
- The **antifragility of a system** comes from the mortality of its components — Taleb sees himself as part of the larger population called humans; his purpose is to die a heroic death for the sake of the collective, to produce offspring, or eventually books — his genes, the antifragile in him, should be the ones seeking immortality, not him

> Then say goodbye, have a nice funeral in St. Sergius (Mar Sarkis) in Amioun, and, as the French say, *place aux autres*—make room for others.

### Footnotes on Chapter 22

- **Conditional life expectancy** numbers are revealing: Richard Lewontin estimates that in the last 50 years, only four months have been added to the expected life span of a person who is already 60 years old; CDC data shows life expectancy at age 20 only increased from 42.79 additional years in 1900–1902 to 51.2 in 1949–1951 and to 58.2 in 2002
- The **Cretan diet fallacy**: the second-order effect (the variations in intake via fasting) could be the dominant factor, not the specific foods consumed
- **Burden of evidence** on avoiding harm: a doctor who stopped eating sugar because of its potential harm was apologetic for doing so "without full evidence" — but the best test of empirical wisdom is in where one puts the burden of evidence
- Both sides of the fat vs. carbohydrates debate **ignore the nonlinearities** from sequence and composition — few realize we need to randomize protein intake
- The **principal disease of abundance**: habituation and jadedness (what biologists call dulling of receptors)

> Seneca: "To a sick person, honey tastes better."

## Book VII: The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility

- Now, **ethics** — under opacity and in the newfound complexity of the world, people can hide risks and hurt others, with the law incapable of catching them
- **Iatrogenics** has both delayed and invisible consequences — it is hard to see causal links, to fully understand what's going on
- Under such epistemic limitations, **skin in the game** is the only true mitigator of fragility
- **Hammurabi's code** provided a simple solution close to thirty-seven hundred years ago — this solution has been increasingly abandoned in modern times, as we have developed a fondness for neomanic complication over archaic simplicity

---

## Chapter 23: Skin in the Game: Antifragility and Optionality at the Expense of Others

> *Making talk less cheap—Looking at the spoils—Corporations with random acts of pity?—Predict and inverse predict*

- This chapter examines what happens when **someone gets the upside, and a different person gets the downside**
- The worst problem of modernity lies in the **malignant transfer of fragility and antifragility** from one party to the other — one getting the benefits, the other (unwittingly) getting the harm, facilitated by the growing wedge between the ethical and the legal
- This is an **agency problem** — and the agency problem is, of course, an **asymmetry**

### The Disappearance of Heroism

- We are witnessing a fundamental change — consider older societies that have survived; the main difference between them and us is the **disappearance of a sense of heroism**: a shift away from respect and power to those who take downside risks for others
- **Heroism** is the exact inverse of the agency problem: someone elects to bear the disadvantage (risks his own life, or harm to himself, or accepts deprivation) for the sake of others
- What we have currently is the opposite: **power goes to bankers, corporate executives (nonentrepreneurs), and politicians**, who steal a free option from society
- Example of an inverse agency problem: the story of a **nanny who died to save a child** from being hit by a car — accepting death in someone else's place
- The word **"sacrifice"** is related to *sacred*, the domain of the holy that is separate from the profane

### Traditional Societies and the Value of Courage

- In traditional societies, a person is only as respectable as the **downside he or she is willing to face** for the sake of others
- The most courageous or valorous occupy the highest rank: **knights, generals, commanders** — even mafia dons accept that such rank makes them the most exposed
- The same applies to **saints**, who devote their lives to serve others — to help the weak, the deprived, and the dispossessed

### Table 7: Ethics and the Foundational Asymmetry (The Triad)

- **No Skin in the Game** (keeps upside, transfers downside to others, owns a hidden option at someone else's expense): Bureaucrats, Cheap talk ("tawk" in Fat Tony's lingo), Consultants/sophists, Businesses, Corporate executives (with suit), Theoreticians/data miners/observational studies, Centralized government, Editors, Journalists who "analyze" and predict, Politicians, Bankers, Fragilista Prof. Dr. Joseph Stiglitz, Risk vendors
- **Skin in the Game** (keeps his own downside, takes his own risk): Citizens, Actions (no tawk), Merchants/businessmen, Artisans, Entrepreneurs, Laboratory and field experimenters, Government of city-states, Writers, Speculators, Activists, Traders, Fat Tony
- **Skin in the Game for the Sake of Others, or Soul in the Game** (takes the downside on behalf of others, or universal values): Saints/knights/warriors/soldiers, Expensive talk, Prophets/philosophers (in the pre-modern sense), Artists/some artisans, Entrepreneurs/Innovators, Maverick scientists, Municipal government, Great writers, Journalists who take risks and *expose* frauds, Rebels/dissidents/revolutionaries, Nero Tulip, Taxpayers (not quite voluntarily soul in the game, but they are victims)

### Courage and Its Evolution

- The **robustness — even antifragility — of society** depends on heroes and people of courage; if we are here today, it is because someone, at some stage, took some risks for us
- Courage and heroism do not mean **blind risk taking** — it is not necessarily recklessness; there is a pseudocourage that comes from risk blindness, where people underestimate the odds of failure
- For the Stoics, **prudence is connatural to courage** — Publilius Syrus: prudence was deemed the courage of the general
- **Heroism has evolved** through civilization from the martial arena to that of ideas:
  - In **preclassical times**, the Homeric hero was principally endowed with physical courage
  - In **later classical times**, for the great Lacedaemonian king Agiselaus, a truly happy life was one crowned by the privilege of death in battle; courage had evolved from purely martial prowess into something greater — acts of **renunciation** and sacrifice for the collective
  - Finally, the **Socratic Plato** form of courage was born: the courage to stand up for an idea, and enjoy death in a state of thrill — the privilege of dying for truth or standing up for one's values had become the highest form of honor
- No one has had more prestige in history than **two thinkers who overtly and defiantly sacrificed their lives for their ideas** — two Eastern Mediterraneans; one Greek and one Semite

### Happiness and Middle Class Values

- We should pause when we hear **happiness** defined as an economic or materialistic condition
- Taleb is distraught by the glorified heroism-free **"middle class values"** that have spread via globalization: enshrining "hard work" for a bank or tobacco company, diligent newspaper reading, obedience, dependence on the opinion of a boss, reliance on stock market investments, tropical vacations, and a suburban life
- If success is random, a conscious act of **heroism is nonrandom** — the "ethical" middle class may work for a tobacco company and through casuistry call themselves ethical

### Half-Men and the Price of Dignity

- A **half-man** is not someone who does not have an opinion, just someone who does not take risks for it
- Historian **Paul Veyne** has shown that it is a big myth that gladiators were forced labor — most were volunteers who wanted the chance to become heroes by risking their lives
- Taleb's greatest lesson in courage came from his **father**: he had a large ego and demanded respect; when insulted by a militiaman at a road check during the Lebanese war, he refused to comply; as he drove away, the gunman shot him in the back; the bullet stayed in his chest for the rest of his life
- Dignity is worth **nothing unless you earn it**, unless you are willing to pay a price for it
- The notion of **megalopsychon** (a term expressed in Aristotle's ethics): a sense of grandeur that was superseded by the Christian value of "humility"; in Arabic it is called *Shhm* — best translated as **nonsmall**
- If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don't take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand

### Hammurabi

- We cannot separate **fragility and ethics** — just as only business school professors and similar fragilistas separate robustness and growth
- Some people have **options, or have optionality**, at the expense of others — and the others don't know it
- The effects of **transfers of fragility** are becoming more acute, as modernity builds up more people on the left column (inverse heroes): tenured government employees, academic researchers, journalists, the medical establishment, Big Pharma, and many more
- **Hammurabi's code** — now about 3,800 years old — identifies the need to reestablish a **symmetry of fragility**:

> If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house—the builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of the son of the owner of the house, a son of that builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of a slave of the owner of the house—he shall give to the owner of the house a slave of equal value.

- They were **much more advanced 3,800 years ago** than we are today — the builder knows more about what lies hidden in the foundations than any safety inspector, making it the best risk management rule ever
- The foundation, with **delayed collapse**, is the best place to hide risk — Hammurabi and his advisors understood small probabilities
- The object is not to punish retrospectively, but to **save lives by providing up-front disincentive** in case of harm to others during the fulfillment of one's profession
- These asymmetries are particularly severe when it comes to **small-probability extreme events** (Black Swans) — as these are the most misunderstood and their exposure is easiest to hide

### Fat Tony's Two Heuristics

- First: **never get on a plane if the pilot is not on board**
- Second: **make sure there is also a copilot**
- The first heuristic addresses the asymmetry in rewards and punishment, or **transfer of fragility** between individuals
- **Ralph Nader's** rule: people voting for war need to have at least one descendant (child or grandchild) exposed to combat
- For the **Romans**, engineers needed to spend some time under the bridge they built — something that should be required of financial engineers today; the English went further and had the families of the engineers spend time with them under the bridge after it was built
- Every **opinion maker** needs to have "skin in the game" in the event of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion — anyone producing a forecast or making an economic analysis needs to have something to lose from it
- **Forecasts induce risk taking** — they are more toxic than any other form of human pollution
- The second heuristic: we need to build **redundancy**, a margin of safety, avoiding optimization, mitigating (even removing) asymmetries in our sensitivity to risk

### The Talker's Free Option

- Society currently does the opposite of what it should: granting **mere talkers a free option** — we need to put entrepreneurs and risk takers at the top of the pyramid, and academizing academics, talkers, and political politicians at the bottom
- Fat Tony milking suckers when they ran to the exit door seemed at first inelegant to Nero — benefiting from the misfortune of others is not the most graceful approach to life
- But Tony had **something at risk** and would have been personally harmed by an adverse outcome — Fat Tony had no agency problem; this makes it permissible
- There is an even worse problem: people who just **talk, prognosticate, theorize** — no opinion without risk; no risk without hope for return

> If you have an opinion, you got to do so if you have an opinion. Otherwise, you do not really have an opinion at all.

- It is profoundly **unethical to talk without doing**, without exposure to harm, without having one's skin in the game — you express your opinion, it can hurt others who rely on it, yet you incur no liability
- This effect of **transferring fragility** is much more acute now, under modernity's connectivity and the newfound invisibility of causal chains — the intellectual today is vastly more powerful and dangerous than before; the "knowledge world" causes separation of knowing and doing (within the same person) and leads to the fragility of society

### Privilege and Obligation

- In the old days, **privilege came with obligations** — you want to be a feudal lord, you will be first to die; you want war, first in battle
- The U.S. Constitution: the **president is commander in chief** — Caesar, Alexander, and Hannibal were on the battlefield; the last, according to Livy, was first-in, last-out of combat zones
- George Washington went to battle, unlike Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush; even **Napoleon** was personally exposed to risks — his showing up during a battle was the equivalent of adding twenty-five thousand troops; Churchill showed an impressive amount of physical courage
- **Status implied you took physical risks** — in traditional societies even those who fail but have taken risks have a higher status than those who are not exposed
- The knowledge business means **shifting to talk** — talk by academics, consultants, and journalists, when it comes to predictions, can be just *talk*, devoid of embodiment and stripped of true evidence
- **Raymond Aron** was right in spite of his predictive abilities while those who were wrong survived beautifully; Aron was as colorless as they come while his enemy, Jean-Paul **Sartre**, got everything wrong yet looked radiant — the coward's books survived

### Thomas Friedman and the Problem of No Penalty

- Taleb describes seeing Thomas Friedman at Davos — the fragilista journalist who helped cause the Iraq war through his influential op-eds, paying no price for the mistake
- Ancient Mediterranean ethics: *Factum tacendo, crimen facias acrius* — for Publilius Syrus, **he who does not stop a crime is an accomplice**

> If you see fraud and don't say fraud, you are a fraud.

- Thomas Friedman was responsible for the Iraq invasion of 2003, and not only paid no penalty but continues to write for the op-ed page of *The New York Times*, confusing innocent people — he got and kept the upside, others get the downside
- His promotion of the **"earth is flat" idea of globalization** without realizing that globalization brings fragilities, causes more extreme events as a side effect, and requires a great deal of redundancies to operate properly
- **Natural and ancestral systems work by penalties**: no perpetual free option given to anyone — society in many things with visible effects works this way; if someone drives a school bus blindfolded and has an accident, he incurs enough penalties
- The problem is that Thomas Friedman is still driving the bus — there is **no penalty for opinion makers** who harm society; the Obama administration after the crisis of 2008 was populated with people who drove the bus blindfolded; the iatrogenists got promoted

### Postdicting

- Bureaucrats (whether in government or large corporations) live in a system of rewards based on narratives, "tawk," and the opinion of others, with job evaluation and peer reviews — in other words, what we call **marketing**
- This is Aristotelian: the biological world evolves by survival, not opinions and "I predicted" and "I told you so" — **evolution dislikes the confirmation fallacy**, endemic in society
- The economic world should also mess things up, but institutions may get bigger — **institutions block evolution** with bailouts and statism
- In the long term, social and economic evolution nastily takes place by surprises, discontinuities, and jumps

### Karl Popper's Missed Point

- Karl Popper's ideas on **evolutionary epistemology**: not being a decision maker, he was under the illusion that ideas compete with each other, with the least wrong surviving at any point in time
- He missed the point that it is not ideas that survive, but **people who have the right ones, or societies that have the correct heuristics**, or the ones, right or wrong, that lead them to do the good thing
- He missed the **Thalesian effect** — a wrong idea that is harmless can survive; those who have wrong heuristics but with a small harm in the event of error will survive
- **"Irrational" behavior can be good if it is harmless**
- Example of a **false belief helpful for survival**: which is more dangerous, to mistake a bear for a stone, or mistake a stone for a bear? It is hard for humans to make the first mistake — our intuitions make us overreact at the smallest probability of harm and fall for a certain class of false patterns
- Those who overreact upon seeing what may look like a bear have had a **survival advantage**; those who made the opposite mistake left the gene pool

> Our mission is to make talk less cheap.

### The Ancients and the Stiglitz Syndrome

- The ancients understood the **Stiglitz syndrome** — and associated ones — rather well, with quite sophisticated mechanisms to counter most aspects of **agency problems**, whether individual or collective (the circular effect of hiding behind the collective)
- The Romans forced engineers to **spend time under the bridge they built** — they would have had Stiglitz and Orszag sleep under the bridge of Fannie Mae and exit the gene pool

### Decimation and the Sacramentum

- Roman soldiers were forced to sign a **sacramentum** accepting punishment in the event of failure — a kind of pact between the soldier and the army spelling out commitment for upside and downside
- The **jungle problem**: facing a wild animal, two people can overcome it by joining forces, but each alone is weak — if you run away, all you need is to be faster than the other person, not the animal; the most optimal strategy would be to just be a coward and let the other perish
- The Romans removed the soldiers' incentive to be a coward through **decimation**: if a legion loses a battle and there is suspicion of cowardice, 10 percent of the soldiers and commanders are put to death, usually by random lottery
- The magic number is **one in ten** (or something equivalent): putting more than 10 percent to death would weaken the army; too little, and cowardice would be a dominant strategy
- The mechanism must have worked well as a deterrent against cowardice, since it was not commonly applied

### To Burn One's Vessels

- Playing on one's inner agency problem can go beyond symmetry: **give soldiers no options** and see how antifragile they can get
- On April 29, 711, the Arab commander **Tarek** crossed the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco into Spain with a small army (the name Gibraltar is derived from the Arabic *Jabal Tarek*, meaning "mount of Tarek")
- Upon landing, Tarek had his **ships put to the fire**, then made a famous speech every schoolchild memorized:

> Behind you is the sea, before you, the enemy. You are vastly outnumbered. All you have is sword and courage.

- Tarek and his small army took control of Spain — the same heuristic has played out throughout history, from **Cortés in Mexico**, to **Agathocles of Syracuse** eight hundred years later
- Lesson: **never put your enemy's back to the wall**

### How Poetry Can Kill You

- The greatest Arabic poet is **Almutanabbi**, who lived about a thousand years ago — his poetry in the original has a hypnotic effect on the reader, rivaled only by Pushkin on Russian speakers
- Almutanabbi's name literally means "He who thinks of himself as a prophet" — his perceived oversized ego; he boasted that his poetry is so potent "that blind people can read it" and "deaf people can listen to it"
- Almutanabbi was a rare case of a **poet with skin in the game**, dying for his poetry — he had vilified a desert tribe in one of his poems and they were out to get him
- When outnumbered and fleeing, one of his companions started reciting his own boastful poem back at him — he turned around and confronted the tribe to his certain death
- Thus Almutanabbi remains, a thousand years later, the poet who died simply to **avoid the dishonor of running away** — and when we recite his verses we know they are genuine

### André Malraux — A Childhood Role Model

- **André Malraux** imbued his writings with his own risk taking — a school dropout, extremely well read, who became an adventurer in Asia in his twenties
- He was an active pilot during the Spanish Civil War and later an active member of the French underground resistance during the Second World War
- He turned out to be a bit of a mythomaniac, but unlike **Hemingway**, who was mostly into image building, Malraux was the real thing — he never engaged in small talk
- He supposedly said *the twenty-first century will be religious or will not be*

### The Problem of Insulation

- The philosopher **Myles Burnyeat** called this the "problem of insulation" — particularly with **skeptics who are skeptics in one domain but not another**
- Example: a philosopher who puzzles about the reality of time, but who nonetheless applies for a research grant to work on the philosophical problem of time during next year's sabbatical — without doubting the reality of next year's arrival
- The philosopher "insulates his ordinary first order judgments from the effects of his philosophizing"
- **Gerd Gigerenzer** reports a serious violation: **Harry Markowitz**, who started "portfolio selection" and received the Swedish Riskbank prize ("Nobel" in economics), does not use his own method for his portfolio — he has recourse to more sophisticated (and simpler to implement) cabdrivers' methodologies, closer to Mandelbrot's approach
- Heuristic: does the scientific researcher whose ideas are applicable to the real world **apply his ideas to his daily life?** If so, take him seriously. Otherwise, ignore him. (Exception: if doing pure mathematics, theology, or teaching poetry, there is no problem)

### Triffat-Type Fakeness: The Talker vs. the Doer

- Method of ignoring what an academic writes and **focusing on what he does** — Taleb met a researcher on happiness who held that *anything one makes beyond $50,000 does not bring any additional happiness*
- The researcher was earning more than twice that at a university, so according to his metric he was safe — yet a year later, Taleb heard that he was particularly avid for dollars and spent his time on the road speaking for fees
- That behavior was **more sufficient evidence than thousands of citations**

### Champagne Socialism

- The divorce between one's "tawk" and one's life can be overtly and convincingly visible — people who want others to live a certain way but don't really like it for themselves
- **Never listen to a leftist who does not give away his fortune** or does not live the exact lifestyle he wants others to follow
- The French call "the caviar left," *la gauche caviar*; Anglo-Saxons call them **champagne socialists** — people who advocate socialism while overtly leading a lavish lifestyle, often financed by inheritance
- Example: French president **François Mitterrand**, coming in on a socialist platform, emulated the pomp of French monarchs; his traditional archenemy, conservative **General de Gaulle**, led a life of old-style austerity
- Taleb's former client who tried to pressure him into writing a check for a candidate on a platform of higher taxes — heroic, since his own taxes would increase; but a year later, the client was being investigated for involvement in a scheme to be **shielded from taxes** while wanting *others* to pay more
- **Ralph Nader**: aside from astonishing personal courage and total indifference toward smear campaigns, he exhibits absolutely **no divorce between what he preaches and his lifestyle** — a secular saint

### Soul in the Game

- There is a class of people who escape bureaucrato-journalistic "tawk": those who have more than their skin in the game — *they have their soul in the game*
- Consider **prophets**: prophecy is a pledge of belief, little else; a prophet is not someone who first had an idea, but the one to first **believe in it** and take it to its conclusion
- Having skin in the game (and accepting downside) is what distinguishes the genuine thinker from ex post "tawk" — but there is one step beyond, to reach the rank of prophet: **doxastic commitment**
- **Doxastic commitment** (what philosophers call it): a type of belief-pledge that to Fat Tony and Nero needed to be translated into deeds (the reverse-Stiglitz); *Doxa* in Greek means "belief," distinguished from "knowledge" (episteme) — it involves a commitment of sorts beyond just words; in church Greek it took the meaning of *glorification*
- The main person behind a theory, the **originator**, is someone who believed in it in a doxastic way, with a costly commitment to take it to its natural conclusion — and not necessarily the first person to mention it over dessert wine or in a footnote
- Only he who has true beliefs will avoid eventually contradicting himself and falling into the errors of **postdicting**

## Chapter 23: Skin in the Game (cont.) — Options, Antifragility, and Social Fairness

### The Stock Market as Transfer of Antifragility

- The stock market: the greatest, industrial-sized, **transfer of antifragility** in history — due to a vicious form of asymmetric skin in the game
- The current system of packaging investments into shares of "public" corporations allowed managers to **game the system**, getting more prestige than the real risk takers, the entrepreneurs
- **The agency problem**: there is a difference between a manager running a company that is not his own and an owner-operated business in which the manager does not need to report numbers to anyone but himself, and has downside
- Corporate managers have **incentives without disincentives** — somehow these managers have been given free options by innocent savers and investors
- The U.S. stock market has cost retirees more than **three trillion dollars in losses** over the past dozen years compared to leaving money in government money market funds, while managers of the companies composing the stock market are richer by close to **four hundred billion dollars** thanks to the asymmetry of the stock option
- Even more outrageous: banks have **lost more than they ever made** in their history, with their managers being paid billions in compensation — taxpayers take the downside, bankers get the upside

### Transfer of Antifragility via Volatility

- The asymmetry is visibly present: **volatility benefits managers** since they only get one side of the payoffs — the more variations, the more value to this asymmetry; hence they are antifragile
- Two scenarios where the market does the same thing on average but follows different paths:
  - **Path 1**: market goes up 50 percent, then goes back down to erase all gains
  - **Path 2**: market does not move at all
- Path 1, the more volatile, is **more profitable to the managers** who can cash in their stock options — so the more jagged the route, the better it is for them
- Society — the retirees — has the **exact opposite payoff** since they finance bankers and chief executives; retirees get less upside than downside
- Society pays for the losses of the bankers, but gets **no bonuses from them** — if you don't see this transfer of antifragility as theft, you certainly have a problem
- The "incentive-based" system supposedly corresponds to capitalism, but managers' interests are aligned with shareholders only on the upside — **there is upside and no downside, no disincentive at all**

### The Robert Rubin Free Option

- **Robert Rubin**, former treasury secretary, earned $120 million from Citibank in bonuses over about a decade — the risks taken by the institution were hidden but the numbers looked good until they didn't (upon the turkey's surprise)
- Citibank collapsed, but he kept his money — taxpayers had to compensate him retrospectively since the government took over the banks' losses
- This type of payoff is very common: **thousands of other executives had it** — same as the architect hiding risks in the basement for delayed collapse and cashing big checks while protected by the legal system
- **Clawback provisions** suggested as a remedy (making people repay past bonuses in cases of subsequent failure) — but managers cannot cash their bonuses immediately, only after three to five years if there are no losses
- This does not solve the problem: **the managers still have a net upside and no net downside** — at no point is their own net worth endangered; the system still contains a high degree of optionality and transfer of fragility
- Same applies to fund managers involved in managing pension funds — they too have **no downside**

### Hammurabi's Rule and Historical Punishments

- Bankers used to be subjected to **Hammurabi's rule** — the tradition in Catalonia was to behead bankers in front of their own banks; bankers tended to skip town before failure was apparent (the fate of Francesco Castello, 1360)
- In modern times, only the **mafia** executes these types of strategies to remove the free option — in 1980, "Vatican banker" Roberto Calvi of Banco Ambrosiano that went bust, ran to London, supposedly committed suicide (later discovered the mafia killed him for losing their money)
- The same fate befell the Las Vegas pioneer **Bugsy Siegel**, who ran an unprofitable casino in which the mafia had investments
- In some countries such as Brazil, even today, **top bankers are made unconditionally liable** to the extent of their own assets

### Which Adam Smith?

- Many right-wingers who cite **Adam Smith** as patron saint of "capitalism" (a word he never uttered) do so without reading him, using his ideas in a self-serving selective manner
- In Book IV of *The Wealth of Nations*, Smith was extremely wary of giving someone **upside without downside** and had doubts about the limited liability of joint-stock companies (ancestor of the modern limited liability corporation)
- Smith detected the problem of managing **other people's business** — the lack of a pilot on the plane:

> The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.

- Smith was even suspicious of their economic performance: **"Joint-stock companies for foreign trade have seldom been able to maintain the competition against private adventurers."**
- The version of "capitalism" you need is with the **minimum number of people in the left column of the Triad** — the central problem of the Soviet system was that it put everyone in charge of economic life in that nasty fragilizing left column

## Chapter 23: Skin in the Game (cont.) — The Antifragility and Ethics of (Large) Corporations

### Corporations vs. Artisans

- While **corporations sell you junk drinks, artisans sell you cheese and wine** — there is a transfer of antifragility from the small in favor of the large, until the large goes bust
- The problem of the commercial world is that it only works by **addition (*via positiva*), not subtraction (*via negativa*)**: pharmaceutical companies don't gain if you avoid sugar; health club machine manufacturers don't benefit from you deciding to lift stones and walk on rocks
- All these firms have to produce "growth in revenues" to satisfy some semi-slow thinking MBA analyst sitting in New York — of course they will eventually self-destruct
- Companies like **Coke or Pepsi**: selling you sugary water or substitutes for sugar, putting into your body stuff that messes up your biological signaling system, *causing* diabetes and making diabetes vendors rich thanks to their compensatory drugs
- Large corporations can't make money selling you **tap water** and cannot produce wine (wine seems to be the best argument in favor of the artisanal economy)
- They dress their products up with a huge **marketing apparatus**, with images that fool the drinker — the arguments used against tobacco firms should apply to all other large companies that try to sell us things that may make us ill

### Debate with PepsiCo Chairperson

- Taleb and historian **Niall Ferguson** debated the chairperson of Pepsi-Cola at the New York Public Library — a great lesson in antifragility, as neither cared about who she was
- Both came totally unprepared while she showed up with a staff of aides with thick files — they could say anything with total impunity while she had to hew to her party line, lest the security analysts issue a bad report
- Corporate executives are **not entrepreneurs** — just slick actors (business schools are more like acting schools); someone intelligent or free would likely implode under such a regimen
- Niall detected her weak point: her slogan was that she contributed to employment by having six hundred thousand persons on her staff — he exposed her propaganda with the counterargument (developed by Marx and Engels) that large bureaucratic corporations seized control of the state just by being "big employers" and can extract benefits at the expense of small businesses

### Small Companies vs. Large Corporations

- A rule: with the exception of drug dealers, **small companies and artisans tend to sell us healthy products**, ones that seem naturally and spontaneously needed
- Larger ones — including pharmaceutical giants — are likely to be in the business of producing **wholesale iatrogenics**, taking our money, and then hijacking the state thanks to their army of lobbyists
- **Anything that requires marketing** appears to carry such side effects — you certainly need an advertising apparatus to convince people that Coke brings them "happiness" — and it works
- Exceptions exist: corporations with even the soul of artisans — Rohan Silva remarked that **Steve Jobs** wanted the inside of Apple products to look aesthetically appealing, although they are designed to remain unseen by the customer; this is something only a true artisan would do — carpenters with personal pride feel fake when treating the inside of cabinets differently from the outside

### Artisans, Marketing, and the Cheapest to Deliver

- There is **no product that Taleb particularly likes that he has discovered through advertising and marketing**: cheeses, wine, meats, eggs, tomatoes, basil leaves, apples, restaurants, barbers, art, books, hotels, shoes, shirts, eyeglasses, pants, olives, olive oil, etc.
- The same applies to cities, museums, art, novels, music, painting, sculpture — **word of mouth is a potent naturalistic filter**, actually the only filter
- The mechanism of **cheapest-to-deliver-for-a-given-specification** pervades whatever you see on the shelves — corporations have an incentive to provide you with the cheapest-to-produce piece of rubber containing the appropriate ingredients that can still be called cheese
- They are structurally designed and extremely expert at delivering the **cheapest possible product** that meets their specifications — same with business books: publishers and authors want to grab your attention and put in your hands the most perishable journalistic item that still can be called a book

### Marketing Is Bad Manners

- **Anything one needs to market heavily is necessarily either an inferior product or an evil one** — it is highly unethical to portray something in a more favorable light than it actually is
- Marketing is like a person on a boat cruise who starts boasting of his accomplishments — you would certainly run away or put him in contact with another talkative bore
- **Three layers of violations** by companies that advertise:
  - **First layer** (mild): companies are shamelessly self-promotional, like the man on the British Air flight — it only harms them
  - **Second layer** (more serious): companies trying to represent themselves in the most favorable light possible, hiding the defects of their products — still harmless, as we tend to expect it
  - **Third layer** (most serious): companies trying to **misrepresent the product** they sell by playing with our cognitive biases, our unconscious associations — showing a poetic picture of a sunset with a cowboy smoking and forcing an association between great romantic moments and a product that has no possible connection to it; you seek a romantic moment and what you get is cancer

### The Corporate System Pushes into the Third Layer

- At the core of the problem with capitalism: **a corporation does not have natural ethics**; it just obeys the balance sheet; its sole mission is satisfying some metric imposed by security analysts, themselves (very) prone to charlatanism
- A (publicly listed) corporation **does not feel shame**, does not feel pity, does not have a sense of honor (while marketing documents mention "pride"), does not have generosity — only self-serving actions are acceptable
- All of these defects are the result of the **absence of skin in the game** — an asymmetry that harms others for their benefit
- Such systems should tend to implode — but the problem of implosion does not matter to the managers because of the **agency problem**: their allegiance is to their own personal cash flow; they will not be harmed by subsequent failures; they will keep their bonuses
- In sum, corporations are so fragile, long-term, that they eventually collapse under the weight of the agency problem — while managers **milk them for bonuses and ditch the bones to taxpayers**
- They would collapse sooner if not for the lobby machines: they start **hijacking the state** to help them inject sugary drinks into your esophagus; in the United States large corporations control some members of Congress

### Lawrence of Arabia or Meyer Lansky

- If you ever have to choose between a mobster's promise and a civil servant's, **go with the mobster** — institutions do not have a sense of honor, individuals do
- During the Great War, **T. E. Lawrence** ("Lawrence of Arabia") struck a deal with Arab desert tribes to help the British against the Ottoman Empire — his promise was to deliver to them in return an Arab state
- But the French and British governments had made the secret **Sykes-Picot Agreement** to divide the area between themselves — Lawrence went back to live in the U.K. in frustration; lesson: **never trust the words of a man who is not free**
- A mobster's greatest asset is that **"his word is gold"** — a handshake from the famous mobster **Meyer Lansky** was worth more than the strongest contracts that a battery of lawyers could put together; he held in his mind the assets and liabilities of the Sicilian mafia without a single record, just his honor
- As a trader, Taleb never trusted transactions with "representatives" of institutions — pit traders are bound by their bonds, and he has never known a self-employed trader over a two-decade-long career who did not live up to his handshake

> Only a sense of honor can lead to commerce. Any commerce.

### Next (Chapter Summary)

- We saw how, thanks to the misunderstanding of antifragility (and asymmetry or convexity), some classes of people use **hidden options** and harm the collective without anyone realizing
- We also saw the solution in **forcing skin in the game**
- Next, we will look at another form of optionality: how people can **cherry-pick ethical rules** to fit their actions, or how they use public office as a means to satisfy personal greed

## Chapter 24: Fitting Ethics to a Profession

- *How the slaves can snatch control — Squeezing the sissies — The tantalized class, permanently tantalized*

### The Acute Modern Problem of Ethics and Profession

- At no time in the history of mankind has the following situation been seen in such an acute form: **Mr. John Smith Jr., JD**, is employed as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry in Washington, D.C., which is engaged in the business of **killing people for profit**
- The powers of subtraction: if we stopped such industries from existing (by, say, banning cigarettes), then everything else done by medicine becomes a footnote
- Ask any of his relatives why they can tolerate it — the answer is likely "everyone needs to make a living," as they are **hedging the possibility** of their falling into the same situation some day

### The Direction of the Arrow

- We need to test the direction of the arrow (using the same logic as lecturing birds on flying):
  - *Ethics (and Beliefs) → Profession* — or —
  - *Profession → Ethics (and Beliefs)*
- The question is: do people choose their profession based on their ethics, or do they **fit their ethics to their profession**?

### Fat Tony, Nero, and Socrates

- Prior to Fat Tony's debate with Socrates, Nero was curious about the first minute of encounter — what element of our physical environment would surprise Socrates the most after twenty-five centuries?
- Questioned by Fat Tony, Nero's speculative reply was: **"It would most certainly be the absence of slaves"**
- Fat Tony: "These people never did small domestic things themselves. So imagine Socrates' sorry figure of a bulging belly, spindly legs, wondering *Opou oi douloi?*" ("Where are the slaves?")

## Chapter 25: Conclusion

- At the end of the journey, **Shaiy Pilpel**, a probabilist with whom Taleb has had a decades-long calm conversation without small talk, asked him to explain the book standing on one leg
- Shaiy summed it up himself: all real ideas can be **distilled down to a central issue** that specialists completely miss — everything in religious law comes down to refinements of the Golden Rule: "Don't do unto others what you don't want them to do to you"
- The Golden Rule was a **true distillation**, not a Procrustean bed — a central argument is never a summary, it is more like a **generator**
- Shaiy's extraction: ***Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty.***
- The glass on the table is **short volatility** — it is dead; living things are **long volatility**

> "The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations."

- **Prometheus is long disorder; Epimetheus is short disorder** — we can separate people by their exposure to and appetite for disorder
- Spartan hoplites contra bloggers, adventurers contra copy editors, Phoenician traders contra Latin grammarians, pirates contra tango instructors
- Everything nonlinear is **convex or concave, or both** — depending on stressor intensity. So everything likes or hates volatility **up to a point**
- We can detect what likes volatility thanks to **convexity** — we can build Black Swan-protected systems thanks to detection of concavity
- We can take **medical decisions** by understanding the convexity of harm and the logic of Mother Nature's tinkering
- Ethics is largely about **stolen convexities and optionality**
- More technically, we may never get to know *x*, but we can play with the exposure to *x*, barbell things to defang them — we can keep changing *f(x)* until comfortable, by a mechanism called **convex transformation** (the barbell)
- This short maxim tells you **where fragility supersedes truth**, why we lie to children, and why we got a bit ahead of ourselves in modernity
- **Distributed randomness** (as opposed to concentrated type) is a necessity, not an option — everything big is short volatility. Big and fast are abominations. Modern times don't like volatility.

> "The glass is dead; living things are long volatility. The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations. Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren't for hunger; results are meaningless without effort, joy without sadness, convictions without uncertainty, and an ethical life isn't so when stripped of personal risks."

## Epilogue: From Resurrection to Resurrection

- **Fat Tony dies** of an aortic aneurism while Nero is in the Levant for his annual celebration of the death and rebirth of Adonis — a period of mourning with wailing women, followed by a celebration of resurrection
- Nero was designated executor of Tony's will — the estate was **flawless**: debt-free, conservative, fairly distributed, with discreet funds for a woman (antifragile obsessive love)
- **The posthumous prank**: Tony bequeathed Nero twenty million dollars to spend at his discretion on a **secret mission** — noble, but secret, vague, and dangerous
- It was the best compliment Nero ever got from Tony: **trusting that Nero would be able to read his mind**
- Which he did.

## Appendix I: Technical Companion (Continued)

### Technical Version of Fat Tony's "Not the Same 'Ting'" — The Conflation of Events and Exposure to Events

- This section also explains the **"convex transformation"**
- **f(x)** is *exposure* to the variable **x** — it can equivalently be called "payoff from x," "exposure to x," or even "utility of payoff from x," where we introduce **f** as a utility function; **x** can be anything
- **Example — Earthquake**: x is the intensity of an earthquake on some scale in some specific area; f(x) is the number of persons dying from it — we can easily see that f(x) can be made more predictable than x (if we force people to stay away from a specific area or build to some standards, etc.)
- **Example — Falling**: x is the number of meters of a fall to the ground when someone pushes you from height x; f(x) is a measure of physical condition from the effect of the fall — clearly you cannot predict x (who will push you), but you can manage f(x) (the effect)
- **Example — Traffic**: x is the number of cars in NYC at noon tomorrow; f(x) is travel time from point A to point B for a certain agent — f(x) can be made more predictable than x (take the subway, or even better, walk)
- Some people talk about f(x) thinking they are talking about x — this is the problem of the **conflation of event and exposure**
- This error is present in **Aristotle** and is virtually ubiquitous in the philosophy of probability (e.g., **Hacking**)
- One can become **antifragile to x without understanding x**, through convexity of f(x)
- The answer to "what do you do in a world you don't understand?" is simply: work on the undesirable states of f(x)
- It is often easier to modify f(x) than to get better knowledge of x — in other words, **robustification rather than forecasting Black Swans**
- **Example — Insurance barbell**: If you buy insurance on the market dropping more than 20%, f(x) will be independent of the part of the probability distribution of x that is below 20%, and impervious to changes in its scale parameter — this is an example of a **barbell**

### Convex Transformation (Figure 27)

- **Figure 27** illustrates the difference between x and exposure to x via a **convex transformation** (f(x) is a convex function of x)
- The top graph shows the **probability distribution of x** — a symmetrical bell curve
- The bottom graph shows the **probability distribution of f(x)** — right-skewed, with no downside risk
- The key is to modify f(x) in order to make knowledge of the properties of x on the left side of the distribution as irrelevant as possible
- This operation is called **convex transformation**, nicknamed **"barbell"**

### Green Lumber Fallacy (Technical Definition)

- **Green lumber fallacy**: When one confuses f(x) for another function g(x) — one that has different nonlinearities
- This is a precise technical restatement of why confusing the source of knowledge doesn't matter if you get the exposure function right

### Antifragility and Variance (Technical)

- If one is **antifragile to x**, then the variance (or other measures of variation) of x **benefit** f(x), since distributions that are skewed have their mean depend on the variance
- When skewed right, their expectation **increases with variance** — the lognormal, for instance, has for mean a term that includes **+½ σ²**
- The **probability distribution of f(x)** is markedly different from that of x, particularly in the presence of nonlinearities
- When f(x) is **convex (concave) monotonically**, f(x) is **right (left) skewed**
- When f(x) is increasing and convex on the left then concave to the right, the probability distribution of f(x) is **thinner-tailed** than that of x — for instance, in **Kahneman-Tversky's prospect theory**, the so-called utility of changes in wealth is more "robust" than that of wealth

### Why Payoff Matters More Than Probability (Technical)

- Where **p(x)** is the density, the expectation — ∫ f(x)p(x)dx — will depend increasingly on **f** rather than **p**
- The more **nonlinear f** is, the more the expectation depends on f rather than p
- This is a fundamental insight: the shape of the payoff function matters more than getting the probability distribution right

---

### The Fourth Quadrant (Taleb, 2009)

- The idea is that **tail events are not computable** (in fat-tailed domains), but we can assess our **exposure** to the problem
- Assume f(x) is an increasing function — **Table 10** connects the idea to the notion of the **Fourth Quadrant**:
  - **f(x) "mitigating" by clipping extreme outcomes (convex-concave)** + **Thin-tailed distribution for x** = Very robust outcome
  - **f(x) "mitigating" (convex-concave)** + **Fat-tailed distribution for x** = Quite robust outcome
  - **f(x) concave-convex, exacerbates remote outcomes** + **Thin-tailed distribution for x** = Robust outcome (sort of)
  - **f(x) concave-convex** + **Fat-tailed distribution for x** = **FOURTH QUADRANT** — Fragile (if f(x) is concave) or antifragile
- The **Fourth Quadrant** is the danger zone: fat-tailed distributions combined with concave-convex exposure functions that exacerbate remote outcomes

---

### Local and Global Convexities (Technical)

- **Nothing is open-ended in nature** — death is a maximum outcome for a unit
- Things end up **convex on one end, concave on the other**
- In fact, there is **maximum harm** at some point in things biological
- Revisiting the concave figure of the **stone and pebbles** from Chapter 18: by widening the range we see that **boundedness of harm brings convexities** somewhere
- **Concavity was dominant, but local** — Figure 28 shows the broader range
- **Figure 28** (top graph): At some point the concave turns convex as we hit **maximum harm** — the harm from the stone is bounded
- **Figure 28** (bottom graph): Shows strong antifragility with **no known upper limit** (leading to **Extremistan**) — these payoffs are only available in **economic variables** (sales of books, or matters unbounded or near-unbounded); Taleb is unable to find such an effect in nature

### Weak Antifragility (Mediocristan) — Figure 29

- **Figure 29** shows **weak antifragility** with a **bounded maximum** — typical in nature
- The response curve is S-shaped (sigmoid): initially convex, then concave, with a ceiling on maximum benefit
- This is the dose-response pattern seen in biological systems — **Mediocristan**-style antifragility

---

### Freak Nonlinearities (Very Technical)

- The next two types of nonlinearities are **almost never seen outside of economic variables** — they are particularly limited to those caused by **derivatives**
- **Figure 30** (top graph): Shows a **convex-concave increasing function** — the opposite of the bounded dose-response functions seen in nature; it leads to **Type 2, Fragile** (very, very fat tails)
- **Figure 30** (bottom graph): Shows the most dangerous of all — **pseudoconvexity**: **local antifragility, global fragility**
- Pseudoconvexity is extremely dangerous because it creates the illusion of benefiting from volatility locally while being devastatingly fragile at the global level

---

### Medical Nonlinearities and Their Probability Correspondence (Chapters 21 & 22)

- **Figure 31 — Medical Iatrogenics**: Shows the case of **small benefits and large Black Swan-style losses** seen in probability space
- **Iatrogenics** occurs when we have small identifiable gains (avoidance of small discomfort or a minor infection) and exposure to **Black Swans with delayed invisible large side effects** (death)
- These **concave benefits from medicine** are just like selling a financial option (plenty of risk) against small tiny immediate gains while claiming "evidence of no harm"
- For a **healthy person**, there is a small probability of disastrous outcomes (discounted because unseen and not taken into account) and a high probability of mild benefits

### Nonlinearities in Biology — Figure 32

- **Figure 32** shows the shape **convex-concave** that necessarily flows from anything increasing (monotone, never decreasing) and **bounded** (with maximum and minimum values — does not reach infinity from either side)
- At **low levels**, the dose response is **convex** (gradually more and more effective)
- **Additional doses** tend to become gradually ineffective or start hurting — this is the concave region
- This type of graph necessarily applies to any situation **bounded on both sides**, with a known minimum and maximum (**saturation**), which includes happiness
- If one considers that there exists a maximum level of happiness and unhappiness, then the general shape of this curve with **convexity on the left and concavity on the right** has to hold for happiness (replace "dose" with "wealth" and "response" with "happiness")
- **Kahneman-Tversky prospect theory** models a similar shape for "utility" of changes in wealth, which they discovered empirically

### Medical Breakeven — Figure 33

- **Figure 33** illustrates the **hypertension example**: on the vertical axis, net benefits of a treatment; on the horizontal, severity of the condition
- The arrow points at the level where **probabilistic gains match probabilistic harm** — the **medical breakeven point**
- **Iatrogenics disappears nonlinearly** as a function of the severity of the condition
- When the patient is **very ill**, the distribution shifts to **antifragile** (thicker right tail), with large benefits from the treatment over possible iatrogenics, little to lose
- If you increase the treatment you hit concavity from maximum benefits — seen more broadly, it would look like the convex-concave curve

### Hormesis — Figure 34

- **Figure 34** (top graph): Shows **hormesis for an organism** — a stage of benefits as the dose increases (initially convex) slowing down into a phase of harm as we increase dose further (initially concave)
- Then things **flatten out at the level of maximum harm** — beyond a certain point, the organism is dead, so there is a **bounded and known worst-case scenario in biology**
- **Figure 34** (bottom graph): Shows a **wrong graph of hormesis** in medical textbooks — showing initial concavity, with a beginning that looks linear or slightly concave (this is incorrect)

---

### The Inverse Turkey Problem

- **Figure 35** illustrates the **Antifragile, Inverse Turkey Problem**: the unseen rare event is **positive**
- **Top graph**: When you look at a **positively skewed (antifragile)** time series and make inferences about the unseen, you miss the good stuff and **underestimate the benefits** (the **Pisano, 2006a, 2006b** mistake)
- **Bottom graph**: The other Harvard problem, that of **Froot (2001)** — the filled/shaded area corresponds to what we do not tend to see in small samples, from insufficiency of data points
- Interestingly the shaded area **increases with model error**
- The technical sections call the zone **ω_B** (turkey) and **ω_C** (inverse turkey)
- This is the mirror image of the regular turkey problem: instead of unseen negative Black Swans, here the unseen rare events are **positive** — leading to systematic underestimation of upside

### Difference Between Point Estimates and Distributions

- Applying this analysis to how **planners make mistakes** and why **deficits tend to be worse than planned**
- **Figure 36** (top graph): Shows the probability distribution of outcomes from costs of projects **in the minds of planners** — they assume costs will be both low and quite certain (a very narrow spike)
- **Figure 36** (bottom graph): Shows the probability distribution **in reality** — outcomes are both worse and more spread out, particularly with higher possibility of unfavorable outcomes
- Note the **fragility increase** owing to the swelling **left tail**
- This misunderstanding of the effect of uncertainty applies to **government deficits**, plans that have **IT components**, **travel time** (to a lesser degree), and many more
- The same graph shows **model error from underestimating fragility** by assuming that a parameter is constant when it is random — this is what plagues **bureaucrat-driven economics**

## Appendix II (Very Technical): Where Most Economic Models Fragilize and Blow People Up

- Taleb admits: "When I said 'technical' in the main text, I may have been fibbing. Here I am not."

### The Markowitz Incoherence

- **The Markowitz incoherence**: Assume someone tells you that the probability of an event is exactly zero. You ask where he got this from. If "Baal told me" — the person is coherent (but would be deemed unrealistic by non-Baalists)
- But if the person says "I *estimated* it to be zero," we have a problem — the person is **both unrealistic and inconsistent**
- Something estimated needs to have an **estimation error** — so probability cannot be zero if it is estimated
- Its **lower bound is linked to the estimation error**: the higher the estimation error, the higher the probability, up to a point
- As with **Laplace's argument** of total ignorance, an infinite estimation error pushes the probability toward **½**
- The key mistake: anything estimating a parameter and then putting it into an equation is different from estimating the equation across parameters (same story as the health of the grandmother — the average temperature, here "estimated," is irrelevant; what we need is **average health across temperatures**)
- **Markowitz** showed his incoherence by starting his "semi-nal" paper with "Assume you know E and V" (the expectation and the variance) — at the end of the paper he accepts that they need to be estimated, and what is worse, with a combination of statistical techniques and "judgment of practical men"
- If these parameters need to be estimated with an error, then the **derivations need to be written differently** — and of course, we would have no paper, and no Markowitz paper, no blowups, no modern finance, no **fragilistas** teaching junk to students
- **Economic models are extremely fragile to assumptions** — a slight alteration in assumptions can lead to extremely consequential differences in results
- Many of these models are **"back-fit" to assumptions** — the hypotheses are selected to make the math work, which makes them **ultrafragile and ultrafragilizing**

### Simple Example: Government Deficits

- The deficit example illustrates how governments and government agencies currently **miss convexity terms** (and have a hard time accepting it)
- The example illustrates two problems:
  - (a) **Missing the stochastic character** of a variable known to affect the model but deemed deterministic (and fixed)
  - (b) **F**, the function of such variable, is **convex or concave** with respect to the variable
- A government estimates unemployment for the next three years as averaging **9 percent**; it uses its econometric models to issue a forecast balance **B** of a **two-hundred-billion deficit** in local currency
- But it misses (like almost everything in economics) that **unemployment is a stochastic variable** — employment over a three-year period has fluctuated by **1 percent** on average
- Calculating the effect of the error:
  - Unemployment at 8%, Balance B(8%) = −75 bn (improvement of 125 bn)
  - Unemployment at 9%, Balance B(9%) = −200 bn
  - Unemployment at 10%, Balance B(10%) = −550 bn (worsening of 350 bn)
- The **concavity bias** (negative convexity bias) from underestimation of the deficit is **−112.5 bn**, since ½ {B(8%) + B(10%)} = −312 bn, not −200 bn
- This is the exact case of the **inverse philosopher's stone** — variability systematically worsens the outcome because of concavity

### Figure 37: Nonlinear Transformations Detect Convexity Bias and Fragility

- **Figure 37** shows a Monte Carlo simulation of government deficit as a **left-tailed random variable** simply as a result of randomizing unemployment, of which it is a **concave function**
- The method of **point estimate** would assume a Dirac stick at −200, thus underestimating both the **expected deficit (−312)** and the **tail fragility** of it
- From **Taleb and Douady, 2012**

### Application: Ricardian Model and Left Tail — The Price of Wine Happens to Vary

- For almost two hundred years, we've been talking about **David Ricardo's** idea of **"comparative advantage"** — a country should have a certain policy based on its comparative advantage in wine or clothes
- The analogy by **Paul Samuelson**: if someone is both the best doctor and the best secretary in town, it would be preferable to be the higher-earning doctor and let someone else be the secretary
- Taleb agrees there are benefits in *some* form of specialization, but **not from the models used to prove it**
- The flaw: it would be inconceivable for a doctor to become a part-time secretary just because he is good at it — being a doctor insures professional stability (people will not cease to get sick), and there is higher social status associated with the profession than that of secretary
- But in a **two-country world**, a country specialized in wine, hoping to sell its specialty to the other country, faces the risk that **suddenly the price of wine drops precipitously**
- Ricardo's analysis assumes that both the **market price of wine and the costs of production remain constant** — there is no "second order" part of the story
- **Table 11 — Ricardo's Original Example** (costs of production per unit): Britain produces cloth at 100, wine at 110; Portugal produces cloth at 90, wine at 80
- The "paradox": Portugal produces cloth cheaper than Britain but should buy cloth from there instead, using the gains from wine sales — in the absence of transaction costs, it's efficient for Britain to produce just cloth and Portugal to only produce wine
- **Paul Krugman** in "Why Intellectuals Don't Understand Comparative Advantage" (1998) makes fun of intellectuals like **S. J. Gould** who understand tail events albeit intuitively rather than analytically — yet Krugman himself fails to understand the concept, as his essay and technical work show him to be completely innocent of tail events and risk management
- Krugman falls into the critical and dangerous mistake of **confusing function of average and average of function** (traditional Ricardian analysis assumes variables are endogenous but does not add a layer of stochasticity)
- Now consider the price of wine and clothes **variable** — not assumed to be the unbiased average long-term value, but following a **fat-tailed distribution**; or consider that costs of production vary according to a fat-tailed distribution
- If the price of wine **rises by 40 percent**, there are clear benefits — but should the price drop by an equal percentage (−40%), then **massive harm** would ensue, in magnitude larger than the benefits should there be an equal rise — there are **concavities to the exposure**, severe concavities
- A **90 percent price drop** would be disastrous — imagine getting an instant and unpredicted 40 percent pay cut
- Historical problems with countries specializing in some goods, commodities, and crops that happen to be **not just volatile, but extremely volatile**
- Disaster does not necessarily come from variation in price but from **problems in production**: a germ, bad weather, or some other hindrance
- **The Irish potato famine** (around 1850): A bad crop caused the death of a million and the emigration of a million more (Ireland's entire population was only about six million) — **monoculture** (focus on a single crop) has turned out to be one of the most **lethal in history**; one bad crop leads to devastating famines
- The **doctor-typist analogy breaks down** because countries don't have family and friends, a support community, a father-in-law to borrow from, a state above to help — countries don't have savings; countries tend to be **borrowers**
- So here again we have **fragility to second-order effects**

### Probability Matching

- The idea of comparative advantage has an analog in probability: sampling from an urn (with replacement) getting black ball 60% of the time and white 40% — the **optimal strategy** according to textbooks is to bet 100% on black
- The strategy of betting 60% on black and 40% on white is called **"probability matching"** and considered to be an error in the decision-science literature
- But people's instinct to engage in **probability matching** appears to be sound, not a mistake — in nature, probabilities are **unstable** (or unknown), and probability matching is similar to **redundancy**, as a buffer
- If the probabilities change — i.e., if there is another layer of randomness — then the optimal strategy is probability matching

### How Specialization Works

- Taleb clarifies he is not saying specialization is not a good thing — only that one should establish such specialization **after addressing fragility and second-order effects**
- He believes **Ricardo** is ultimately right, but not from the models shown — organically, systems without top-down controls would specialize **progressively, slowly**, and over a long time, through **trial and error**, getting the right amount of specialization
- Not through some bureaucrat using a model — systems make small errors, design makes large ones
- The imposition of Ricardo's insight-turned-model by some **social planner** would lead to a blowup; letting **tinkering work slowly** would lead to efficiency — true efficiency
- The role of policy makers should be, ***via negativa*** style, to **allow the emergence of specialization** by preventing what hinders the process

---

### A More General Methodology to Spot Model Error

- **Model second-order effects and fragility**: Assume we have the right model (a very generous assumption) but are uncertain about the parameters
- As a generalization of the deficit/employment example: using a simple function *f(x|α)*, where *α̅* is supposed to be the average expected input variable, with *φ* as the distribution of *α* over its domain
- **The philosopher's stone**: The mere fact that *α* is uncertain (since it is estimated) might lead to a **bias** if we perturbate from the *inside* (of the integral), i.e., stochasticize the parameter deemed fixed
- The **convexity bias** is easily measured as the difference between (a) the function *f* integrated across values of potential *α*, and (b) *f* estimated for a single value of *α* deemed to be its average
- This convexity bias (the "philosopher's stone") *ω_A* is formally expressed as the integral difference between the stochasticized and point-estimated versions of the function

### The Central Equation — Fragility Detection

- **Fragility** is a partial philosopher's stone below *K* — hence *ω_B*, the missed fragility, is assessed by comparing the two integrals below *K* to capture the effect on the **left tail**
- The equation can be approximated by an interpolated estimate obtained with two values of *α* separated from a midpoint by *Δα* (its mean deviation)
- Note that **antifragility** *ω_C* is integrating from *K* to infinity
- We can probe *ω_B* by point estimates of *f* at a level of *X ≤ K*
- The **detection heuristic** is a perturbation in the tails to probe fragility, by checking the function *ω'_B(X)* at any level *X*
- This leads to the **fragility detection heuristic** (Taleb, Canetti, et al., 2012): if *ω'_B(X)* has a constant sign for *X ≤ K*, then *ω_B(K)* has the same sign

### Table 12 — Sources of Fragility in Economic Models

- **Portfolio theory / mean-variance**: Source of fragility is assuming knowledge of the parameters, not integrating models across parameters, relying on very unstable correlations; assumes *ω_A* (bias) and *ω_B* (fragility) = 0. Remedy: **1/n** (spread across as large a number of exposures as manageable), **barbells**, progressive and organic construction
- **Ricardian comparative advantage**: Source is missing a layer of randomness in the price of wine that may imply total reversal of allocation; assumes *ω_A* and *ω_B* = 0. Remedy: natural systems find their own allocation through **tinkering**
- **Samuelson optimization**: Concentration of sources of randomness under concavity of loss function; assumes *ω_A* and *ω_B* = 0. Remedy: **distributed randomness**
- **Arrow-Debreu lattice / state-space**: Ludic fallacy — assumes exhaustive knowledge of outcomes and knowledge of probabilities; assumes *ω_A*, *ω_B*, and *ω_C* (antifragility) = 0. Remedy: use of **metaprobabilities** which changes entire model implications
- **Dividend cash flow models**: Missing stochasticity causing convexity effects; mostly considers *ω_C* (antifragility) = 0. Remedy: **heuristics**

### Portfolio Fallacies

- A fallacy promoted by Markowitz users: *"portfolio theory entices people to diversify, hence it is better than nothing"* — Taleb says this is **wrong**
- It pushes people to **optimize**, hence **overallocate** — it does not drive people to take less risk based on diversification, but causes them to take **more open positions** owing to the perception of offsetting statistical properties
- This makes them vulnerable to **model error** and especially to the **underestimation of tail events**
- Example: two investors facing a choice of allocation across cash, securities *A* and *B* — the investor who does not know the statistical properties will allocate conservatively (putting what he doesn't want to lose in cash); the investor who *thinks* he knows the parameters (σ_A, σ_B, ρ_{A,B}) will allocate in a way that puts total risk at some target level
- The **lower his perception of the correlation** ρ_{A,B}, the worse his exposure to model error
- If he thinks ρ_{A,B} = 0, he will be **overallocated by ⅓** for extreme events
- If he has the illusion that the correlation is −1, he will be **maximally overallocated** to his *A* and *B* investments
- If the investor uses leverage, we end up with the story of **Long-Term Capital Management** (LTCM) — fooled by the parameters
- In real life, unlike in economic papers, things tend to change — parameters change
- Taleb noticed as a trader that **correlations were never the same** in different measurements — unstable would be a mild word; 0.8 over a long period becomes −0.2 over another long period
- At times of stress, correlations experience even more abrupt changes without any reliable regularity, in spite of attempts to model "stress correlations"
- **Taleb (1997)** deals with the effects of stochastic correlations: one is only safe shorting a correlation at 1, and buying it at −1 — which corresponds to what the **1/n heuristic** does

### Kelly Criterion vs. Markowitz

- For a full **Markowitz-style optimization**, one needs to know the entire joint probability distribution of all assets for the entire future, plus the exact utility function for wealth at all future times — and without errors (estimation errors make the system explode)
- **Kelly's method**, developed around the same period, requires no joint distribution or utility function — in practice one needs the ratio of expected profit to worst-case return, dynamically adjusted to **avoid ruin**
- In the case of **barbell transformations**, the worst case is guaranteed, and model error is much, much milder under Kelly criterion
- References: **Thorp** (1971, 1998), **Haigh** (2000)
- **Aaron Brown** holds that Kelly's ideas were rejected by economists — in spite of the practical appeal — because of their love of general theories for all asset prices
- **Bounded trial and error** is compatible with the Kelly criterion — even when one is ignorant of the returns, if losses are bounded, the payoff will be robust and should outperform that of "Fragilista Markowitz"

### Corporate Finance

- Corporate finance seems to be based on **point projections**, not distributional projections
- If one perturbates cash flow projections in the **Gordon valuation model**, replacing the fixed-and-known growth (and other parameters) by continuously varying jumps (particularly under **fat-tailed distributions**), companies deemed "expensive" or those with high growth but low earnings could markedly **increase in expected value**
- Something the market prices heuristically but without explicit reason

### Conclusion on Model Error

- Something the economics establishment has been missing is that having the right model (a very generous assumption) but being **uncertain about the parameters** will invariably lead to an **increase in fragility** in the presence of convexity and nonlinearities

## Fuhgetaboud Small Probabilities

### How Fat Tails (Extremistan) Come from Nonlinear Responses to Model Parameters

- Rare events have a property missed at the time of writing: we deal with them using a model (a mathematical contraption that takes input parameters and outputs the probability)
- The more **parameter uncertainty** there is in a model designed to compute probabilities, the more **small probabilities tend to be underestimated**
- Simply, small probabilities are **convex** to errors of computation, as an airplane ride is concave to errors and disturbances (it gets longer, not shorter)
- The more sources of disturbance one forgets to take into account, the longer the airplane ride compared to the naive estimation
- To compute probability using a standard Normal distribution, one needs a parameter called **standard deviation** (σ) — uncertainty about σ has the effect of making the small probabilities **rise**
- For a "**three sigma**" event (which should take place no more than 1 in 740 observations), the probability **rises by 60%** if one moves σ up by 5%, and drops by only 40% if we move σ down by 5%
- So if your error is on average a tiny 5%, the underestimation from a naive model is about **20%** — great asymmetry
- It gets worse for more deviations: the "**six sigma**" ones (chronically frequent in economics) — a rise of **five times more**
- The rarer the event (the higher the "sigma"), the worse the effect from small uncertainty about what to put in the equation
- With events such as **ten sigma**, the difference is more than **a billion times**
- Smaller and smaller probabilities require **more and more precision** in computation — the smaller the probability, the more a small, very small rounding in the computation makes the asymmetry **massively insignificant**
- For tiny, very small probabilities, you need near-infinite precision in the parameters; the slightest uncertainty causes **mayhem** — they are very convex to perturbations
- This is the argument Taleb has used to show that **small probabilities are incomputable**, even if one has the right model — which of course we don't
- The same argument relates to deriving probabilities **nonparametrically**, from past frequencies — if the probability gets close to 1/sample size, the error explodes
- This explains the error of **Fukushima** and **Fannie Mae**
- To summarize: small probabilities increase in an **accelerated manner** as one changes the parameter that enters their computation

### Figure 38 — Convexity of Probability to Standard Deviation

- The probability is **convex** to standard deviation in a Gaussian model — the plot shows the STD effect on P>x, comparing P>6 with STD of 1.5 to P>6 assuming a linear combination of 1.2 and 1.8
- The worrisome fact is that a perturbation in σ extends well into the **tail of the distribution** in a convex way
- The risks of a portfolio that is sensitive to the tails would **explode** — and we are still in the Gaussian world
- Such explosive uncertainty isn't the result of natural fat tails in the distribution, merely **small imprecision about a future parameter** — it is just **epistemic**
- So those who use these models while admitting parameter uncertainty are necessarily committing a **severe inconsistency**
- Of course, uncertainty **explodes even more** when we replicate conditions of the non-Gaussian real world upon perturbating **tail exponents** — even with a powerlaw distribution, the results are severe, particularly under variations of the tail exponent as these have **massive consequences**
- Really, **fat tails mean incomputability of tail events**, little else

### Compounding Uncertainty (Fukushima)

- Using the earlier statement that **estimation implies error**, extend the logic: errors have errors; these in turn have errors
- Taking into account the effect makes all small probabilities rise regardless of model — even in the Gaussian — to the point of reaching **fat tails and powerlaw effects** (even the so-called infinite variance) when higher orders of uncertainty are large
- Even taking a Gaussian with σ the standard deviation having a proportional error *a(1)*; *a(1)* has an error rate *a(2)*, etc. — it depends on the higher order error rate *a(n)* related to *a(n−1)*
- If these are in **constant proportion**, then we converge to a very **thick-tailed distribution**; if proportional errors decline, we still have fat tails — in all cases, mere error is not a good thing for small probability
- The sad part is that getting people to accept that every measure has an error has been nearly impossible — the event in **Fukushima** held to happen **once per million years** would turn into **once per 30** if one percolates the different layers of uncertainty in the adequate manner

### Footnotes on the Technical Material

- The difference between the two sides of **Jensen's inequality** corresponds to a notion in information theory, the **Bregman divergence** (Briys, Magdalou, and Nock, 2012)
- This further shows the defects of the notion of "**Knightian uncertainty**" — since *all* tails are uncertain under the slightest perturbation and their effect is severe in fat-tailed domains (i.e., economic life)

---

## Additional Notes, Afterthoughts, and Further Reading

- These are additional readings and ideas that came to Taleb after the composition of the book — topics include whether God is considered robust or antifragile by theologians, or the history of measurement as a sucker problem in the probability domain
- He managed to bury some mathematical material in the text without **Alexis K.**, the math-phobic London editor, catching him (particularly the definition of fragility in the notes for Book V and the derivation of "small is beautiful")

### Seclusion

- Since *The Black Swan*, Taleb has spent **1,150 days** in physical seclusion, a soothing state of more than 300 days a year with minimal contact with the outside world — plus 20 years of thinking about nonlinearities and nonlinear exposures
- He has lost patience with institutional and cosmetic knowledge — science and knowledge are convincing and deepened rigorous argument taken to its conclusion, not naive (*via positiva*) empiricism or fluff
- He refuses the commoditized journalistic idea of "reference" / "further reading" — his results should not depend on a single paper or result, except for ***via negativa*** debunking (which are illustrative)

### Charlatans

- In the **"fourth quadrant"** paper published in *International Journal of Forecasting* (one of the backup documents for *The Black Swan*), Taleb showed *empirically* using all economic data available that **fat tails are both severe and intractable** — hence all methods with "squares" don't work with socioeconomic variables: regression, standard deviation, correlation, etc.
- Technically, **80% of the Kurtosis** in 10,000 pieces of data can come from *one single observation*, meaning all measures of fat tails are just sampling errors
- This is a very strong ***via negativa*** statement: it means we **can't use covariance matrices** — they are unreliable and uninformative
- Actually just accepting fat tails would have led us to such a result — no need for empiricism; he processed the data nevertheless
- Now any honest scientific profession would say: "what do we do with such evidence?" — the economics and finance establishment just **ignored it**, a bunch of charlatans by any scientific norm and ethical metric
- Many "**Nobels**" (**Engle, Merton, Scholes, Markowitz, Miller, Samuelson, Sharpe**, and a few more) have their results grounded in such central assumptions, and all their works would evaporate otherwise
- Charlatans (and fragilistas) do well in institutions — it is a matter of ethics
- Taleb ignores any economic paper that uses regression in fat-tailed domains — as just hot air — except in some cases such as **Pritchet (2001)**, where the result is not impacted by fat tails

## Additional Notes: Prologue & Book I — The Antifragile: An Introduction

### Antifragility and Complexity

- **Bar-Yam and Epstein (2004)** define sensitivity (the possibility of large response to small stimuli) and robustness (the possibility of small response to large stimuli) — in fact, this sensitivity, when the response is positive, resembles **antifragility**

### Private Correspondence with Bar-Yam

- **Yaneer Bar-Yam** generously commented: "If we take a step back and more generally consider the issue of **partitioned versus connected systems**, partitioned systems are more stable, and connected systems are both more vulnerable and have more opportunities for collective action"
- **Vulnerability (fragility)** is connectivity without responsiveness; responsiveness enables connectivity to lead to opportunity
- If collective action can be employed to address threats or take advantage of opportunities, then the vulnerability can be mitigated and outweighed by the benefits
- This is the basic relationship between the idea of sensitivity and the concept of antifragility

### Damocles and Complexification

- **Tainter (1988)** argues that sophistication leads to fragility — but following a very different line of reasoning

### Danchin's Systemic Antifragility and Redefinition of Hormesis

- **Danchin et al. (2011)**: "The idea behind is that in the fate of a collection of entities, exposed to serious challenges, it may be possible to obtain a positive overall outcome. Within the collection, one of the entities would fare extremely well, compensating for the collapse of all the others and even doing much better than the bulk if unchallenged"
- With this view, **hormesis** is just a holistic description of underlying scenarios acting at the level of a population of processes, structures, or molecules, just noting the positive outcome for the whole
- For living organisms this could act at the level of the population of organisms, the population of cells, or the population of intracellular molecules
- This explores how antifragility could operate at the latter level, noting that its implementation has features highly reminiscent of what we name **natural selection** — if antifragility is a built-in process that permits some individual entities to stand out from the bulk in a challenging situation, thereby improving the fate of the whole, it would illustrate the implementation of a process that gathers and utilises information

- **Stasavage (2012)** is critical of the oligarchic city-state as an engine of long-term growth (though initially high growth rate)

### Complexity and Fat Tails

- More interested here in the effect on fat tails than other attributes. See **Kaufman (1995)**, **Hilland (1995)**, **Bar-Yam (2001)**, **Miller and Page (2007)**, **Sornette (2004)**
- No need to load the math here (left to the technical companion); simple rigorous arguments can prove with minimal words how **fat tails emerge from some attributes of complex systems**
- The important mathematical effect comes from **lack of independence of random variables** which prevents convergence to the Gaussian basin

### How Fat Tails Emerge from Leverage and Feedback Loops

- **A — Why fat tails emerge from leverage and feedback loops, single agent simplified case**:
  - **A1 [leverage]**: If an agent with some leverage L buys securities in response to increase in his wealth (from the increase of the value of securities held), and sells them in response to decrease in their value to maintain a certain level of leverage L (he is **concave in exposure**)
  - **A2 [feedback effects]**: If securities rise nonlinearly in value in response to purchases and decline in value in response to sales, then by the violation of the independence between the variations of securities, **CLT** (the central limit theorem) no longer holds (no convergence to the Gaussian basin) — so **fat tails are an immediate result of feedback and leverage**, exacerbated by the concavity from the level of leverage L
  - **A3**: If feedback effects are **concave to size** (it costs more per unit to sell 10 than to sell 1), then negative skewness of the security and the wealth process will emerge — simply, like the "negative gamma" of portfolio insurance: the agent has an option in buying but no option in selling, hence **negative skewness** — the forced selling is exactly like the hedging of a **short option**
- **Note on path dependence exacerbating skewness**: if wealth increases first, this causes more risk and skew — squeezes and forced selling on the way down: the market drops more (but less frequently) than it rises on the way up
- **B — Multiagents**: if furthermore more than one agent is involved, the effect is compounded by the dynamic adjustment (hedging) of one agent causing the adjustment of another — commonly called "**contagion**"
- **C**: One can generalize to anything, such as home prices rising in response to excess liquidity, etc.
- The same general idea of forced execution plus concavity of costs leads to the **superiority of systems with distributed randomness**

### Increase of Risk Upon Being Provided Numbers

- See the literature on **anchoring** (reviewed in *The Black Swan*). Also **Mary Kate Stimmler's** doctoral thesis at Berkeley (2012), courtesy **Phil Tetlock**
- **Stimmler's experiment**: In the simple condition, subjects were told: "For your reference, you have been provided with the following formula for calculating the total amount of money (*T*) the investment will make three months after the initial investment (*I*) given the rate of return (*R*): **T=I*R**"
- In the complex condition, subjects were told the same thing but with a deliberately intimidating, complex formula involving summations and subscripts
- Needless to mention that the simple condition and the complex one produced the same output — but those who had the complex condition **took more risks**

### The Delusion of Probabilistic Measurement

- Something obvious to cabdrivers and grandmothers disappears inside university hallways
- In his book *The Measure of Reality*, **Alfred Crosby (1997)** presented the following thesis: what distinguished Western Europe from the rest of the world is **obsession with measurement**, the transformation of the qualitative into the quantitative
- He cites the first mechanical clock (which quantized time), marine charts, perspective painting (which quantized space), and **double-entry bookkeeping** (which quantized financial accounts)
- The obsession with measurement started with the right places, and progressively **invaded the wrong ones**
- Now the problem is that such measurement started to be applied to elements that have a **high measurement error** — in some cases infinitely high (recall Fukushima)
- Errors from **Mediocristan** are inconsequential; those from **Extremistan** are acute — when measurement errors are prohibitively large, we should not be using the word "measure"
- Clearly one can "measure" the table on which he writes, and "measure" the temperature — but one cannot "measure" future risks, nor can one "measure" probability — unlike a table, it cannot lend itself to investigation; this is at best a speculative estimation of something that *can* happen
- Note that **Hacking (2006)** does not for a single second consider fat tails! Same with **Hald (1998, 2003)**, **von Plato (1994)**, **Salsburg (2001)**, and from one who should know better, **Stigler (1990)**
- A book that promoted bad risk models: **Bernstein (1996)**. **Daston (1988)** links probabilistic measurement to the Enlightenment
- The idea of probability as a quantitative (not qualitative) construct has indeed been plaguing us — and the notion that science *equals* measurement free of error (it is, largely but not in everything) can lead us to all manner of fictions, delusions, and dreams
- An excellent understanding of probability linked to skepticism: **Franklin (2001)** — few other philosophers go back to the real problem of probability

### Anecdotal Knowledge and Power of Evidence

- A reader, **Karl Schluze**, wrote: "An old teacher and colleague told me (between his sips of bourbon) 'If you cut off the head of a dog and it barks, you don't have to repeat the experiment'"
- Easy to get examples: no lawyer would invoke an "N=1" argument in defense of a person, saying "he only killed once"; nobody considers a plane crash as "anecdotal"
- Taleb would go further and map **disconfirmation** as exactly where **N=1 is sufficient**
- Sometimes researchers call a result "anecdotal" as a knee-jerk reaction when the result is exactly the reverse — **Steven Pinker** called **John Gray's** pointing out the two world wars as counterevidence to his story of great moderation "anecdotal"
- Taleb's experience is that social science people rarely know what they are talking about when they talk about "evidence"

## BOOK V: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear

### Formal Definition of Fragility

- More formally, to complement graphical exposition, from **Taleb and Douady (2012)**, local fragility of random variable *Xλ* depending on parameter λ, at stress level *K* and semi-deviation level *s⁻(λ)* with pdf *f*_λ is its **K-left-tailed semi-vega sensitivity** ("vega" being sensitivity to some measure of volatility), *V(X, fλ, K, s⁻)* to *s⁻*, mean absolute semi-deviation below Ω
- Mathematical formulas presented for semi-deviation and fragility calculations involving integrals and partial derivatives
- **Inherited fragility** of *Y* with respect to *X* at stress level *L = φ(K)* and left-semi-deviation level *s⁻(λ)* of *X* is partial derivative
- Note that stress level and pdf are defined for variable *Y*, but parameter used for differentiation is left-semi-absolute deviation of *X*
- For antifragility, flip above Ω, in addition to robustness below same stress level *K*
- **Transfer theorems** relate fragility of *Y* to second derivative *φ(K)* and show effect of convex (concave or mixed nonlinear) transformations on tails via **transfer function** *H*^K. For antifragile, use *s*⁺, integral above *K*

### Fragility is Not Psychological

- Start from definition of fragility as tail vega sensitivity and end up with nonlinearity as necessary attribute of source of such fragility in inherited case—cause of disease rather than disease itself
- However, long literature by economists and decision scientists embedding risk into psychological preferences—historically, risk has been described as derived from risk aversion as result of structure of choices under uncertainty with concavity of muddled concept of "utility" of payoff; see **Pratt (1964)**, **Arrow (1965)**, **Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970, 1971)**
- But this "utility" business never led anywhere except circularity, expressed by **Machina and Rothschild (2008)**: "risk is what risk-averters hate." Indeed limiting risk to aversion to concavity of choices is quite unhappy result

### The Porcelain Cup and Its Concavity

- Clearly, coffee cup, house, or bridge doesn't have psychological preferences, subjective utility, etc. Yet each is concave in its reaction to harm
- Simply, taking *z* as stress level and Π(*z*) the harm function, it suffices to see that, with *n*>1, Π(*n z*) < *n* Π(*z*) for all 0< *n z*<*Z**, where *Z** is level (not necessarily) at which item is broken
- Such inequality leads to Π(*z*) having negative second derivative at initial value *z*. So if coffee cup is less harmed by *n* times stressor of intensity *Z* than once a stressor of *n Z*, then harm (as negative function) needs to be concave to stressors up to point of breaking
- Such stricture is imposed by structure of survival probabilities and distribution of harmful events, nothing to do with subjective utility or some other figments

### Fannie Mae

- They were concave across all meaningful variables. Some probability-and-nonlinearity-challenged fellow in Obama commission investigating cause of crisis spread rumor that author only detected interest rate risk of Fannie Mae: not true

### Costs of Execution

- **"Price impact,"** that is, execution costs, increase with size; they tend to follow square root—meaning total price is convex and grows at exponent 3/2 (meaning costs are concave)
- But problem is that for large deviations, such as Société Générale case, it is lot worse; transaction costs accelerate, in less and less precise manner—all these papers on price impact by financial research tradition are meaningless when you need them
- Remarkably, **Bent Flyvbjerg** found similar effect, but slightly less concave in total, for bridges and tunnels with proportional costs growing at 10 Log[*x*] of size

### Small Is Beautiful, Technical Approach

- To explain how city-states, small firms, etc. are more robust to harmful events, take *X*, random variable for "unintended exposure," source of uncertainty (for Soc Gen it was position that it did not see, for corporation it might be emergency need to some inventory, etc.)
- Assume size of this unintended harm is proportional to size of unit—for smaller entities engage in smaller transactions than larger ones. We use for probability distribution the variable of all unintended exposures Σ*X*ᵢ where *X*ᵢ are independent random variables, simply scaled as *X*ᵢ= *X/N*
- With *k* the tail amplitude and α the tail exponent, π(*k*, α, *X*) = α *k*^α *x*^(-1-α). The *N*-convoluted Pareto distribution for unintended total position *N* Σ *X*ᵢ; π(*k/N*, α, *X*)_N where *N* is number of convolutions for distribution. Mean of distribution, invariant with respect to *N*, is α *k*/(*α*–1)

### Losses from Squeezes and Overruns

- For loss function, take C[*X*]= -*b X*^β, where costs of harm is concave function of *X*. Note that for small deviations, β = 3/2 in microstructure and execution literature

### Resulting Probability Distribution of Harm

- As we are interested in distribution of *y*, we make transformation of stochastic variable. Harm *y*=C[*X*] has for distribution: π[*C*^(-1)[*x*]]/*C*'[*C*^(-1)[*x*]]
- Consider that it follows Pareto distribution with tail amplitude *k*^β and tail exponent α/β, *k*^β α which has for mean α−β
- Now the sum: for convoluted sum of *N* entities, asymptotic distribution becomes formulas with mean (owing to additivity) as function of variables which include *N*
- Formulas comparing ratio of expected losses in tails for *N*=1 to *N*=10 at different values of ratio of β over α, ratio of expectation for 1 unit over 10 units *M*(α = 3,β/α,*k*,*N* = 1) versus *M*(α = 3,β/α,*k*,*N* =10) reveals "small is beautiful" effect across different levels of concavity

### The Mosaic God Is Not Antifragile

- For God—**Abrahamic-Mosaic God** (of Jews, Christians, and Moslems)—is representation of total robustness and infallibility. Note that counter to initial impressions, essence of perfection is robustness, not antifragility
- Author received many messages suggesting that (Levantine) God should be put in antifragile category. This would be severe mistake according to Eastern Mediterranean religions. Antifragility for deity may apply to Babylonian, Greek, Syrian and Egyptian mythologies
- But **Levantine monotheistic theology**, from ancient Semitic El (or Al) to modern Allah or, to lesser extent, what people call "the Lord" in Bible Belt, from Genesis to Koran, progressed into definition of increasingly abstract God—hence closest to definition of pure robustness
- Monotheistic God is certainly not fragile; but he is not antifragile. By definition, thanks to his maximally abstract quality, he is what cannot be improved, which is very property of perfection—only imperfect mortals can improve, therefore need antifragility to try to improve
- In Koran, one of properties of God is **Smd**, word that has no synonym even in Arabic, hence cannot be translated; its meaning can only be conveyed through iteration of partial descriptions. *Smd* is that which has reached such degree of completeness that it does not depend on external circumstances, anything or anyone; bulwark against all manner of attacks; He transcends notion of time
- Idea is also present in other Levantine systems. **Orthodox theology**, through *theosis*, seeks merger with God, aspiration to level of completeness, hence independence from anything else

## Less Is More in Decision Theory

### Simplicity and Steve Jobs

> "That's been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in end because once you get there, you can move mountains." *BusinessWeek*, May 25, 1998

### Heuristics as Powerful—and Necessary—Shortcuts

- **Gigerenzer and Brighton (2009)** bust following myth, as presented in *The Selfish Gene* by **Richard Dawkins**, in which we find following about how baseball outfielder catches ball: "[H]e behaves as if he had solved set of differential equations in predicting trajectory of ball.… At some subconscious level, something functionally equivalent to mathematical calculations is going on."
- Not quite, Professor Dawkins. **Gerd Gigerenzer** et al. counter by saying that none of that is done. They write following:

> Instead, experiments have shown that players rely on several heuristics. Gaze heuristic is simplest one and works if ball is already high up in air: Fix your gaze on ball, start running, and adjust your running speed so that angle of gaze remains constant. Player who relies on gaze heuristic can ignore all causal variables necessary to compute trajectory of ball—initial distance, velocity, angle, air resistance, speed and direction of wind, and spin, among others. By paying attention to only one variable, player will end up where ball comes down without computing exact spot.

- Same heuristic is also used by animal species for catching prey and for intercepting potential mates. In pursuit and predation, bats, birds, and dragonflies maintain constant optical angle between themselves and their prey, as do dogs when catching Frisbee

Additional examples from peahen mate selection and ant nest measurement demonstrate how simple heuristics produce remarkably precise results without complex calculations.

## Lindy Effects and Associated Topics

### The Lindy Effect

- Demonstrated in **Mandelbrot (1997)**. Initially he used it for artistic production, bounded by life of producer. In author's conversations toward end of his life, suggested boundary perishable/nonperishable and agreed that nonperishable would be powerlaw distributed while perishable (initial Lindy story) worked as mere metaphor
- Depending on whether we condition for knowledge of initial time, remaining lifetime for exponential remains constant regardless of future condition, for powerlaw increases with time since inception, by factor of (α/1-α), where α is tail exponent; for Gaussian or semi-Gaussian it decreases

### Gott

- **Gott (1993, 1994)** presented Copernican idea but did not properly condition probability; corrected in **Caves (2000)**. See discussion in **Rees (2003)**, treatment of paradox in **Bostrom (2002)**

### Survival Papers and Distributional Properties

- Often powerlaws are mistaken for exponential distributions, owing to lack of data in tails. So author assumes a priori that exponential is likely to be powerlaw, but not reverse, as error in opposite direction is vastly less likely
- **Pigolotti et al. (2005)**. For empires, **Arbesman (2011)**. **Klinknadze et al. (2007, 2010)**, **Taagepera (1978, 1979)**. For firms: **Fujiwara**. Also **Turchin (2003, 2009)**

#### Luxury Goods and Optionality
- **Figure 39**: On vertical axis probability, on horizontal axis integral of wealth. **Antifragility city**: effect of change in inequality on pool of very rich increases nonlinearly in tails. French economy reacts to inequality more than total wealth in world. Their share of wealth multiplies by close to 50 times in response to change of 25% in dispersion of wealth. Small change of 0.01 in GINI coefficient (0 when perfect inequality, 1.00 when one person has all) equivalent to 8% rise in real Gross Domestic Product—effect is stark regardless of probability distribution

#### "Lecturing Birds How to Fly"

- Antecedents in **Erasmus**: "teaching fish how to swim." *Adages*, 2519, III, VI, 19. "*Piscem natare doces*" I'γθυν διδάσκεις, "*id est piscem nature doces. Perinde est ac si dicas : Doctum doces. Confine illi, quod alibi retulimus* : Δελφίνα νήχεσθαι διδάσκεις, *id est Delphinum natare doces.*"
- Expression first coined in **Haug and Taleb (2010)**, posted in 2006, leading to book **Triana (2009)**
- Author wasn't aware of Erasmus imagery, which would have been selected instead

#### Epistemic Base and Knowledge Types

- **Epistemic base and conflations**: Epistemic base is sort of *x*, not *f(x)*. Great way to see difference between *x* and *f(x)* in technology, offered by **Michael Polanyi**: one can patent *f(x)*, a technique, but not *x*, scientific knowledge. In Mokyr (2005)
- **Epistemic Base**: Mokyr (1999, 2002, 2005, 2009). Biggest problem with Mokyr: not getting ω_C. Further, this notion of East missing trial and error (also see argument about China): see **Tetlock** in Tetlock et al. (2009). **Mokyr and Meisenzahl** have different spin, with microinventions feeding macroinventions. Still intellectually weak

#### Linear Model of Innovation

- **Linear Model**: Edgerton (1996a, 1996b, 2004). Edgerton showed it was backward-fit idea, that is, fit to past. Edgerton also writes: "This profoundly academic-research-oriented model of twentieth-century science is all the more surprising in view of long tradition of *stressing the non-academic origins of modern science* [emphasis mine], particularly craft traditions, and insistence of much history of science, strengthened in last 20 years, on significance of industrial contexts for science, from dyeing to brewing to engine making."

#### Convexity Bias in Finance

- **Convexity bias**: Discovered early in commodity and financial futures; Burghardt and Hoskins (1994), Taleb (1997), Burghardt and Liu (2002), Burghardt and Panos (2001), Kirikos and Novak (1997), Pieterbarg and Renedo (2004). Many people blew up on misunderstanding the effect

#### Detection and Mapping of Convexity Bias (ω_X)

- **Example of detection and mapping of convexity bias (ω_X), from author's doctoral thesis**: Method is to find what needs dynamic hedging and dynamic revisions. Among members of class of instruments considered that are not options *stricto-sensu* but require dynamic hedging can be rapidly mentioned broad class of convex instruments:
  - (1) **Low coupon long dated bonds**: Assume discrete time framework. Take *B(r,T,C)* the bond maturing period *T*, paying coupon *C* where *rt = ∫rs ds*. We have the convexity ∂²*B*/∂*r*² increasing with *T* and decreasing with *C*
  - (2) **Contracts where financing is extremely correlated with price of Future**: (3) Baskets with geometric feature in its computation
  - (4) Largely neglected class of assets: **"quanto-defined" contracts** (in which payoff is not in native currency of contract), such as Japanese NIKEI Future where payoff is in U.S. currency. In short, while Japanese yen denominated NIKEI contract is linear, U.S. dollars denominated one is nonlinear and requires dynamic hedging

- Take at initial time *t*₀, final condition *V(S,T) = S*_T where *T* is expiration date. More simply, security just described is plain forward, assumed to be linear. There appears to be no Ito term there yet. However should there be intermediate payoff such that, having accounting period *i/T*, variation margin is paid in cash disbursement, some complexity would arise
- Assume Δ(*t*ᵢ) changes in value of portfolio during period (*t*ᵢ,*t*ᵢ₋₁), Δ(*t*ᵢ)= (*V*(*S*,*t*ᵢ)-*V*(*S*, *t*ᵢ₋₁)). If variation margin is to be paid at period *t*₀ then operator would have to borrow at forward rate between periods *t*ᵢ and *T*, here *r*(*t*ᵢ,*T*). This financing is necessary to make *V(S,T)* and *S*_T comparable in present value
- In expectation, we will have to discount variation using forward cash flow method for accounting period between *t*ᵢ₋₁ and *t*ᵢ. Seen from period *T*, value of variation becomes *E*₁ [*exp*[-*r*(*t*ᵢ,*T*)(*T*-*t*ᵢ)] Δ(*t*ᵢ)], where *E*₁ is expectation operator at time *t* (under, say, risk-neutral probability measure)
- Therefore delivering at period *T*, in expectation, as seen from period *t*₀, expected value of stream of future variation *E*₁₀[Σ *exp*[-*r*(*t*ᵢ,*T*)(*T*-*t*ᵢ)] Δ(*t*ᵢ)]
- However need to discount to present using term rate *r(T)*. Previous equation becomes *V(S,T)*|ₜ₌ₜ₀= *V[s,t*₀]+ *exp[r(T)] E*ₜ₀ [Σ *exp*[-*r*(*t*ᵢ,*T*)(*T*-*t*ᵢ)] Δ(*t*ᵢ)], which will be different from *S*_T when any of interest rate forwards is stochastic
- **Result** (polite way to say "theorem"): *When the variances of the forward discount rate r(t*ᵢ,*T) and the underlying security S*_T *are strictly positive and the correlation between the two is lower than 1, V(S,T)*|ₜ₌ₜ₀ ≠ *S*_T. Proof: by examining properties of expectation operator. Therefore: *F(S, t*₀) = *F(S,t*₀+Δ*t)*, while nonlinear instrument will merely satisfy: *E[V(S,t*₀)]= *E[V(S,t*₀+Δ*t)]*
