### Twelve Thousand Years

- We started with the example of Switzerland; now Taleb moves farther east to the **northern Levant** — roughly today's northern part of Syria and Lebanon
- The northern Levant stayed perhaps the **most prosperous province in the history of mankind** over a very long stretch of time, from the pre-pottery Neolithic until the middle of the twentieth century — **twelve thousand years** of continuity
- Compared to say, England (prosperous about five hundred years) or Scandinavia (less than three hundred years) — few areas on the planet have thrived with so much continuity over such a protracted stretch of time, what historians call **longue durée**
- Other cities came and went; Aleppo, Emesa (today Homs), and Laodicea (Lattakia) stayed relatively affluent
- The northern Levant was dominated by **traders**, largely owing to its position as a central spot on the **Silk Road**, and by agricultural lords supplying wheat to the Mediterranean world, particularly Rome
- The area supplied a few Roman emperors, a few Catholic popes before the schisms, and more than thirty **Greek language writers and philosophers** (including many heads of Plato's academy), in addition to the ancestors of **Steve Jobs**
- During Roman days the province was managed by **local elites** through a decentralized method of ruling that the Ottoman retained — cities minted their own coins
- After the Great War, one part of the northern Levant was integrated into the newly created nation of **Syria**, separated from its other section, now part of **Lebanon**
- The Ottoman type of imperial peace, the **pax Ottomana**, like its predecessor the **pax Romana**, was good for commerce — contracts were enforced, and that is what governments are needed for the most
- **Philip Mansel's** *Levant* documents how the cities of the Eastern Mediterranean operated as **city-states separated from the hinterland**
- A few decades into the life of Syria, the modernist **Baath Party** came to enforce utopias — as soon as the Baathists centralized the place and enforced their statist laws, Aleppo and Emesa went into **instant decline**
- The Baath Party's "modernization" program was to **remove the archaic mess of the souks** and replace them with the crisp modernism of the office building
- The effect was immediately visible: overnight the **trading families moved** to New York and New Jersey (for the Jews), California (for the Armenians), and Beirut (for the Christians)
- Beirut offered a commerce-friendly atmosphere, and **Lebanon was a benign, smaller, disorganized state** without any real central government — small enough to be a municipality on its own, smaller than a medium-size metropolitan area

### War, Prison, or Both

- While Lebanon had the right qualities, the state was **too loose** — by allowing Palestinian factions and Christian militias to own weapons, it caused an arms race between communities
- **Disorganized is invigorating; but the Lebanese state was one step too disorganized** — it would be like allowing New York mafia bosses to have a larger army than the Joint Chiefs of Staff (just imagine John Gotti with missiles)
- So in **1975** a raging civil war started in Lebanon
- A wealthy Aleppine merchant who fled the Baath regime, when asked by Taleb's grandfather why he did not return to Aleppo during the Lebanese war, answered categorically: **"We people of Aleppo prefer war to prison"** — by "prison" he meant the loss of political and economic freedoms
- Economic life, too, seems to prefer war to prison — Lebanon and Northern Syria had very similar wealth per individual about a century ago, identical cultures, languages, ethnicities, food, and even jokes
- Everything was the same except for the rule of the "modernizing" Baath Party in Syria compared to the totally benign state in Lebanon — in spite of a civil war that decimated the population, causing brain drain and setting wealth back by decades, today **Lebanon has a considerably higher standard of living — between three and six times the wealth of Syria**
- **Machiavelli** did not escape the point — Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, citing Machiavelli:

> "It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [and] its citizens infused with virtues.… A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn't peace, but freedom."

### Pax Romana

- The **centralized nation-state** is not exactly new in history — it existed in a nearly identical form in ancient Egypt, but it was an isolated event and did not survive for long; the Egyptian high state started collapsing upon contact with barbaric disorganized harassing invaders from Asia Minor with their assault chariots — literally a killer app
- The dynasties of ancient Egypt did not run the place like an empire but like an **integrated state** — markedly different, as it produces different types of variations
- **Nation-states rely on centralized bureaucracy**; whereas empires like the Roman and Ottoman dynasties relied on local elites, allowing city-states to prosper and conserve effective **commercial autonomy**
- The Ottomans did vassals and suzerains a favor by preventing them from involvement in warfare — this took away militaristic temptations and helped them thrive, allowing locals to focus on commerce rather than war
- **David Hume** in his *History of England* argued in favor of small states, as large states get tempted by warfare
- Neither Romans nor Ottomans allowed local autonomy out of love of freedom — they did it for **convenience**. A combination of empire (for some affairs) and semi-independent regions (left alone for business) provides more stability than the centralized nation-state with flags and discrete borders
- Centralized states (Egypt, China) were in practice not too different except for the **centralization of intellect** with the scribes and the mandarinate system establishing a **monopoly of knowledge**
- Before modernity's communication networks (telegraph, train, telephone), a local provincial ruler was king for a large number of matters even though nominally subordinate — until recent history, the central state represented about **5 percent of the economy**, compared to about ten times that share in modern Europe
- Governments were sufficiently distracted by war to **leave economic affairs to businessmen**

### War or No War

- Before the nation-states of Germany and Italy ("re-unification"), Europe was a **fissiparous and amorphous mass** of small statelings and city-states in constant tension but shifting alliances
- Something comforting about statelings at war: mediocrity cannot handle more than one enemy, so war turns into an alliance — tension was always present somewhere but **without large consequences**, like mild rain and no floods, like precipitation in the British Isles. **Mediocristan**
- The contagious creation of nation-states in the late nineteenth century led to the two world wars and their sequels: **more than sixty million (and possibly eighty million) victims**
- The difference between war and *no war* became huge, with marked discontinuity — a switch to **"winner take all"** effects, the domination of rare events
- A collection of statelings is similar to the restaurant business: volatile, but you never have a generalized restaurant crisis, unlike the banking business — because it is composed of **independent and competing small units** that do not individually threaten the system. **Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated**
- Some people have fallen for the naive turkey-style belief that the world is getting safer and safer — they naively attribute safety to the holy "state" (though bottom-up Switzerland has about the lowest rate of violence)
- It is exactly like saying that **nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often** — the world is subjected to fewer and fewer acts of violence, while wars have the potential to be more criminal
- We were very close to the **mother of all catastrophes in the 1960s** when the United States was about to pull the nuclear trigger on the Soviet Union — very close
- In **Extremistan**, we don't look at evidence (evidence comes too late), we look at **potential damage** — never has the world been more prone to more damage; never. Risk is in the future, not in the past
- The messy multi-ethnic **Austro-Hungarian Empire** vanished after the Great War, along with its Ottoman neighbor and rival (and, to a large extent, sibling — don't tell them), replaced with crisp, clean nation-states
- The Ottoman Empire (what was left of it) became the state of **Turkey, modeled after Switzerland**, with nobody noticing the inconsistency
- **Vienna** became trapped in Austria, sharing very little outside the formal language — like moving New York City to central Texas and still calling it New York
- **Stefan Zweig**, the Viennese Jewish novelist then considered the most influential author in the world, expressed his pain in his poignant memoir *The World of Yesterday*
- Vienna joined the league of multicultural cities such as Alexandria, Aleppo, Prague, Thessaloniki, Constantinople (now Istanbul), Smyrna, and Trieste, now squeezed into the **Procrustean bed of the nation-state**, with citizens left in the grip of intergenerational nostalgia
- Unable to handle the loss and integrate elsewhere, Zweig later **committed suicide in Brazil** — Taleb first read his account while in a similar situation of physical and cultural exile when his Levantine Christian world was shattered by the Lebanese war

### Chapter 5 Footnotes (Key Points)

- A collection of small units with **semi-independent variations** produces vastly different risk characteristics than a single large unit (Henri Pirenne, Max Weber)
- It is distressing to hear debates that make comparisons between countries when the size of the entities is not the same — say, comparing Singapore to Malaysia. **The size of the unit may matter more than the system**
- The **European Union** is legally protected from overcentralization thanks to the **principle of subsidiarity**: things should be handled by the smallest possible unit that can manage them with efficacy — inherited from the Catholic Church. Philosophically, a unit doesn't need to be very large (the state) nor very small (the individual), but somewhere in between
- When randomness gets distributed across a large number of small units with small recurrent political disorder, we get **Mediocristan**; when randomness concentrates, we get **Extremistan**
- People invoke "Balkanization" about the mess of fragmented states, as if fragmentation was a bad thing and as if there was an alternative in the Balkans — but nobody uses **"Helvetization"** to describe its successes
- **Steven Pinker** misread the nature of the statistical process — a war that would decimate the planet would be completely consistent with the statistics, and would not even be an "outlier"; **Ben Bernanke** was similarly fooled with his *Great Moderation*, a turkey problem; one can be confused by the properties of any process with compressed volatility from the top

## Chapter 6: Tell Them I Love (Some) Randomness

*Maxwell in Extremistan — Complicated mechanisms to feed a donkey — Virgil said to do it, and do it now*

### Tight Controls Cause Blowups (Maxwell's Governors)

- The point of the previous chapter was that the **risk properties of the fragile bank employee are vastly different from those of the comparatively antifragile artisan taxi driver** — likewise, the risk characteristic of a centralized system is different from that of a messy municipally-led confederation
- The second type is stable in the long run **because of** *some* dose of volatility
- A scientific argument showing how tight controls backfire and cause blowups was made by **James Clerk Maxwell** of electromagnetic theory fame
- **"Governors"** are contraptions meant to control the speed of steam engines by compensating for abrupt variations — they aimed at stabilizing engines, and apparently did, but paradoxically sometimes brought **capricious behavior and crashes**
- **Light control works; close control leads to overreaction**, sometimes causing the machinery to break into pieces
- In a famous paper **"On Governors"** (1867), Maxwell modeled the behavior and showed mathematically that **tightly controlling the speed of engines leads to instability**
- Maxwell's derivations can be generalized across domains to debunk **pseudo-stabilization and hidden long-term fragility**
- In markets, fixing prices or eliminating speculators (the so-called "noise traders") and the moderate volatility they bring — provides an **illusion of stability**, with periods of calm punctuated with large jumps
- Because players are unused to volatility, the slightest price variation will be attributed to insider information or changes in the state of the system, causing **panics**
- When a currency never varies, a slight, very slight move makes people believe the world is ending — **injecting some confusion stabilizes the system**

### The Predictable Person

- Confusing people a little bit is beneficial — imagine someone extremely punctual and predictable who comes home at exactly six o'clock every day for fifteen years; you can use his arrival to set your watch. He will cause his family anxiety if he is **barely a few minutes late**
- Someone with a slightly more volatile — hence unpredictable — schedule (with, say, a half-hour variation) won't cause such alarm

### Variations as Purges

- **Small forest fires** periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material, so it does not have the opportunity to accumulate — systematically preventing forest fires from taking place **"to be safe" makes the big one much worse**
- For similar reasons, **stability is not good for the economy**: firms become very weak during long periods of steady prosperity devoid of setbacks, and hidden vulnerabilities accumulate silently under the surface — so delaying crises is not a very good idea
- Absence of fluctuations in the market causes hidden risks to accumulate with impunity — the longer one goes without a market trauma, **the worse the damage when commotion occurs**
- Seasoned trading veterans used a heuristic: when a market reaches a **"new low"** (a level not seen in a long time), there is "a lot of blood" to come, with people rushing to the exit — people unused to losing shekels will be experiencing a large loss and will incur great distress
- If such a low market level has not been seen in years, say two years, it will be called "a two-year low" and will cause **more damage than a one-year low** — tellingly, traders call it a "cleanup," getting the "weak hands" out of the way
- A **"weak hand"** is clearly someone who is fragile but doesn't know it and is lulled by a false sense of security — when many weak hands rush to the door, they collectively cause crashes
- A **volatile market** doesn't let people go such a long time without a "cleanup" of risks, thereby preventing such market collapses

> *Fluctuat nec mergitur* (fluctuates, or floats, but does not sink) — Latin saying

### Hungry Donkeys

- So far we have argued that preventing randomness in an antifragile system is not always a good idea — now consider the situation in which **adding randomness** has been a standard operating method, as the needed fuel for an antifragile system permanently hungry for it
- **Buridan's Donkey**: A donkey equally famished and thirsty, caught at an equal distance between food and water, would unavoidably die of hunger or thirst — but he can be saved by a **random nudge** one way or the other
- Named after the medieval philosopher **Jean de Buridan** — when some systems are stuck in a dangerous impasse, **randomness and only randomness can unlock them and set them free**. Absence of randomness equals guaranteed death
- **Stochastic resonance**: adding random noise to the background makes you hear sounds (say, music) with **more accuracy** — the psychological effect of overcompensation helps us get signals in the midst of noise; here it is not psychological but a physical property of the system
- Weak SOS signals, too weak to be picked up by remote receptors, can become audible in the presence of background noise and random interference — by adding random hiss to the signal, it rises above the threshold of detection to become audible. **Nothing in that situation does better than randomness, which comes for free**
- **Annealing** in metallurgy: a technique to make metal stronger and more homogeneous through the heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of the crystals and reduce their defects — just as with Buridan's donkey, the heat causes atoms to become unstuck from initial positions and wander randomly through states of higher energy; the cooling gives them more chances of finding new, **better configurations**
- Taleb's father would tap a wooden **barometer** every day upon coming home — the stress got the needle unstuck and allowed it to find its true equilibrium position. That's a local brand of antifragility
- Inspired by the metallurgical technique, mathematicians use **simulated annealing** — a computer simulation method to bring more general optimal solutions to problems and situations, solutions that only randomness can deliver
- **Nathan Myhrvold** brought to Taleb's attention a controversial 1975 paper in *Science* showing that **random drilling was superior to whatever search method** was being employed at the time
- Ironically, the so-called **chaotic systems** (those experiencing a brand of variations called *chaos*) can be **stabilized by adding randomness** to them — a doctoral student demonstrated the effects: balls jumping chaotically on a table in response to steady vibrations; these steady shocks made the balls jump in a jumbled and inelegant manner. Then, as by magic, he moved a switch and the jumps became orderly and smooth. The change from chaos to order did not take place by removing chaos, **but by adding random, completely random but low-intensity shocks**

### Political Annealing

- It has been hard to explain to real people that stressors and uncertainty have their role in life — even harder to explain to **politicians**, yet this is where a certain dose of randomness is needed the most
- A film script about a city completely ruled by randomness (very Borgesian): at set intervals, the ruler randomly assigns the denizens a new role in the city — the butcher becomes a baker, and the baker a prisoner, etc. People end up rebelling, asking for stability as their inalienable right
- Taleb's counter-proposal: instead of having rulers randomize the jobs of citizens, we should have **citizens randomize the jobs of rulers** — naming them by raffles and removing them at random as well. Similar to simulated annealing, and it happens to be no less effective
- The ancients were aware of it: members of the **Athenian assemblies were chosen by lot**, a method meant to protect the system from degeneracy
- In a computer simulation, **Alessandro Pluchino** and colleagues showed how adding a certain number of **randomly selected politicians** to the process can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system
- Sometimes the system benefits from a different type of stressor — for **Voltaire**, the best form of government was the one tempered with political assassination. Regicide is the equivalent of tapping on the barometer to make it work better, creating some **often-needed reshuffling** that would never have been done voluntarily
- The void created at the top allows the **annealing effect**, causing a new leader to emerge — the secular drop in premature deaths in society has deprived us of a naturalistic managerial turnover
- Murder is the standard procedure for succession in the mafia (the last publicized annealing was when **John Gotti** murdered his predecessor in front of a New York steakhouse to become the capo of the family) — outside the mafia, bosses and board members now stay longer, impeding many domains: CEOs, tenured academics, politicians, journalists — we need to **offset this condition with random lotteries**
- You cannot randomize a political party out of existence — the problem in the United States is not the two-party system, but being stuck with the **same two parties** that don't have organic built-in expiration dates
- The ancients perfected the method of random draw and integrated it into **divinations** — these draws were really meant to pick a random exit without having to make a decision, so one would not have to live with the burden of the consequences later
- One of the methods, called **sortes virgilianae** (fate as decided by the epic poet Virgil), involved opening Virgil's *Aeneid* at random and interpreting the line that presented itself as direction for the course of action
- Taleb practices such randomizing heuristic in restaurants to avoid the **tyranny of choice** — blindly duplicating the selection of the most overweight male at the table; when no such person is present, randomly picking from the menu without reading the name of the item, under the peace of mind that Baal made the choice for him

### That Time Bomb Called Stability

- Absence of fire lets highly flammable material accumulate — absence of political instability, even war, lets **explosive material and tendencies accumulate under the surface**

### The Second Step: Do (Small) Wars Save Lives?

- The anti-Enlightenment political philosopher **Joseph de Maistre** remarked that conflicts strengthen countries — this is highly debatable, and as the victim of a brutal civil war, Taleb can attest to its horrors
- But what is interesting and elegant in de Maistre's reasoning is his pointing out the mistake of **analyzing losses from a given event and ignoring the rest of the story** — people tend to spot the error of analyzing immediate gains without taking into account long-term side effects
- We look at casualties as losses without taking into account the second step, what happens later — **unlike gardeners, who understand rather well that pruning trees strengthens them**
- **Forced, constrained, non-natural peace** may be costly in lives — consider the great complacency that led to the Great War after almost a century of relative peace in Europe, coupled with the rise of the heavily armed nation-state
- We all love peace and economic and emotional stability — but do not want to be **suckers in the long term**. We seek vaccination at every new school year (injecting harm to build immunity) but fail to transfer the mechanism to political and economic domains

### What to Tell the Foreign Policy Makers

- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile — it is that, at the same time, **it exhibits no visible risks**. Volatility is information
- These systems tend to be too calm and exhibit **minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface**
- Although the stated intention of political leaders and economic policy makers is to stabilize the system by inhibiting fluctuations, **the result tends to be the opposite** — these artificially constrained systems become prone to **Black Swans**
- Such environments eventually experience massive blowups, catching everyone off guard and undoing years of stability — in almost all cases, ending up far worse than they were in their initial volatile state. **The longer it takes for the blowup to occur, the worse the resulting harm** to both economic and political systems
- Seeking stability by achieving stability (and forgetting the second step) has been a **great sucker game** for economic and foreign policies
- Take rotten governments like the one in **Egypt** before the riots of 2011, supported by the United States for four decades "to avoid chaos," with the side effect of a coterie of privileged pillagers using superpowers as a backstop — identical to bankers using "too big to fail" status to scam taxpayers and pay themselves high bonuses
- **Saudi Arabia** is the country that at present worries and offends Taleb the most — a standard case of top-down stability enforced by a superpower at the expense of every single possible moral and ethical metric, and of course, at the expense of stability itself
- A place "allied" to the United States is a total monarchy, devoid of a constitution — between seven and fifteen thousand members of the royal family run the place, leading a lavish, hedonistic lifestyle in open contradiction with the purist ideas that got them there
- Look at the contradiction: the stern desert tribes whose legitimacy is derived from Amish-like austerity can, thanks to a superpower, turn to **hedonistic uninhibited pleasure seeking** — the king openly travels for pleasure with a retinue that fills four Jumbo jets. The family amassed a fortune now largely in Western safes
- Without the United States, the country would have had its revolution, a regional breakup, some turmoil, then perhaps some stability — **but preventing noise makes the problem worse in the long run**
- The **"alliance"** between the Saudi royal family and the United States was meant to provide stability — but "how long" is irrelevant: this stability is similar to a loan one has to eventually pay back
- Few people are aware that the bitterness of Iranians toward the United States comes from the fact that the U.S. — a democracy — installed a monarch, the repressive **Shah of Iran**, who pillaged the place but gave the U.S. the "stability" of access to the Persian Gulf. The theocratic regime in Iran today is largely the result of such repression
- We need to learn to think in **second steps, chains of consequences, and side effects**
- U.S. policy toward the Middle East has historically, and especially since September 11, 2001, been unduly focused on the **repression of any and all political fluctuations** in the name of preventing "Islamic fundamentalism" — a trope that almost every regime has used
- Aside from the fact that killing Islamists compounds their numbers, the West and its autocratic Arab allies have **strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground**
- The more they intervene in other countries for the sake of stability, the more instability they bring (except for emergency-room-style cases) — or perhaps time to reduce the role of policy makers in policy affairs

> "One of life's packages: no stability without volatility."

### What Do We Call Here Modernity?

- Taleb's definition of **modernity**: humans' large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world's jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors
- Modernity corresponds to the systematic extraction of humans from their **randomness-laden ecology** — physical and social, even epistemological
- Modernity is not just the postmedieval, postagrarian, and postfeudal historical period as defined in sociology textbooks — it is rather the spirit of an age marked by **rationalization (naive rationalism)**, the idea that society is understandable, hence must be designed, by humans
- With it was born statistical theory, the bell curve, the notion of **"efficiency"** — or optimization
- **Modernity is a Procrustean bed** — good or bad — a reduction of humans to what appears to be efficient and useful. Some aspects of it work; Procrustean beds are not all negative reductions. Some may be beneficial, though these are rare
- Consider the life of the lion in the comfort and predictability of the **Bronx Zoo** (with Sunday afternoon visitors flocking to look at him in a combination of curiosity, awe, and pity) compared to that of his cousins in freedom — we once had free-range humans and free-range children before the advent of the golden period of the soccer mom
- We are moving into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization (or rather reinvention of new sacred values like flags to replace altars), the tax man, fear of the boss, spending the weekend in interesting places and the workweek in a putatively less interesting one, the separation of "work" and "leisure," the retirement plan, **smooth surfaces, and egocentric architects**
- **Violence is transferred from individuals to states. So is financial indiscipline.** At the center of all this is the denial of antifragility
- There is a dependence on narratives, an intellectualization of actions — public enterprises and functionaries (even employees of large corporations) can only do things that fit some narrative, unlike businesses that can just follow profits, with or without a good-sounding story
- Remember: **you need a name for the color blue when you build a narrative, but not in action** — the thinker lacking a word for "blue" is handicapped; not the doer. Taleb has had a hard time conveying to intellectuals the *intellectual* superiority of practice
- Modernity widened the difference between the sensational and the relevant — in a natural environment the sensational is, well, sensational for a reason; today we depend on the press for essentially human things as gossip and anecdotes, and we care about the private lives of people in very remote places
- In the past, when we were not fully aware of antifragility and self-organization and spontaneous healing, we managed to respect these properties by constructing beliefs that served the purpose of managing and surviving uncertainty — we imparted improvements to the agency of **god(s)**. We may have denied that things can take care of themselves without some agency, but it was the gods that were the agents, **not Harvard-educated captains of the ship**
- The emergence of the **nation-state** falls squarely into this progression — the transfer of agency to mere humans. The story of the nation-state is that of the **concentration and magnification of human errors**
- **Modernity starts with the state monopoly on violence, and ends with the state's monopoly on fiscal irresponsibility**
- Next will be discussed two central elements at the core of modernity: *primo*, in Chapter 7, naive interventionism with the costs associated with fixing things that one should leave alone; *secundo*, in Chapter 8 and as transition to Book III, this idea of replacing God and the gods with something even more religiously fundamentalist: the unconditional belief in the idea of **scientific prediction** regardless of the domain
