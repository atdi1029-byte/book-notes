<h2 id="takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="summary-section">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The 85 Percent Solution beats perfectionism every time.</strong> Getting 85% right is infinitely better than 0%. Most people never start investing because they&rsquo;re waiting for the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; moment. Just start.</li>
    <li><strong>Automate everything so you never have to think about money.</strong> Set up automatic transfers from your paycheck to 401(k), Roth IRA, savings, and bill payments. Once built, the system takes less than 90 minutes per month.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit cards are powerful tools, not traps.</strong> Pay in full every month, negotiate lower APRs, use rewards strategically, and never close your oldest card. The average user leaves $300+/year in rewards unclaimed.</li>
    <li><strong>Your credit score is the single most important number in personal finance.</strong> It affects mortgage rates, car loans, insurance, and even job applications. The difference between a 620 and 760 FICO on a $220,000 mortgage is $76,768 in extra interest.</li>
    <li><strong>Banks profit from your ignorance &mdash; choose no-fee, high-interest online accounts.</strong> Online banks offer no minimums, no fees, and interest rates 10-20x higher than traditional banks.</li>
    <li><strong>You don&rsquo;t need to pick stocks &mdash; buy low-cost index funds and hold forever.</strong> Over 75% of actively managed funds fail to beat the market. Index funds give you the entire market for 0.14% in fees vs. 1-2% for managed funds.</li>
    <li><strong>Asset allocation matters more than any individual investment.</strong> Over 90% of returns are determined by your mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. Use your age as a guide: subtract from 120 to get your stock percentage.</li>
    <li><strong>Conscious Spending: spend extravagantly on what you love, cut mercilessly on what you don&rsquo;t.</strong> Fixed costs 50-60%, investments 10%, savings 5-10%, guilt-free spending 20-35%.</li>
    <li><strong>Invisible scripts about money silently control your financial decisions.</strong> &ldquo;Renting is throwing money away,&rdquo; &ldquo;Credit cards are evil,&rdquo; &ldquo;The stock market is gambling&rdquo; &mdash; these beliefs cause more damage than any bad investment.</li>
    <li><strong>Negotiation is the fastest legal way to make money.</strong> A 10-minute salary negotiation can earn $5,000&ndash;$10,000. It&rsquo;s 90% mindset, 10% tactics.</li>
    <li><strong>Target date funds are the best &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; investment.</strong> One fund that auto-rebalances and gets more conservative as you age. Buy one fund and never think about it again.</li>
    <li><strong>The Ladder of Personal Finance gives you a clear priority order.</strong> 401(k) match &rarr; pay off credit card debt &rarr; Roth IRA &rarr; max 401(k) &rarr; HSA &rarr; taxable account.</li>
    <li><strong>Lump-sum investing beats dollar-cost averaging 2/3 of the time.</strong> Vanguard research: if you have money to invest, invest it now.</li>
    <li><strong>Real estate is the most overrated investment in America.</strong> Home prices increased only 0.6%/year (1915-2015). A $220,000 house costs $778,000+ over 30 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Your wedding will cost more than you think &mdash; start saving now.</strong> Average wedding: ~$35,000. Automate monthly contributions to a sub-savings account.</li>
    <li><strong>Compound interest is the most powerful force in personal finance.</strong> Starting at 25 vs. 35 with $200/month at 8%: $181,469 vs. $118,589 &mdash; a $62,880 penalty for waiting.</li>
    <li><strong>Earning more has no ceiling; cutting costs has a floor.</strong> A $2,000/year raise over 30 years is worth $100,000+. Focus on Big Wins.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are usually wrong and always expensive.</strong> 95% of fund managers can&rsquo;t beat the market; pundits&rsquo; predictions are worse than chance.</li>
    <li><strong>Review your finances annually.</strong> Renegotiate bills, check subscriptions, confirm max retirement contributions, review debt payoff, plan next year intentionally.</li>
    <li><strong>A Rich Life means something different to everyone &mdash; define yours.</strong> Automate finances, then design the life you actually want: relationships, experiences, giving back.</li>
  </ol>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- THEMATIC BREAKDOWNS -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h2 id="credit">Credit Optimization</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit score components:</strong> 35% payment history, 30% amounts owed, 15% length of history, 10% new credit, 10% credit mix</li>
  <li>Always pay in full monthly &mdash; carrying a balance costs you and does NOT improve your score</li>
  <li>Negotiate waived fees and lower APRs &mdash; companies will often say yes just to retain you</li>
  <li>Set up automatic payments to never miss a due date</li>
  <li>Never close your oldest card &mdash; it hurts your average account age</li>
  <li><strong>Debt payoff:</strong> Snowball Method (smallest balance first for psychological wins) or Avalanche Method (highest interest first for math wins)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="banking">Banking Strategy</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ideal setup:</strong> one no-fee checking (bill pay) + one high-yield savings (goals)</li>
  <li>Use sub-savings accounts for specific goals: vacation, emergency, car, wedding, down payment</li>
  <li>Negotiate or eliminate every bank fee &mdash; overdraft, monthly maintenance, minimum balance</li>
  <li>Online banks (Ally, Marcus, Capital One 360) offer rates 10-20x higher than traditional banks</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="investing">Investment Fundamentals</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>401(k):</strong> Always contribute enough to get the full employer match &mdash; it&rsquo;s a 100% return on your money</li>
  <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Post-tax contributions, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals &mdash; the best deal in investing</li>
  <li><strong>Asset allocation trumps individual picks:</strong> over 90% of returns depend on your stock/bond mix</li>
  <li><strong>Swensen&rsquo;s model portfolio:</strong> 30% domestic equities, 15% international, 5% emerging markets, 20% REITs, 15% government bonds, 15% TIPS</li>
  <li>Expense ratios matter: 0.14% vs. 1% over 25 years = tens of thousands of dollars difference</li>
  <li><strong>Rebalance once per year</strong> if managing your own portfolio (target date funds do this automatically)</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Ladder of Personal Finance</h4>
<ol>
  <li>401(k) match (free money &mdash; 100% return)</li>
  <li>Pay off credit card debt (high interest)</li>
  <li>Open and fund a Roth IRA</li>
  <li>Max out 401(k) contributions</li>
  <li>HSA if eligible (triple tax advantage)</li>
  <li>Taxable investment account for additional investing</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="spending">Conscious Spending</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not a budget (restrictive) &mdash; a <strong>Conscious Spending Plan</strong> (empowering)</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed costs:</strong> 50-60% (rent, utilities, debt payments, subscriptions)</li>
  <li><strong>Investments:</strong> 10% (401(k), Roth IRA)</li>
  <li><strong>Savings:</strong> 5-10% (emergency fund, goals like vacation, down payment)</li>
  <li><strong>Guilt-free spending:</strong> 20-35% (dining, entertainment, whatever you love)</li>
  <li>Build &ldquo;spending frameworks&rdquo; &mdash; decide in advance what you&rsquo;ll always spend on (e.g., books: always buy, don&rsquo;t debate)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="automation">The Automation System</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Money flow:</strong> Paycheck &rarr; 401(k) &rarr; Checking &rarr; Roth IRA + Savings + Bills + Guilt-free spending</li>
  <li>Set up on the 1st and 5th of each month</li>
  <li>Once built, takes ~90 minutes/month to maintain</li>
  <li>The system works whether you&rsquo;re paying attention or not</li>
  <li>Link all accounts: paycheck deposits to checking, automatic transfers to savings/investments on set dates</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bigticket">Big-Ticket Purchases</h2>
<h4>Cars</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Calculate <strong>total cost of ownership</strong> (not just sticker): insurance, gas, maintenance, parking</li>
  <li>Buy for 10+ years, not looks &mdash; optimize for reliability and resale value</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t lease &mdash; buying saves $4,597-$6,000+ over 5-6 years</li>
  <li><strong>Negotiation tactic:</strong> email 17 dealers the exact car you want, tell them you&rsquo;re buying in 2 weeks, go with the lowest price. Buy at year-end (quota season).</li>
  <li>Keep meticulous maintenance records &mdash; increases resale value</li>
</ul>
<h4>Houses</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real estate is a poor investment for most people</strong> &mdash; 0.6%/year returns (Robert Shiller, 1915-2015)</li>
  <li>Buy only if: 20% down, 30-year fixed rate, monthly payment &le; 30% of gross income, plan to stay 10+ years</li>
  <li>A $220,000 house costs <span class="key-number">$778,409</span> over 30 years (interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs)</li>
  <li>Higher FICO score saves massive money: 760-850 score pays $166,378 in interest vs. $243,146 for 620-639 score on same $220K loan</li>
  <li>Renting and investing the difference often beats buying</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="relationships">Money &amp; Relationships</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Normalize talking about money</strong> with your partner &mdash; attitude matters more than tactics</li>
  <li><strong>The Big Meeting:</strong> both partners lay bare all finances, discuss goals, set up shared systems (4-5 hours)</li>
  <li><strong>When one earns more:</strong> divide expenses proportionately, not 50/50 (Suze Orman&rsquo;s approach)</li>
  <li>Focus on &ldquo;the plan&rdquo; not &ldquo;the person&rdquo; when spending conflicts arise</li>
  <li><strong>Prenups:</strong> 99% of people don&rsquo;t need one. If you do (business, disproportionate assets, inheritance), lead with love, take personal responsibility, see a counselor if needed.</li>
  <li>Help parents gently &mdash; ask questions, listen, offer the 85% Solution</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t share exact dollar figures beyond your spouse &mdash; it changes relationships</li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- CONTRARIAN IDEAS -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h2 id="contrarian">Contrarian Ideas Worth Remembering</h2>
<div class="contrarian">
  <ol>
    <li>Getting a tax refund is actually great &mdash; the &ldquo;interest-free loan to the government&rdquo; argument ignores human behavior (you would have spent that money).</li>
    <li>You do NOT need to buy a used car &mdash; a new car driven 10+ years can save more than a used car replaced every 5.</li>
    <li>Renting is NOT throwing money away &mdash; a $220,000 house costs $778,000+ over 30 years. Renting and investing the difference often wins.</li>
    <li>You should NOT check your investments frequently &mdash; log in no more than once a month. Boring investing is profitable investing.</li>
    <li>Financial &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are usually wrong &mdash; 95% of mutual fund managers fail to beat a simple index fund.</li>
    <li>Budgets don&rsquo;t work for most people &mdash; Conscious Spending Plans do, because they focus on what you CAN spend guilt-free.</li>
    <li>Paying off student loans aggressively isn&rsquo;t always optimal &mdash; the hybrid 50/50 approach often wins because of compound interest and tax-advantaged accounts.</li>
    <li>The media&rsquo;s financial advice is designed for pageviews, not behavior change &mdash; estate tax affects 0.2% of people but gets endless airtime.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Average&rdquo; returns of 8% are actually extraordinary &mdash; people who fear being &ldquo;average&rdquo; trade frequently and perform WORSE.</li>
    <li>Having a prenup doesn&rsquo;t mean planning to fail &mdash; it means you plan for everything, which is what financially responsible people do.</li>
    <li>Leasing a car nearly always benefits the dealer &mdash; buying saves $4,597-$6,000+ over 5-6 years vs. leasing the same model.</li>
    <li>The stock market has handily outperformed real estate &mdash; yet Americans pour their wealth into houses while neglecting investment accounts.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- KEY PROPOSALS -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<h2 id="proposals">Sethi&rsquo;s Key Proposals</h2>
<div class="proposals">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Use the 85 Percent Solution for everything.</strong> Don&rsquo;t wait for perfection. Start now with 85% right and adjust later.</li>
    <li><strong>Build an Automatic Money Flow system.</strong> Set up transfers so money flows automatically to 401(k), Roth IRA, savings, bills, and spending.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow the Conscious Spending Plan, not a budget.</strong> Fixed costs 50-60%, investments 10%, savings 5-10%, guilt-free spending 20-35%.</li>
    <li><strong>Climb the Ladder of Personal Finance in order.</strong> 401(k) match &rarr; pay off debt &rarr; Roth IRA &rarr; max 401(k) &rarr; HSA &rarr; taxable accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Buy target date funds or a simple index fund portfolio.</strong> For 85%: one target date fund. For the ambitious: Swensen&rsquo;s 6-fund model.</li>
    <li><strong>Negotiate everything &mdash; especially salary and big-ticket purchases.</strong> Come prepared, have another offer, never reveal current salary.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk about money with the people you love.</strong> Have The Big Meeting. Help your parents. Don&rsquo;t let money be taboo.</li>
    <li><strong>Play offense, not defense.</strong> Focus on Big Wins: negotiate salary, automate investing, pick the right accounts. These 5-10 decisions have disproportionate results.</li>
    <li><strong>Give back.</strong> Once your system is running, elevate your goals. Donate money, time, or skills. Philanthropy mirrors the IWT principles: just start.</li>
  </ol>

<h2 id="notes">Detailed Chapter Notes</h2>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Introduction: Would You Rather Be Sexy or Rich?</h3>

<h4>Money and Food Parallel</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We don&rsquo;t track calories &rarr; we don&rsquo;t track spending</li>
  <li>We eat more than we know &rarr; we spend more than we realize</li>
  <li>99.99% of weight loss = eat less, exercise more. 99.99% of getting rich = spend less, earn more, invest the difference.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why Managing Money Is Hard</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Info Glut:</strong> Too much information leads to decision paralysis (Barry Schwartz). For every 10 funds added to a 401(k), participation drops 2%.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Sally vs. Dumb Dan:</strong> Sally invests $200/month starting at 25 for 10 years. Dan invests $200/month starting at 35 for 20 years. At 8%, Sally has $181,469 vs. Dan&rsquo;s $118,589.</li>
  <li><strong>The best time to start investing was 10 years ago. The second best time is today.</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>&ldquo;The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<h4>10 Rules for a Rich Life</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Spend extravagantly on things you love, cut mercilessly on things you don&rsquo;t</li>
  <li>Focus on Big Wins (5-10 things with disproportionate results)</li>
  <li>Investing should be boring and very profitable over the long term</li>
  <li>There&rsquo;s a limit to cutting costs, but no limit to earning</li>
  <li>Friends/family will have unsolicited &ldquo;tips&rdquo; &mdash; listen politely, stick to the program</li>
  <li>Build &ldquo;spending frameworks&rdquo; &mdash; decide in advance what you&rsquo;ll always spend on</li>
  <li>Beware searching for &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; tips &mdash; the basics done consistently ARE the advanced move</li>
  <li>You&rsquo;re in control. Nobody&rsquo;s coming to rescue you.</li>
  <li>Be willing to be unapologetically different with your Rich Life</li>
  <li>Live life outside the spreadsheet &mdash; automate, then focus on relationships and experiences</li>
</ol>

<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 1: Optimize Your Credit Cards</h3>

<h4>Credit Score Components</h4>
<table>
  <tr><th>Factor</th><th>Weight</th><th>What It Means</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Payment history</td><td><span class="key-number">35%</span></td><td>Pay every bill on time, every time</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Amounts owed</td><td><span class="key-number">30%</span></td><td>Keep utilization below 30% of available credit</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Length of history</td><td><span class="key-number">15%</span></td><td>Older accounts are better &mdash; never close your oldest card</td></tr>
  <tr><td>New credit</td><td>10%</td><td>Don&rsquo;t open many accounts at once</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Credit mix</td><td>10%</td><td>Having different types of credit helps</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>How to Beat Credit Card Companies</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Always pay in full each month</strong> &mdash; this is non-negotiable</li>
  <li>Call to negotiate: lower APR, waive annual fees, waive late fees</li>
  <li>Set up automatic payments so you never miss a due date</li>
  <li>Keep old cards open (helps credit age and utilization ratio)</li>
  <li>Use rewards strategically &mdash; cash back, travel miles, signup bonuses</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great customer, and I&rsquo;d like a lower APR. I&rsquo;ve been paying my bill in full and on time. I know a few other credit cards are offering me 0 percent introductory rates. Can you match that, or lower my APR?&rdquo;</blockquote>

<h4>Paying Off Credit Card Debt</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Snowball Method:</strong> Pay minimums on all cards, put extra money toward the card with the smallest balance first. Psychological wins keep you motivated.</li>
  <li><strong>Avalanche Method:</strong> Pay minimums on all cards, put extra money toward the card with the highest interest rate. Mathematically optimal.</li>
  <li>Negotiate lower APRs on all cards before starting payoff</li>
  <li>Consider balance transfer to a 0% introductory rate card</li>
</ul>

<!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 2: Beat Your Banks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Big banks make billions in fees from people who don&rsquo;t know better</li>
  <li><strong>Ideal setup:</strong> one no-fee high-interest checking + one high-yield savings</li>
  <li>Online savings accounts offer interest rates 10-20x higher than traditional banks</li>
  <li>Use sub-savings accounts for specific goals</li>
  <li>Negotiate ALL fees &mdash; or switch to a bank that doesn&rsquo;t charge them</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>&ldquo;If your bank is charging you monthly maintenance fees, you need to find a new bank. That&rsquo;s like your gym charging you a &lsquo;sweating fee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote>

<!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 3: Get Ready to Invest</h3>

<h4>401(k) Basics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-tax retirement account through your employer</li>
  <li><strong>Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match</strong> &mdash; it&rsquo;s an instant 100% return</li>
  <li>Money grows tax-deferred; you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement</li>
  <li>If your employer offers no match, go straight to a Roth IRA</li>
</ul>

<h4>Roth IRA Basics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Post-tax contributions, <strong>tax-free growth</strong>, tax-free withdrawals in retirement</li>
  <li>The best deal in investing for young people &mdash; you&rsquo;re likely in a lower tax bracket now</li>
  <li>Can withdraw contributions (not earnings) penalty-free at any time</li>
  <li>Open at Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Power of Compound Interest</h4>
<ul>
  <li>$100/month at 8% for 40 years = $349,100</li>
  <li>Starting 10 years earlier adds an extra $62,880 on just $200/month</li>
  <li><strong>Time in the market beats timing the market.</strong></li>
</ul>

<!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 4: Conscious Spending</h3>

<h4>The Conscious Spending Plan</h4>
<table>
  <tr><th>Category</th><th>% of Take-Home Pay</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Fixed Costs</strong></td><td>50-60%</td><td>Rent, utilities, debt payments, insurance, subscriptions</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Investments</strong></td><td>10%</td><td>401(k), Roth IRA</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Savings</strong></td><td>5-10%</td><td>Emergency fund, vacation, down payment, wedding</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Guilt-Free Spending</strong></td><td>20-35%</td><td>Dining out, clothes, entertainment, hobbies</td></tr>
</table>
<ul>
  <li>This isn&rsquo;t about restriction &mdash; it&rsquo;s about knowing exactly what you can spend on fun without guilt</li>
  <li>If you can&rsquo;t hit these targets, focus on cutting fixed costs first (negotiate rent, refinance loans) or earning more</li>
  <li>Create &ldquo;spending rules&rdquo; &mdash; always buy books, always fly business class, never spend on cable TV</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>&ldquo;A friend of mine spends $21,000/year going out. I gasped when I saw the number&hellip; but then I realized: When I looked at his numbers, he had set it up exactly like I recommended. He was spending only a percentage of his income on going out. It was a big number, but he earned enough that it was completely guilt-free.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 5: Save While Sleeping</h3>

<h4>The Automatic Money Flow</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Paycheck deposits to checking (and 401(k) comes out pre-tax)</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2 (1st of month):</strong> Automatic transfer from checking to Roth IRA</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3 (5th of month):</strong> Automatic transfers to savings sub-accounts (emergency, goals)</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4 (5th of month):</strong> Automatic bill pay for credit cards (FULL BALANCE), rent, utilities</li>
  <li><strong>Remaining:</strong> guilt-free spending money stays in checking</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Set it up once, then it runs forever</li>
  <li>You can&rsquo;t forget to save or invest &mdash; the system does it for you</li>
  <li>&ldquo;The most important thing isn&rsquo;t the exact percentages&hellip; it&rsquo;s that you have a system at all.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<!-- CHAPTER 6 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 6: The Myth of Financial Expertise</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>75%+ of actively managed mutual funds underperform the market</strong> (and it gets worse over longer periods)</li>
  <li>Financial pundits&rsquo; predictions are <strong>worse than chance</strong></li>
  <li>Hedge funds: the average investor pays huge fees and gets mediocre returns. Warren Buffett&rsquo;s famous bet: a simple S&amp;P 500 index fund beat a basket of hedge funds over 10 years.</li>
  <li><strong>Expense ratios are the hidden killer:</strong> 1% fee vs. 0.14% fee over 30 years on $100,000 means losing tens of thousands of dollars</li>
  <li>Financial newsletters and stock-picking services consistently underperform</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Think about it: Of the thousands of financial &lsquo;experts&rsquo; who appear on TV and in magazines, how many of them actually beat the market? Less than 25 percent&hellip; and past performance is no predictor of future results.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<!-- CHAPTER 7 -->
<h3 class="chapter-header">Chapter 7: Investing Isn&rsquo;t Only for Rich People</h3>

<h4>The Two Paths</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Target date fund (recommended for 85%):</strong> One fund, automatic rebalancing, gets more conservative over time. Buy it and never think about it again.</li>
  <li><strong>Build your own portfolio:</strong> For the ambitious. Use David Swensen&rsquo;s model as a template.</li>
</ol>

<h4>David Swensen&rsquo;s Model Portfolio</h4>

<ul>
  <li>One of the shortest chapters &mdash; because you&rsquo;ve already done the hard work</li>
  <li><strong>Before optimizing further, ask: What&rsquo;s the point?</strong> Get specific about your &ldquo;street-level motivation&rdquo;</li>
  <li><strong>Feed your system:</strong> Every extra dollar you invest today is worth many more tomorrow</li>

<h4>Six Tax Truths</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Getting a tax refund is actually great</strong> (you would have spent that money)</li>
  <li><strong>The US is NOT the highest-taxed nation</strong></li>
  <li><strong>It&rsquo;s NOT better to earn less for tax reasons</strong> &mdash; learn marginal tax brackets</li>
  <li><strong>People have no idea where tax money goes</strong> (~1% to foreign aid, not 25%)</li>
  <li><strong>Rich people don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;use loopholes&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; most legitimate advantages are available to everyone (tax-advantaged accounts)</li>
  <li><strong>Your politics cloud your rational judgment</strong> on taxes</li>
</ol>

<h4>Annual Financial Checklist</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conscious Spending Plan (3 hours):</strong> Reassess subscriptions, renegotiate bills, check investment percentage</li>
  <li><strong>Negotiate fees (2 hours):</strong> Cell phone, car insurance, cable, bank fees</li>
  <li><strong>Investments (2 hours):</strong> Confirm maxing 401(k) and Roth IRA, money is actually invested (not sitting in cash)</li>
  <li><strong>Debt (2 hours):</strong> Revisit payoff plan, check credit report and score, renegotiate APRs</li>
  <li><strong>Credit cards (1 hour):</strong> Use your points, ask about unused perks</li>
  <li><strong>Earn more (ongoing):</strong> Negotiate a raise, make money on the side</li>
</ul>

<h4>When to Sell Investments</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Only three reasons:</strong> (1) Emergency &mdash; use savings, earn more, or borrow first (2) Terrible investment consistently underperforming its industry (3) You achieved the specific goal you were saving for</li>
  <li><strong>Hold investments long-term:</strong> Short-term gains taxed at 25-35%; long-term at ~15%</li>
  <li>In retirement accounts: no tax consequences for selling and rebalancing</li>
</ul>

<h4>Student Loans: Pay Down or Invest?</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Pay minimums on loans, invest the rest (best if interest rate &lt; ~4%)</li>
  <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Aggressively pay off loans first (good for peace of mind)</li>
  <li><strong>Option 3 (recommended):</strong> Hybrid 50/50 approach &mdash; half to loans, half to investing. Best of both worlds.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Navigating Money with Loved Ones</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Partners:</strong> Talk about money early and often. Start broad (&ldquo;How do you think about money?&rdquo;), share vulnerabilities, agree on shared goals</li>
  <li><strong>The Big Meeting:</strong> Both partners bring all accounts, debts, income, expenses, and goals. Work through the book together. Check in every 6-12 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Unequal incomes:</strong> Split expenses proportionally (Suze Orman approach &mdash; not 50/50)</li>
  <li><strong>Irresponsible spending:</strong> Redirect to &ldquo;the plan&rdquo; (the Conscious Spending Plan on paper) rather than making it personal</li>
  <li><strong>Parents in debt:</strong> Ask gentle questions, listen, offer the 85% Solution. If they don&rsquo;t want help, respect their decision.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Salary Negotiation: The 9 Basics</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Nobody cares about you</strong> &mdash; frame everything around how you benefit the company</li>
  <li><strong>Have another offer</strong> &mdash; the single most effective leverage</li>
  <li><strong>Come prepared</strong> &mdash; research salary ranges, bring a strategic plan</li>
  <li><strong>Have a toolbox of negotiating tricks</strong> &mdash; ask what makes someone extraordinary in the role, match your skills</li>
  <li><strong>Negotiate more than money</strong> &mdash; bonus, stock, flexibility, title, vacation, education</li>
  <li><strong>Be cooperative, not adversarial</strong> &mdash; find a fair package, not win a war</li>
  <li><strong>Smile</strong> &mdash; one of the most effective techniques</li>
  <li><strong>Practice with friends</strong> &mdash; role-play with the toughest friend you have</li>
  <li><strong>Save face if it doesn&rsquo;t work</strong> &mdash; negotiate a renegotiation in 6 months, get it in writing</li>
</ol>

<h4>Five Things Never Do in a Negotiation</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t reveal your current salary</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t make the first offer</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t reveal a mediocre company name if you have another offer</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t ask yes/no questions &mdash; use collaborative framing</li>
  <li>Never lie</li>
</ol>

<h4>Myths About Owning a Home</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;Prices always go up&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; Not true when you factor in inflation, taxes, and fees</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;Leverage multiplies your money&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; It also multiplies your losses. A 10% decline plus 6% Realtor fees, closing costs, etc. = ~20% loss</li>
  <li><strong>&ldquo;Mortgage interest deduction saves money&rdquo;</strong> &mdash; You&rsquo;re &ldquo;saving&rdquo; money you never would have spent. Plus 2018 laws reduced this benefit.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Future Large Purchases: Three Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Acknowledge reality</strong> &mdash; things cost more than you think. Spend 20 minutes making a realistic plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up automatic savings</strong> &mdash; figure out monthly amounts for wedding, car, kid, down payment.</li>
  <li><strong>Use the P word: Priorities.</strong> You can&rsquo;t have the best of everything. Write trade-offs on paper so they&rsquo;re visible.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Giving Back</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Once your financial system is running, elevate your goals beyond the day-to-day</li>
  <li>You don&rsquo;t need to be rich to give back &mdash; even $100 helps</li>
  <li>Donate time, money, or skills to causes that matter to you</li>
  <li>The IWT community raised $300,000+ for Pencils of Promise (13 schools built)</li>
</ul>
