## Open Letter to New Readers
- If you had invested $100/month for 10 years, $12,000 would have turned into $20,000+ (S&P 500 averaged ~13%/year over the last decade)
- If you had invested $1,000/month, $120,000 would have grown to $200,000+
- You'd spend less than 90 minutes per month on money
- Three mistakes from first edition: (1) didn't cover emotions/psychology of money, (2) was too overbearing about one path to wealth, (3) printed actual interest rates which changed
- **Invisible scripts**: messages absorbed from parents and society that guide financial decisions unconsciously. Examples: "You're throwing money away on rent," "Credit cards are a scam," "The stock market is gambling"
- FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) — some save 50% and reach "crossover point" where investments pay for life forever

## Introduction: Would You Rather Be Sexy or Rich?

### Money and Food Parallel
- We don't track calories → we don't track spending
- We eat more than we know → we spend more than we realize
- We debate minutiae (diets, workouts) → we debate interest rates and hot stocks
- We value anecdotal advice → we listen to friends/TV instead of reading good finance books
- 99.99% of weight loss = eat less, exercise more. 99.99% of getting rich = spend less, earn more, invest the difference

### Why Managing Money Is Hard
- **Info Glut**: Too much information leads to decision paralysis. Barry Schwartz (*The Paradox of Choice*): For every 10 funds added to a 401(k), participation drops 2%. Those who do invest pick ultraconservative money market funds.
- **Smart Sally vs. Dumb Dan**: Sally invests $200/month starting at 35 for 10 years. Dan invests $200/month starting at 45 for 20 years. At 8% return, Sally has $181,469 vs. Dan's $118,589. Starting early beats investing longer.
- **The best time to start investing was 10 years ago. The second best time is today.**
- **Media blame**: Financial sites write for pageviews ("10 Frugality Tips"), not behavior change. Estate tax affects 0.2% of people but gets endless coverage.

### The Rise of Victim Culture
- People compete to be the bigger victim: "I can't afford to save," "Baby boomers ruined it"
- Cynics surrounded themselves with naysayers and missed hundreds of thousands in gains
- Socioeconomic factors matter, but focus on what you can control
- "Save $1,000 in 30 Days Challenge" — thousands joined and saved. But some complained they didn't earn $1,000/month. If you can't save $1,000, save $500 or $200.

### Common Excuses Debunked
- **"Our education system doesn't teach this"** — Most colleges do offer finance classes. You just didn't take them.
- **"Credit card companies are out to profit off us"** — Yes. Learn to beat them instead of complaining.
- **"I'm afraid of losing money"** — Economy is cyclical. If you pulled out in 2009, you missed one of the longest bull runs in history. When others are scared, there are bargains.
- **"I don't know where to get an extra $100/month"** — CEO Method: Cut costs, Earn more, Optimize existing spending.
- **"I don't want average returns"** — Average 8% returns are actually very good. People who fear "being average" trade frequently, make outlandish bets, pay high taxes and fees, and perform *worse* than average.

### The Key Messages
1. **The 85 Percent Solution**: Getting started > becoming an expert. 85% right beats 0%. Don't let perfectionism prevent action.
2. **It's okay to make mistakes** — better now with small money than later with big money.
3. **Spend extravagantly on what you love, cut mercilessly on what you don't.** Conscious spending = prioritizing what matters to you.
4. **There's a difference between being sexy and being rich.** Buy-and-hold is boring but wins long term. "I bought a few good funds five years ago and haven't done anything since" = the winning strategy.
5. **Don't live in the spreadsheet.** Automate, then go live your life.
6. **Play offense, not defense.** Go on offense with credit cards, banks, investments, and money psychology.
7. **This book is about using money to design your Rich Life.** Automatic financial infrastructure that runs with minimal intervention.

### 10 Rules for a Rich Life
1. Spend extravagantly on things you love, cut mercilessly on things you don't
2. Focus on Big Wins (5-10 things with disproportionate results): automate savings, invest, negotiate salary
3. Investing should be boring and very profitable over the long term
4. There's a limit to cutting costs, but no limit to earning. Earnings are superlinear.
5. Friends/family will have unsolicited "tips" — listen politely, stick to the program
6. Build "spending frameworks" — decide in advance what you'll always spend on (e.g., books: always buy, don't debate)
7. Beware searching for "advanced" tips — the basics done consistently ARE the advanced move
8. You're in control. Nobody's coming to rescue you.
9. Be willing to be unapologetically different with your Rich Life
10. Live life outside the spreadsheet — automate money, then focus on relationships, experiences, giving back

### What You'll Get Out of This Book
- Investing isn't about picking stocks — your investment *plan* matters more than any individual pick
- Individual investors talking about derivatives and call options is like elementary tennis players arguing about racquet string tension — just go practice
- Simple, long-term investing works
- The 6-week program helps you figure out where money is going and redirect it

### "Rich" Is Personal
- Ask: Why do you want to be rich? What does being rich mean to you?
- Ramit's definition: Make career decisions because I want to, not because of money. Help parents with retirement. Spend extravagantly on what I love, be frugal on what I don't.
- Every December, sit down with partner and plan the next year intentionally
- Get specific about your Rich Life — write it down, no matter how small or big

## Chapter 1: Optimize Your Credit Cards
*How to beat the credit card companies at their own game*

### Negotiation Culture
- Indian families are fanatical about negotiating. Ramit's dad bargained for 5 days on a car, then walked away over $50 floor mats.
- Ramit's modern approach: invited 17 car dealers to bid against each other by email. Got the best deal without leaving home.
- Car dealer offered 4.9% instead of promised 1.9% — difference was $2,200+ over the loan. He negotiated but still paid more than promised.
- **Key insight**: It's not worth negotiating everything, but there are a few Big Win areas where negotiation pays huge dividends.

### Credit Card Scare Tactics (What Media Gets Wrong)
- **Scary stats**: Median US household credit card debt is $2,241; median student loan debt is $17,711. Four in 10 adults can't cover a $400 emergency.
- **Scary headlines**: "Looming debt crisis" stories designed for pageviews, not solutions
- **Scary emotions**: Media uses confusion, anxiety, lies to sell ads. Result: people shut down and do nothing.
- **Student loans can be a great decision**: Bachelor's degree holders earn $1M+ more lifetime than high school only. College is almost always worth it financially. But predatory schools/programs are a real problem.

### The Way Ramit Sees Credit Cards
- **Credit cards give thousands of dollars in perks** if you pay on time: free short-term loans, spending tracking, transaction history, warranty extensions, rental car insurance, rewards points
- **Credit cards are convenient enemies** — everyone has a bad story, pundits say "cut them all up"
- **The truth is in between**: Managed well, they're worth having. But ~14% APR on unpaid balances, $35 late fees, and ease of overspending are real dangers.
- **Goal**: Play offense — use cards responsibly, squeeze every benefit, boost your credit score

### Credit Score vs. Credit Report
- **Credit report**: basic info about you, accounts, payment history — free once/year at annualcreditreport.com
- **Credit score (FICO)**: single number 300-850 representing risk to lenders. Get at myfico.com (small fee) or Credit Karma (free but less accurate).
- **What your credit score is based on**:
  - 35% payment history (most important — pay on time!)
  - 30% amounts owed (credit utilization rate)
  - 15% length of history (older accounts = better)
  - 10% new credit (fewer inquiries = better)
  - 10% types of credit (variety is good)

### How Credit Scores Affect What You Pay
- On a $200,000 30-year mortgage:
  - 760-850 score: 4.279% APR → $355,420 total
  - 620-639 score: 5.868% APR → $425,585 total
  - **Difference: $70,165** — more than cutting lattes for a lifetime

### Getting a New Card
- Don't accept mail offers or retail store cards (predatory, high fees, terrible rewards)
- Pick cash back OR travel rewards. Cash back is simpler; travel requires more optimization.
- Use bankrate.com to compare options
- If you spend thousands/month, fee-based rewards cards are usually worth it
- **Ramit's cards**: Chase Sapphire Reserve (travel/dining), Alliant cash back (everything else), Capital One business card, Amex Platinum (extra benefits)
- **Key rule**: Travel/eating out → travel card. Everything else → cash back card.
- Don't go card crazy — 2-3 cards is the sweet spot. Average American has 4.

### The Six Commandments of Credit Cards

**1. Pay off your credit card regularly.**
- Payment history = 35% of score (the single biggest factor)
- Pay in full, on time. Set up automatic payments.
- Even paying just part, pay it on TIME. Being a few days late can drop score 100+ points.
- **Awful consequences of missing ONE payment**: score drops 100+ points, APR can jump to 30%, late fee ~$35, can trigger rate increases on OTHER cards too

**2. Try to get fees waived.**
- Call the number on back of card, ask if you're paying any fees
- Script: "I'd rather pay no fees. Can you waive this year's annual fee?"
- If they won't waive, ask them to switch you to a no-fee card at the same company (avoids closing account)
- Works sometimes — but always worth asking

**3. Negotiate a lower APR.**
- APRs hover around 13-16%, very expensive if carrying a balance
- Call and say you've been paying on time, know competitors offer better rates
- Works about half the time
- If you pay in full monthly, APR technically doesn't matter — but still worth the call

**4. Keep your main cards for a long time, keep them active — but also keep them simple.**
- Length of history = 15% of score. Longer = better.
- Don't get lured by intro offers if you're happy with your card
- Set up a small automatic payment on rarely-used cards to keep them active
- **Closing old cards**: If you have good credit and too many cards, closing inactive ones is fine — long-term impact is minimal. Simplicity > a few credit score points.
- 2-3 cards is ideal for most people

**5. Get more credit (only if you have NO debt).**
- Improves credit utilization rate (amount owed / total available credit = 30% of score)
- Example: $1,000 owed with $4,000 available = 25% utilization. Better than $1,000/$1,000 = 100%.
- Call and ask for a credit limit increase. Script: "I'd like a credit limit increase. I currently have $5,000 and I'd like $10,000."
- Request every 6-12 months
- **First priority is always pay off debt, THEN increase available credit**

**6. Use your credit card's secret perks.**
- Call your card once a year to ask what advantages you're eligible for
- Script: "I have a 750 credit score, been a customer for 4 years. What special promotions and offers do you have?"
- **Hidden perks most people don't know about**:
  - Automatic warranty doubling on purchases
  - Car rental insurance (skip the dealer's collision coverage!)
  - Trip-cancellation insurance ($3,000-$10,000 per trip)
  - Concierge services (can find hard-to-get tickets, etc.)
  - Spending tracking/categorization for budgeting

### Always Track Your Calls to Financial Companies
- Keep a spreadsheet: Call Date, Time, Name of Rep, Rep's ID#, Comments
- When you call to dispute, refer to your previous notes (name, date, what was agreed)
- Reps will instantly take you seriously — you came prepared

### Mistakes to Avoid
- **Think ahead before closing accounts**: Don't close within 6 months of a major loan application
- **Manage debt to avoid damaging credit score**: If closing a card, pay off enough debt first to keep utilization rate the same
- **Don't play the zero percent transfer game**: Borrowing at 0% to invest for interest is a huge waste of time, high risk of mismanaging, not worth the few bucks. Dave Ramsey: "I have never met one who said he made it all with Discover card bonus points."
- **If credit score drops**: Don't panic. Get your report, figure out why, then focus on going forward. "The natural movement of these scores is to slowly grow" — Craig Watts, FICO

### Rate Chasers: Wasting Time Earning $25/Month
- Reader "Mike" admitted chasing savings account rates — moving $40,000 between banks for 0.65-0.85% extra ($300/year = $0.82/day)
- **Ramit's response**: That's impressive savings, but $300/year is not worth the effort. Spend that time on asset allocation (worth thousands), starting a side business, or spending time with family.
- **Focus on Big Wins** — they may not be as sexy as chasing rates, but they make you rich long term.

### Debt, Debt, Debt
- Statistically, being in debt is "normal" — but is it really normal to owe more than you have?
- "Good debt" (education, house) vs. "bad debt" (depreciating assets, random purchases)
- Two biggest types: student loans and credit card debt
- **The answer isn't just "money" — it's psychology**

### Invisible Money Scripts (Dr. Brad Klontz)
- **Definition**: "Typically unconscious, trans-generational beliefs about money developed in childhood that drive your behavior today"
- Recognizing them helps you understand your own behavior

| Invisible Script | What It Means |
|---|---|
| "It's not so bad. Everyone has credit card debt." | We compare ourselves to others in worse situations to feel better — but it doesn't change anything |
| "$100 is just a drop in the bucket compared to what I owe." | When the problem is big enough, we rationalize any single change as "not enough" (parallels with being overweight) |
| "Paying interest is just like any other fee." | Normalization — nobody who says this understands the math of 14% interest |
| "These credit card companies just try to trap you." | Surrendering responsibility. Yes, companies want fees — but you made the decisions. Until you take responsibility, they'll remain a convenient enemy. |
| "I don't even know how much I owe." | 75%+ of people in debt don't know how much. The truth is too painful, so they ignore it. Power comes from acknowledging and making a plan. |
| "I'm just trying to do my best." | The most hopeless script — saying "I have no control, life happens to me." Very difficult to change from this mindset. |

- These invisible money scripts explain why people in debt avoid opening mail, keep spending $800 on trips while owing thousands
- People are not purely rational — scripts honed over 20+ years are hard to change
- **Goal of this book**: Show you that you *can* change your money stories

### People Don't Know How Much Debt They're In
- Binyamin Appelbaum, *NYT*: Only 50% of households reported any credit card debt, while credit card companies reported 76% of households owed them money
- Fewer than 25% know how much they owe; 95% don't know their payoff date
- **Having a plan turns debt from a "hot" emotional topic into a "cool" math problem**
- A plan gives you control — might take 3 months or 10 years, but you'll know you're on track

### The Burden of Student Loans
- Average student graduates with ~$30,000 in debt (many have $100,000+)
- Even bankruptcy doesn't erase student loans
- Extra $100/month saves thousands in interest and years of payments
- **Example**: Tony has $30,000 in student loans over 10 years. Standard payment ~$345/month = $11,429 interest. Paying $100 more/month = $7,898 interest and done in 7.2 years.
- **Three action steps**:
  1. Use bankrate.com calculators to see how different payment amounts change total cost
  2. Put at least $50 more/month toward debt (automatic, from checking account)
  3. If you can't pay it off in reasonable time, **call your lender** — ask about restructuring payments, changing timeline, consolidation
- Questions to ask lender: "What if I paid $100 more per month?" / "What if I changed from 5 to 15 years?" / "What if I'm looking for a job and can't afford 3 months?"
- One call could save thousands of dollars

### When Credit Cards Go Bad
- Things go wrong little by little, not overnight — like *Dr. Phil* problems that seem obvious from outside but aren't when they're yours
- Credit card debt is almost always manageable with a plan and discipline
- **Shame is real**: 75% of Americans claim they don't make major purchases unless they can pay it off immediately — yet 70%+ carry a balance. Fewer than half will reveal their debt to a friend.
- Greg McBride (Bankrate): "They are more willing to give their name, age, and even details of their sex lives than the amount of their credit card debt."
- Shame → don't educate themselves → fall victim to predatory practices → more debt (vicious cycle)
- **#1 mistake**: Carrying a balance / not paying in full. Of 125 million Americans with monthly balances, half pay only the minimum.
- **Key rule repeated**: Pay your credit card in full every month.

### Pay Your Debt Off Aggressively
- Triple whammy of credit card debt:
  1. High interest on the balance
  2. Credit score suffers (30% is utilization) → harder to get credit for house/car/apartment → pay more because of poor credit
  3. Emotional overwhelm → avoid bills → more late payments → more debt (vicious circle of doom)
- **Dumb Dan vs. Smart Sally** ($5,000 at 14% APR):
  - Dumb Dan pays minimum (~$100 variable): 25+ years, $6,322 in interest
  - Smart Sally pays $100 fixed: 6 years 4 months, $2,548 in interest
  - Super Smart Sally pays $200 fixed: 2 years 6 months, $946 in interest
  - Ultra-aggressive $400/month: 1 year 2 months, ~$400 in interest
- Even $20 extra/month dramatically shortens payoff time
- **"Deadbeat"**: Credit card companies' term for customers who pay in full every month — worthless to them because they generate no interest revenue. Be a deadbeat.

### Five Steps to Getting Rid of Credit Card Debt

**Step 1: Figure out how much debt you have.**
- Most people don't do this — they blindly pay bills with no strategic plan
- Call each credit card company, get: total amount owed, APR, minimum monthly payment
- Put it all in a simple spreadsheet. This is the hardest step.

**Step 2: Decide what to pay off first.**
- Two schools of thought:
  - **Standard method**: Pay minimums on all cards, put extra money toward highest APR card (mathematically optimal)
  - **Dave Ramsey snowball**: Pay minimums on all, put extra toward lowest balance first (psychological wins from quick payoffs)
- Snowball isn't mathematically optimal (lowest balance ≠ highest APR), but psychologically rewarding — seeing one card paid off motivates you to tackle the next
- **Bottom line**: Don't spend more than 5 minutes deciding. Pick one method and start. The goal is action, not optimization.

**Step 3: Negotiate down the APR.**
- 50/50 odds of success, takes only 5 minutes — always worth trying
- Script: "I'm going to be paying off my credit card debt more aggressively. I'd like a lower APR. Other cards are offering rates at half of what you're offering. Can you lower my rate by 50 percent, or only 40 percent?"
- If they say no, counter with: "Other credit cards are offering 0% intro rates for 12 months and APRs of half what you're offering. I've been a customer for X years and I'd prefer not to switch. Can you match or go lower?"
- If successful, recalculate your debt spreadsheet with the new rate

**Step 4: Decide where the money to pay off your credit cards will come from.**
- **Balance transfers**: Not recommended. Band-Aid for a spending behavior problem. Process is fraught with tricks. Better to negotiate APR down on current accounts.
- **Taking from 401(k) or HELOC**: Not recommended. Adds complexity, and people with credit card debt often find it hard to reduce spending — risk losing your home if you use HELOC money and run up more debt.
- **Reducing spending and prioritizing debt**: The most sustainable way. Not sexy, but it works.
- Ask yourself: For every $100 you earn, how much goes to debt? $2? $5? What if you paid $10?
- Set up aggressive automatic transfers to pay off credit card debt
- Look for the money elsewhere in the book: "The Next $100" concept, Conscious Spending Plan, "Save $1,000 in 30 Days" Challenge, automatic payments

**Step 5: Get started.**
- Within the coming week, start paying more
- Remember the 85% Solution — don't overthink it
- Figure out how much you owe, decide how to pay it down, negotiate rates, and get started
- You can always fine-tune later. Action > perfection.

### Week One Action Steps
1. **Get your credit score and credit report** (1 hour) — myfico.com for score, annualcreditreport.com for report. Check for errors.
2. **Set up your credit card** (2 hours) — Make sure it's no-fee. If you want a new one, use bankrate.com.
3. **Make sure you're handling your credit cards effectively** (3 hours) — Set up automatic full payments, get fees waived, apply for more credit if debt-free, maximize perks.
4. **If you have debt, start paying it off** (1 week to plan, then start paying more) — Figure out how much you owe, call to negotiate APR, restructure payments, set up automatic payments with more than you're paying now.

# BATCH 4: Pages 101-120 (Chapter 2: Beat the Banks)

## Chapter 2: Beat the Banks
*Open high-interest, low-hassle accounts and negotiate fees like an Indian*

### The Problem with Big Banks
- Your neighborhood Big Bank is most likely ripping you off with fees and minimums
- Banks love average customers because we don't switch, don't know better about monthly fees and overdraft protection
- Amazon (Jeff Bezos): "If you build a great experience, customers tell each other." Banks are the opposite — they treat customers poorly and still keep them.
- Wells Fargo: fined $1 billion by regulators, employees opened 1,534,280 unauthorized deposit accounts (85,000 accrued $2 million in fees), forced 570,000 borrowers into unneeded auto insurance (~20,000 had cars repossessed)
- TIAA: Previously recommended by Ramit, then removed after lawsuits about heavy sales quotas and pushing unnecessary products
- **Good companies**: Schwab (phenomenal checking account, improved over time), Vanguard (long-term focus on low costs, actually *lower* fees over time)
- **"When companies — and people — show you who they truly are, believe them."**

### The 30-Second Test
- First 30 seconds in a restaurant tell you everything you need to know
- Same with banks: judge them by their past behavior. Good ones offer better services and no fees. Bad ones increase fees and devise new ways to take your money.

### How Banks Rake It In
- Banks earn money by lending out your deposits at higher interest rates (simple arbitrage)
- **FEES**: In 2017, banks made $34 billion from overdraft fees alone
- Overdraft example: Buy something for more than your balance → bank lets it go through → charges ~$30 overdraft fee. Multiple overdrafts in one day = $100+ in fees.
- **One overdraft fee wipes out your entire year of interest earnings**
- More than half of people at Ramit's talks have had at least one overdraft
- Bank fees can be more important than interest rates: $1,000 with 1% extra interest = $10/year. One overdraft = $30.

### Why Haven't You Switched Banks Yet? (Invisible Money Scripts)

| Script | Response |
|---|---|
| "It's a headache to switch banks." | You don't have to, but spending one day ensures the foundation of your financial system is solid. Recommended banks are more convenient, cheaper, and offer better rewards. |
| "I don't know where else I would go." | Just read the rest of this chapter. |
| "This was my first bank ever." | Do you have lifelong love for your first thumbtack? Your first garden hose? GTFO. |

### The Nuts and Bolts

#### Checking Accounts
- Backbone of your financial system — where money first goes before being "filtered" to savings, investing, guilt-free spending
- Think of it like an email inbox: money comes in, then gets apportioned out via automatic transfers
- Pay most bills through credit card, pay rent/car/etc. directly from checking via automatic transfers
- **#1 place where unnecessary fees are levied** — we're going to fix that

#### Savings Accounts
- For short-term (1 month) to mid-term (5 years) savings: vacations, gifts, weddings, house down payment
- Savings accounts technically pay more interest than checking, but at Big Banks the interest is essentially meaningless
- **Interest rate on savings is not that important**: $5,000 at 3% = $150/year ($12.50/month). At 0.5% = $25/year ($2.08/month). Difference of ~$10/month is not a Big Win.
- Inflation erodes savings — the bulk of your wealth will come from investing (Chapter 7)
- **Focus on the macro, not the micro**: Stop picking up pennies, focus on Big Wins. One year of investing returns > 500 years of savings account interest.

### Why You Need Both a Savings Account AND a Checking Account
- Checking = frequent withdrawals (debit cards, ATMs). Savings = "goals" account (house, vacation, emergency fund)
- **Keep them at two separate banks** — psychology keeps you from dipping into savings on a whim
- Savings account = where you deposit money (receiver). Checking = where you withdraw (sender).
- Banks that try to offer checking AND saving AND investing tend to be mediocre at all of them — pick the best of each

### Finding the Perfect Account Setup
- **Most basic (lazy)**: Checking + savings at any local bank. Bare minimum. Make sure you're not paying fees.
- **Basic + small optimization (recommended for most)**: No-fee checking at local bank + high-yield online savings account at a separate institution. Best of both worlds.
- **Advanced + full optimization**: Multiple checking and savings accounts at different banks to maximize interest/services. More complex, more accounts to manage. Only for people who enjoy optimizing.

### Ramit's Bank Account System
- **Checking**: Schwab Bank Investor Checking — all money goes here via direct deposit
- **Savings**: Capital One 360 — automatically withdraws from checking each month
- **System**: Monthly cycle — checking receives paycheck → auto-transfers to savings, investment account. Bills paid via credit card (auto-paid in full from checking). Cash via Schwab ATM card (all ATM fees reimbursed).
- Capital One 360 is a receiver, not a sender — rarely transfers money out unless covering a shortage or spending on something important

### So Many Choices, So Little Time
- Traditional banks offer tiered accounts: student (no fees, no minimums, bare-bones) → regular (nominal fees, waivable via direct deposit or minimum balance) → high-end ($5,000-$10,000 minimums, brokerage trades, "bonus" rates — avoid these)
- When choosing banks, look for three things: **trust, convenience, and features**

### Credit Unions
- Not-for-profit, owned by members — theoretically better service
- Ramit used to recommend them but changed his mind: too much navel-gazing about "being member-owned" instead of actually delivering better solutions and features
- Squandered the opportunity to position against predatory Big Banks

### Choosing Your Bank: Trust, Convenience, Features
- **Trust**: Don't trust Big Banks anymore. Ask friends, browse bank websites — within 5 minutes you can tell which are straightforward vs. nickel-and-diming. No junk mail, no cross-sells.
- **Convenience**: Website must work well, easy to put money in/out/around, email or phone support when needed
- **Features**: Competitive interest rate, free/easy transfers, free bill pay, app/website you enjoy using

### Don't Be a Rate Chaser
- If your bank offers one rate and another offers slightly higher, **don't switch**
- Half the time those are introductory teaser rates that drop after 6 months
- 0.5% rate difference on savings = a few dollars/month more in interest — colossal waste of time
- **Stick with your bank for decades. Focus on Big Wins, not rate jumping.**

### Five Shiny Marketing Tactics Banks Use to Trick You
1. **Teaser rates** ("6% for the first two months!") — your first 2 months don't matter. Banks that offer teasers are to be avoided.
2. **Requiring minimum balances** to get "free" services — no, go somewhere else
3. **Up-sells** to expensive "value-added" accounts ("Expedited customer service! Wow!") — designed to charge for worthless services
4. **Holding out** by claiming no-fee accounts aren't available — be firm, they'll find one. If not, go elsewhere. Buyer's market.
5. **Bundling a credit card** with your bank account — if you didn't walk in wanting it, don't get it

### The Best Accounts (Ramit's Picks)

#### Checking Accounts
- **Schwab Bank Investor Checking** (schwab.com/banking) — Ramit's #1 pick. No fees, no minimums, no-fee overdraft protection, free bill pay, free checks, ATM card with **unlimited ATM fee reimbursement worldwide**. Must open a Schwab brokerage account (can sit empty). Can't deposit physical cash — pair with local bank if needed.
- **Local bank checking** — for people who regularly deposit cash. Get no-fee, no-minimum account (student accounts, direct deposit, or minimum balance to waive fees).

#### Savings Accounts
- **Capital One 360 Savings** (capitalone.com/bank) — Ramit's pick. Virtual sub-savings accounts for goals (emergency fund, wedding, house). Automatic transfers, no fees, no minimums, no up-sells. Simple and works.
- **Ally Online Savings** (ally.com/bank) — Also recommended. No-fee, multiple savings accounts, solid interest rates.
- Others to consider: Marcus by Goldman Sachs, American Express Personal Savings

#### Banks to Consider vs. Avoid
- **Consider**: Ally, Capital One 360, Schwab, Marcus, Amex Personal Savings
- **Avoid**: Bank of America, Wells Fargo

### Optimizing Your Bank Accounts
- You shouldn't be paying fees or minimums
- Key to optimizing: **talk to an actual customer service rep** (in person or phone)
- Most of the best deals require talking to someone — pick up the phone

### Avoiding Monthly Fees
- If you're lending the bank money (deposits), you shouldn't pay them additional fees
- $5/month fee wipes out all interest earned
- Get fees waived via direct deposit or maintaining a minimum balance
- If bank won't waive fees, switch to an online high-interest account with no fees and no minimums
- Some charges are okay (money orders, reordering checks)

### Almost All Bank Fees Are Negotiable
- Most painful fees = overdraft fees. Best way to avoid: automatic transfers + keep ~$1,000 cash cushion in checking.
- Banks will waive a first-time fee if you ask. After that, harder but possible with a good excuse.
- **Script for waiving overdraft fee**: "Hi, I just saw this bank charge for overdrafting, and I'd like to have it waived."
- **Bad things to say**: "Are you sure?" / "Is there anything else I can do?" / "Okay" — these make it easy for the rep to say no
- **Good approach**: "I see the fee here, and I'd really like to get it waived. What else can you do to help me?" (Repeat complaint, ask them to constructively fix it)
- ~85% of people get fees refunded this way
- If still denied, escalate: "I've been a customer for 3+ years, I'd like to keep the relationship going. It was a mistake, it won't happen again. What can you do to help?"
- Works for overdraft fees, processing fees, late fees, even ATM fees
- **Customer-acquisition cost > $100** — banks don't want to lose you over a $5 fee. Use this as leverage.

### When They Say "We Don't Have No-Fee Accounts"
- Script: "I'd like my account to have no annual fees, free checking, and no minimum balance, please."
- If "we don't offer that": "That's interesting, because [competitor] is offering me that exact deal. Could you check again?"
- 80% of the time, you'll get a great account. If not, ask for supervisor.
- Supervisor script: "I've been a customer for X years, I want to find a way to make this work. Your customer-acquisition cost runs hundreds of dollars. What can you do to help me stay a customer?"

### Week Two Action Steps
1. **Open a checking account or assess the one you have** (1 hour) — Make sure it's no-fee, no-minimum. Call bank to confirm. If paying fees, negotiate to get switched.
2. **Open an online high-interest savings account** (3 hours) — Separate from checking (psychologically powerful). Compare banks at bankrate.com.
2a. **Optional: Open an online checking account** (2 hours) — If you want to be more advanced, get a high-interest online checking account too.
3. **Fund your online savings account** (1 hour) — Leave 1.5 months of living expenses in checking (overdraft buffer). Transfer the rest to savings, even if it's only $30.

## Chapter 3: Get Ready to Invest
*Open your 401(k) and Roth IRA — even with just $50*

### Why Saving Alone Isn't Enough
- Median retirement balance for ages 56-61 is only $25,000 — could have been achieved by investing just $6/month since 1980 into a 60/40 portfolio
- Saving $100/month in a high-interest savings account won't produce impressive results — saving is not enough, you need to invest
- **Compounding**: "Mankind's greatest invention" (Einstein). Allows for reliable, systematic accumulation of wealth.
- **Savings vs. Investing** ($1,000 at age 35, 30-year horizon):
  - Savings account (3%): grows to $2,427 on paper, but inflation drags purchasing power back to where you started
  - Investing (8%): grows to over $10,000 — ten times more, eclipsing inflation
- This chapter sets up the accounts. Chapter 7 tells you *what* to invest in.

### Why Your Friends Probably Haven't Invested a Cent Yet
- Most young people say "I don't know how to pick stocks" — ironic because **investing isn't about picking stocks**
- Some participate in a 401(k) but that's the extent of their investing

### Three Startling Stats About People and 401(k)s
1. Only one-third of people participate in a 401(k)
2. Among those earning under $50,000/year, 96% fail to contribute the maximum
3. Only 1 in 5 contributes enough to get the full employer match — **80% are losing thousands in free money every year**

### Fear of Losing Money
- People are afraid of "possibly" losing money in the stock market — when they will *certainly* run out of money if they don't invest
- Washington Post: Most older people worry more about running out of money than dying → "workampers" in RVs picking up seasonal jobs
- **Peculiar risk beliefs**: We fear shark bites (should fear heart disease). When eggs go on sale, we're happy. When the stock market drops, we think it's bad. Long-term investors should *love* when the market drops — you can buy more shares for the same price.

### Median 401(k) Balances by Age
| Age | Median Balance |
|---|---|
| Under 25 | $1,325 |
| 25-34 | $8,192 |
| 35-44 | $23,491 |
| 45-54 | $43,467 |

### Three Categories of People
- **As**: Already managing money, want to optimize
- **Bs**: Not doing anything but could be persuaded to change (largest group)
- **Cs**: Lost causes — endless excuses, knuckleheaded reasons, money management at bottom of priorities
- Most people in their twenties are Bs — not great, not bad. Still time to set aggressive goals. But if they do nothing, they drift to C.

### Invisible Investing Scripts

| Script | What It Means |
|---|---|
| "There are so many stocks, so many ways to buy and sell, it feels overwhelming." | Code for "I want to hide behind complexity." Pick one source of info and start learning. |
| "I feel like I'm always buying at the highs." | They intellectually "know" you can't time the market but don't really understand it. Automatic monthly investing solves this. |
| "I haven't invested because there are so many options (real estate, stocks, crypto, etc.) and stocks don't feel 'controllable.'" | Irony: believing "control" helps returns. Data shows average investor buys high, sells low, trades frequently, incurs taxes. Less control = better returns. Just let go. |
| "Due to my lack of knowledge, I don't wish to lose my hard-earned money." | Every day you don't invest, you ARE losing money to inflation. You won't realize until your 70s, when it's too late. |
| "Fees are a big part of it. Trading fees can make a big dent." | People think investing = trading stocks. Following Ramit's advice, investment fees are extremely low. |
| "Ordered a small coffee instead of a large, so I'm saving X dollars a day. Am I adulting?" | "You will die alone." |

### Boring but True
- Two-thirds of America's millionaires are self-made (parents weren't rich)
- They built wealth through controlling spending, regular investing, and entrepreneurship — not as sexy as winning the lottery, but much more realistic
- US Trust survey: "83% of the wealthy say their largest investment gains came from smaller wins over time rather than big risks"
- **Not about how much you earn — about how much you save and invest.** A project manager earning $50K can have higher net worth than a doctor earning $250K.
- APA: Americans today are less happy than in the 1950s, despite eating out twice as much and owning two times as many cars

### A Fifth of Young People Think They'll Get Rich Through the Lottery
| % of Young People | How They'll Get Rich |
|---|---|
| 21% | Winning the lottery |
| 11% | Through an inheritance |
| 3% | Via an insurance settlement |

- Information alone is not enough — you already "know" about compound interest. The real problem is psychology, emotions, invisible scripts.
- Learned helplessness is addictive: "LOL! Invest? Not possible. Baby boomers screwed me."
- About 1 in 4 people earning $100K+ still live paycheck to paycheck

### Investing Is the Single Most Effective Way to Get Rich
- The stock market is the biggest money-making vehicle in history
- You don't have to be rich to open an account — many providers waive minimums if you set up automatic monthly transfers

### Invest Now — You're Not Getting Any Younger (at 8% returns)
| Weekly Investment | After 1 Year | After 5 Years | After 10 Years |
|---|---|---|---|
| $10 | $541 | $3,173 | $7,836 |
| $20 | $1,082 | $6,347 | $15,672 |
| $50 | $2,705 | $15,867 | $39,181 |

### The Ladder of Personal Finance (6 Rungs)
1. **Rung 1**: If employer offers 401(k) match, contribute enough to get 100% of the match. This is FREE MONEY — no better deal exists.
2. **Rung 2**: Pay off credit card and other debt (average APR ~14%, paying it off = instant guaranteed return)
3. **Rung 3**: Open a Roth IRA and contribute as much as possible (up to $5,500/year in 2018; income limit ~$120K)
4. **Rung 4**: Go back to 401(k) and contribute as much as possible beyond the match (limit ~$19,000)
5. **Rung 5**: If you have access to an HSA (Health Savings Account), take advantage of it — incredible tax features, can double as investment account
6. **Rung 6**: Open a regular non-retirement ("taxable") investment account. Also pay extra on mortgage, invest in yourself (company, degree, career)

### Mastering Your 401(k)
- 401(k) = retirement account offered by employer. You agree not to withdraw until age 59½ (don't actually have to start withdrawing until 70½). In exchange, huge tax advantages.
- Setup: Fill out a form authorizing part of each paycheck to go to the 401(k). Money goes straight from employer — you never see it. Choose investment options, let it accumulate.

### 401(k) Benefit #1: Pre-Tax Money (Instant 25-40% Accelerator)
- Regular investment account: earn $100, pay ~25% income tax, invest $75
- 401(k): invest the full $100 pre-tax, let it compound for 30+ years. You pay taxes when you withdraw, but that extra 25% compounds enormously over time.

### 401(k) Benefit #2: Employer Match = Free Money
- Many employers match your contribution up to a percentage of your salary
- Example: $60K salary, company matches 1:1 up to 5%. You contribute $3,000 (5%), company adds $3,000 = $6,000 total per year.
- Starting at 25 with 8% returns: **$1.6 million with match vs. $800,000 without match** by retirement. The match *doubles* your returns.

### How a 401(k) Grows ($5,000/year contribution starting at age 25, 8% returns)
| Age | Without Match | With Match |
|---|---|---|
| 35 | $5,400 | $10,800 |
| 40 | $31,680 | $63,359 |
| 45 | $78,227 | $156,455 |
| 50 | $146,621 | $293,243 |
| 55 | $247,115 | $494,229 |
| 60 | $394,772 | $789,544 |
| 65 | $611,729 | $1,223,459 |

### 401(k) Benefit #3: Automatic Investing
- Money goes straight from paycheck → 401(k). You never see it, so you learn to live without it.
- "Opt-out" 401(k)s (auto-enrolled unless you opt out) dramatically increase participation — powerful psychology of defaults.

---

# BATCH 7: Pages 161-210 (Chapter 3 cont. + Chapter 4: Conscious Spending)

## Chapter 3: Get Ready to Invest (continued)

### Common Concerns About 401(k)s
- **What if I really need my money?** Withdrawing before 59½ = income taxes + 10% early-withdrawal penalty. Hardship withdrawals exist (medical, home purchase, education) but still taxed + penalized. Don't let this stop you — the biggest problem is not saving at all.
- **Will I have to pay taxes?** Yes — 401(k) is tax-deferred, not tax-free. You pay taxes when you withdraw after 59½. But your money compounded pre-tax for 30+ years, so you come out ahead.
- **What if I switch jobs?** Four options:
  1. **Roll into an IRA** (preferred) — call Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab, takes ~10 min, free
  2. **Roll into new company's 401(k)** — fine but limited fund choices
  3. **Leave at old company** — bad move, you'll forget about it
  4. **Cash out** — worst option. 50% of twentysomethings cash out 401(k) when leaving jobs. Huge tax + penalty hit. Don't do it!
- **What about a Roth 401(k)?** Uses after-tax money (like Roth IRA). Great if you expect higher tax rates later. No income restrictions (unlike Roth IRA). Can roll over to Roth IRA tax-free.

### Summary of 401(k) Advantages
- Pre-tax money compounds faster (25%+ head start)
- Employer match = free money (doubles your returns)
- Automatic — money goes straight from paycheck

### Do It Now: Setting Up Your 401(k)
- Call HR, get paperwork (~30 min). Read Chapter 7 before choosing funds.
- If employer matches: contribute enough to get 100% match. Example: 5% match on $50K salary = contribute $208/month.
- If employer doesn't match: open 401(k) anyway (no monthly fees), but don't contribute yet. Follow Ladder Rungs 2-3 first (debt + Roth IRA), then come back to Rung 4.

### Crush Your Debt
- If you have no credit card debt, skip this section.
- Student loan debt is okay to carry while investing (lower interest rates, large balances → set up payment schedule + invest simultaneously).
- Non-student debt: pay it off. Revisit "Five Steps to Getting Rid of Credit Card Debt" from Chapter 1.

### The Beauty of Roth IRAs
- After 401(k) match + debt crushed, climb to Rung 3: Roth IRA
- Not employer-sponsored — you contribute on your own
- Every person in their twenties should have one, even if also contributing to 401(k)
- **Key difference from 401(k):** Roth IRA uses *after-tax* dollars. You invest already-taxed income and pay NO tax when you withdraw. 401(k) uses pre-tax dollars and you pay taxes at withdrawal.
- You can invest in anything you want (index funds, individual stocks, etc.) — more flexibility than 401(k)
- **Example:** If Roth IRAs existed in 1972 and you invested $10,000 after-tax in Southwest Airlines (LUV), it would have grown to ~$10 million. You'd pay NO taxes on withdrawal. The $9,990,000 in gains = tax-free. Unbeatable.

### How Much Will a Roth IRA Save You?
| Years | Roth IRA | Regular Taxable Account | Doing Nothing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | $31,680 | $29,877 | $0 |
| 10 | $78,227 | $69,858 | $0 |
| 15 | $146,621 | $123,363 | $0 |
| 20 | $247,115 | $194,964 | $0 |
| 25 | $394,772 | $290,782 | $0 |
| 30 | $611,729 | $419,008 | $0 |
*(Assumptions: 25% tax rate, 8% returns, $5,000/year contribution)*

### Roth IRA Restrictions
- Penalized for withdrawing *earnings* before 59½ (but can always withdraw *principal* penalty-free)
- Exceptions: down payment on home, education funding, emergencies
- Must have Roth open 5+ years to qualify for exceptions — reason alone to open one NOW
- Max contribution: $5,500/year (2018). Income limit: ~$135,000 (reduced contributions above this; ineligible above certain income)

### How to Open a Roth IRA
- Open an investment brokerage account (think of brokerage as the "house," Roth IRA as one "room")
- Contributing as much as possible is almost as important as starting early
- Even waiting two years can cost tens of thousands

### Growth vs. Access
- Retirement accounts don't truly "lock up" money. Roth IRA principal = always withdrawable penalty-free. Both Roths and 401(k)s have hardship distribution options.
- If you need money in <5 years, use high-interest savings. Otherwise, invest.

### Recommended Discount Brokerages
| Brokerage | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vanguard | $1,000 | Ramit's personal recommendation. Relentless focus on low-cost funds. Don't waive minimums but savings are worth it. |
| Schwab | $1,000 | Minimum waived with $100/month auto-contribution. Schwab checking auto-links to brokerage. |
| Fidelity | $0 | No-minimum account, $0 fee for certain mutual funds. Target date funds still have higher expenses than Vanguard. |

### Factors to Consider When Choosing Brokerage
- **Minimums:** Full-service (Morgan Stanley) requires $50K+. Discount brokerages: $1,000-$3,000 for Roth IRA, often waived with automatic transfer.
- **Features:** 24/7 customer service, apps, easy websites are now standard across all. Don't overthink it.
- Don't spend hundreds of hours comparing. "All you need to do is open an investment account at a discount brokerage. Boom."
- Sign up takes ~1 hour. Tell them you want a Roth IRA. Connect checking account for automatic transfers.

### What About Robo-Advisors?
- Betterment, Wealthfront = investment firms using computer algorithms ("robo" = computer investing for you vs. expensive human adviser)
- Made elite financial planning services accessible to average people (like Uber did for private cars)
- **Pros:** Ease of use (beautiful apps, low minimums), low fees, goal-based planning
- **Cons (Ramit's strong opinion):** Not worth the cost. Better options exist.
  - Commission-based financial advisers hate robo-advisors (proves their logic isn't compelling)
  - Most people's finances are mostly the same — "one-size-fits-all" mostly works
  - Robo-advisors can't sustain on fees <0.4% without massive scale. Vanguard manages 9x more than Betterment, 10x more than Wealthfront.
  - VC-funded robo-advisors need rapid growth → eventually raise fees or add expensive products
  - **Wealthfront example:** Added higher-cost "risk-parity" fund and auto-enrolled customers without clear consent (WSJ 2018)
  - Tax-loss harvesting is a marketing gimmick — saves a little money but not the basis for choosing where to invest
- **Bottom line:** By the time you've narrowed to Vanguard vs. a robo-advisor, you've already made the most important choice (long-term, low-cost investing). Pick one and move on.

### Feed Your Investment Account
- Set up $50/month automatic contribution minimum. Money sits in Roth IRA waiting for you to choose investments (Chapter 7).

### Hungry for Even More?
- **Rung 4:** Max out 401(k) beyond employer match ($19,000/year limit in 2019). Employer match doesn't count toward limit.
- **Rung 5: HSAs — Your Secret Investing Weapon**
  - Health Savings Accounts let you set aside pre-tax money for medical expenses (deductibles, copays, coinsurance)
  - **Triple tax advantage:** Contribute tax-free, take a tax deduction, grow tax-free
  - Only available with high-deductible health insurance plans
  - Most people ignore HSAs (boring insurance topic + don't understand investment potential)
  - **The real power:** Treat HSA as investment vehicle. Most people don't spend all their HSA money on medical expenses — invest the rest tax-free!

### HSA Investment Examples ($3,000/year pre-tax, 20 years, 8% return)
- **Savings account (1% return):** $49,453 → after tax = $48,355. Basically lost to inflation.
- **Taxable investment account:** $102,964 → after 25% tax on gains = $82,768
- **401(k) (pre-tax):** $137,286 → after 25% tax at withdrawal = $102,964
- **Roth IRA (post-tax, $2,250/year):** $102,964 (no tax on gains). Same result as 401(k) but can change dramatically with employer match.
- **HSA (pre-tax, invested):** $137,286 — no taxes on contributions AND no taxes on gains. Best of all worlds!

### HSA Rules
- Medical expenses: use anytime, tax-free. After 65: spend on anything (taxable, like 401(k)). Before 65 for non-medical: penalty.
- Strategy: Pay medical expenses out of pocket, let HSA investments grow. Some people pay for as many expenses OOP as possible to maximize HSA growth.
- Choose HSA provider with low-cost index funds (target date or total stock market). Ramit uses Navia Benefits.

### Beyond Retirement Accounts (Rung 6)
- If you've maxed 401(k), Roth IRA, and HSA: open regular taxable investment account
- Alternative investments (crypto, options) covered in Chapter 7
- Buy a nice gift for someone you love — you have a lot of money!

### Congratulations! (Week Three Action Steps)
1. **Open your 401(k)** (3 hours) — get HR paperwork, contribute enough for full match
2. **Plan to pay off debt** (3 hours) — revisit 5 Steps to Getting Rid of Credit Card Debt
3. **Open a Roth IRA and set up automatic payments** (1 hour) — even $50/month is fine
4. **Find out if you're eligible for an HSA** (3 hours) — if eligible, open your account

## Chapter 4: Conscious Spending
*How to save hundreds per month (and still buy what you love)*

### The Problem with Budgeting
- Most people spend unconsciously — wince at bills, feel guilty, do it anyway
- "Budgeting" is the worst word in the history of the world
- 82% of Americans claim to have a budget (bankrate.com 2015) — complete nonsense
- Budgets fail because tracking every penny is overwhelming. People quit after two days.
- For 50+ years, personal finance writers have pushed daily tracking systems. One catch: NOBODY EVER DOES IT.

> *"I have a hard time wrapping my brain around how to set a budget and then not actually spend more than the budget allows."* — Sarah Robeson, 28

### The Conscious Spending Plan (Not a Budget)
- Forget budgeting. Instead: make sure you're saving and investing enough each month, then use the rest **guilt-free** for whatever you want.
- Plan where your money goes *ahead of time* (even on the back of a napkin). A couple hours of setup → automated spending decisions.

### The Difference Between Cheap People and Conscious Spenders

| Cheap | Conscious |
|---|---|
| Care about the *cost* of something | Care about the *value* of something |
| Try to get the lowest price on everything | Get lowest price on most things but spend extravagantly on items they care about |
| Their cheapness affects those around them | Their frugality affects only them |
| Inconsiderate (split $7.95 meal and put in $8) | Pick and choose (if $10 for lunch, order water instead of iced tea) |
| Make you uncomfortable by how they treat others | Make you uncomfortable because you realize you could do better |
| Keep a running tally of what others owe them | Some do this too, but certainly not all |
| Not always honest about spending (fear of judgment) | Neither are conscious spenders — everybody lies |
| Unreasonable about getting things for free | Try hard for deals but understand they don't intrinsically deserve one |
| Think short-term | Think long-term |

### Spend on What You Love
- Conscious spending = choosing things you love to spend extravagantly on, and cutting mercilessly on things you don't love
- Power in saying NO to things you don't care about, and BIG YES to things you love
- We were only taught to save money (cut back on coffee, hoard toilet paper). Nobody teaches how to *spend*.
- *Sex and the City* effect: friends' spending directly influences yours. Keeping up with friends is a full-time job.

> *"My Rich Life is guilt-free spending. I no longer say I can't afford X, Y, or Z. I say I choose not to spend on it."* — Donna Eade, 36

### Three Friends Spending Consciously

**The Shoe Lover (Lisa):** $5,000/year on shoes (~15 pairs at $300+). "RIDICULOUS!" — but she makes six figures, has a roommate, eats free at work, funds her 401(k) + taxable account, saves for vacation + charity. She's *chosen* shoes and cut mercilessly elsewhere (tiny apartment = $400/month less than coworkers).

**The Partier (John):** $21,000/year going out (4x/week, ~$100/night). Makes healthy six-figure salary. Skips vacations, has zero apartment decor (wire hangers), no spatula. Set up automatic investments so money goes to accounts before he sees it. Saved more than most friends in just a couple of years. He has a plan and executes it.

**The Nonprofit Employee (Julie):** $40K salary, saves $6,000+/year — more than most Americans. Cooks at home, shares apartment, uses employer benefits, checks envelope system before eating out. Maxes Roth IRA, saves for travel. Investing/saving is the first money transferred each month.

### What They're Doing Right
- They have a plan. They pay themselves first ($500/month or $2,000/month).
- Built automatic infrastructure: by the time money hits checking, they know they can spend it guilt-free.
- They're not experts — they've just got a head start.

### Does Money Make Us Happy?
- 2010 Deaton & Kahneman study: "emotional well-being" peaks at $75K. BUT "life satisfaction" has no plateau — not at $75K, $500K, or $1 million.
- More you earn = more satisfied with life (developing and developed countries alike).
- Whillans et al. (NYT): People who spend money to buy themselves time (outsourcing disliked tasks) report greater life satisfaction.
- Money is a small but important part of a Rich Life. Use it strategically.

### The Conscious Spending Plan — Four Buckets

| Category | % of Take-Home Pay |
|---|---|
| **Fixed costs** (rent, utilities, debt, etc.) | 50–60% |
| **Investments** (401(k), Roth IRA, etc.) | 10% |
| **Savings goals** (vacations, gifts, house down payment, emergency fund) | 5–10% |
| **Guilt-free spending money** (dining out, drinks, movies, clothes, shoes) | 20–35% |

### Monthly Fixed Costs
- Should be 50-60% of take-home pay
- Common expenses: rent/mortgage, utilities, medical insurance, car payment, public transportation, debt payments, groceries, clothes, internet/cable
- Fill in amounts you know, then check credit card/bank statements for past 2 months
- Add 15% for uncounted expenses (car repair, dry cleaning, donations, emergencies)
- Ramit's "stupid mistakes" category: started at $20/month, quickly raised to $200/month after $600 doctor visit + traffic ticket in same two months

### Long-Term Investments
- 10% of take-home pay to 401(k) + Roth IRA
- 401(k) contributions count toward the 10% (add pre-tax amount to take-home to get total monthly salary)
- Use bankrate.com investment calculator to experiment: $100, $200, $500, $1,000/month at 8% over 40 years = dramatic differences

### The 60 Percent Solution
- Richard Jenkins (MSN Money): 60% of gross income to basic expenses (food, bills, taxes). Remaining 40% split four ways: retirement savings (10%), long-term savings (10%), short-term savings for irregular expenses (10%), fun money (10%).
- Ramit's Conscious Spending Plan is similar but focused toward young people (more eating out/going out, less housing since we share apartments).

### Savings Goals (5-10% of take-home)
- Short-term: holiday gifts, birthday presents
- Mid-term: wedding (average $30K+)
- Long-term: house down payment
- **Wedding math:** If 25 years old, save $1,000+/month. If 26, save $2,500+/month.
- **House math:** $300K house, 20% down = $60K. In 5 years = $1,000/month. In 10 years = $500/month.
- Good rule of thumb: 5-10% of take-home pay for savings goals.

### How to Stop Feeling Guilty About Money
- Personal finance writers love to make you feel guilty ("Why buy a drink? Have water!" "Going on vacation? Walk in a park!")
- Trend: take any expense, compound it for 40 years, guilt-trip you. ("A $2,000 vacation invested for 40 years = $40,000!" *USA Today*: "How much for a sandwich? Try $90,000 in lost savings.")
- If you're counting pennies on sandwiches, you've taken a very wrong turn.
- Many IWT readers earning $200K+ can't bring themselves to spend. "They find it 'wasteful' to eat out even once every six months. THEY'VE CREATED THEIR OWN PRISON OF FRUGALITY."
- Ramit's approach: Get the Big Wins right → you'll never worry about the price of lunch. Guilt-free money for vacations, gifts, security — you decide.

> *"The biggest piece of advice I have used is to cut mercilessly on what is not important to me and to not feel guilty spending on what is since I have budgeted for it."* — Jessica Fitzer, 28

### Use Psychology Against Yourself to Save
- **The A La Carte Method:** Cancel ALL discretionary subscriptions (Netflix, gym, magazines, cable). Buy only what you need a la carte.
- Works for three reasons:
  1. **You're probably overpaying already** — gym members overestimate usage by 70%+. $70/month fee, 4.3 visits = $17/visit. Better to buy $10 day passes.
  2. **Forces conscious spending** — each $2.99 TV episode purchase makes you *think* about it (vs. passively paying cable bill)
  3. **You value what you pay for** — out-of-pocket feels more "real" than subscription
- **Downside:** Requires de-automating your life. Try it for 2 months. If you hate it, go back to subscriptions.
- **How to implement:** (1) Calculate last month's subscription spending, (2) Cancel and buy a la carte, (3) After 1 month, compare spending, (4) Get prescriptive: spent $100? Cut to $90, then $75.

### Guilt-Free Spending Money (20-35% of take-home)
- The fun bucket — restaurants, bars, taxis, movies, vacations
- This is the reward for handling the other three buckets first

### Optimizing Your Conscious Spending Plan

#### Go for Big Wins
- 80/20 analysis: 80% of overspending comes from ~20% of expenditures
- Focus on 2-3 variable "Big Win" areas (eating out, travel, clothes) instead of cutting 5% across dozens of small categories
- Most expenses are predictable month to month. Don't agonize over a $12 movie ticket. Zoom in on the 2-3 areas that vary wildly.

#### My Tools of the Trade
- **Mint (mint.com):** Auto-syncs with banks/credit cards, categorizes spending. Good starting point but has limitations (Intuit let it deteriorate).
- **YNAB (youneedabudget.com):** Assigns every dollar a "job." More prescriptive than Mint. Use for just two weeks for incredible insight.
- **Personal Capital:** Bird's-eye view of all investments and asset allocation.
- **Vanguard:** For investing / asset allocation tracking. Major brokerages let you add outside investments.
- **myfico.com:** Credit score and report (annual check).
- **bankrate.com:** Investment scenario calculators.
- **optoutprescreen.com:** Opt out of credit card offers. **Catalog Choice (catalogchoice.org):** Stop unwanted mail catalogs.
- As net worth grows: enlist a "Personal CFO" to report key numbers monthly.
- Minimize cash spending — use credit card for everything so spending is auto-tracked. Record average monthly cash spend as a line item.

#### Brian's Example ($48K/year take-home = $4,000/month)
- Fixed costs (60%): $2,400 | Investments (10%): $400 | Savings (10%): $400 | Guilt-free (20%): $800
- Problem: $800 guilt-free isn't enough — actually needs $1,050/month
- **Bad answer:** Shrug and do nothing
- **Slightly better:** Cut investments/savings (costs long-term)
- **Good answer:** Optimize the Big Wins:
  1. Negotiate lower credit card APR (18% → 15%): saves $1,357 in interest over life of $3K debt, saves 53 months of payments
  2. Cancel unused subscriptions (Netflix + Star Wars site = $60/month saved)
  3. Use YNAB to ratchet down eating out ($350) + bars ($250) = $600 → $400/month over 3 months
  - **Total saved: $260/month** — Conscious Spending Plan now works

#### Set Realistic Goals
- Don't go from zero to extreme (like cutting calories 50% + working out 5x/week overnight). You'll burn out in 3 weeks.
- Sustainable change: make bite-sized incremental changes
- **Example:** Cut eating out spending in half over 6 months: $500 → $475 → $450 → $400 → $350 → $300 → $250
- "I'd rather have people cut their spending by 10 percent and sustain it for thirty years than cut 50 percent for just a month."

#### Big Win: No More Fees
- Schoolteacher girlfriend's overdraft fees: estimated $100-200/year, actual = $1,300/year. Simply eliminating overdraft fees was her Big Win.
- Extreme change rarely lasts. Going from $500/week spending to $5/week → behavioral change won't stick.

### Use the Envelope System to Target Your Big Wins
- Allocate money to spending categories (envelopes). When envelope is empty, done for the month.
- Can be literal cash envelopes, YNAB categories, or Excel
- Can transfer between envelopes, but total spending doesn't increase
- **Tip:** Set up separate debit account for discretionary spending. Transfer $200/month. When it's gone, it's gone. Tell bank: don't allow overdraft.
- One reader tracked Big Wins with a table:

| | Eating Out | Taxis | Books |
|---|---|---|---|
| Times/month | 12 | 8 | 5 |
| Amount/event | $23 | $9 | $17 |

- Cut spending 43% in under 8 months by tracking quantity and amount per category

### What If You Don't Make Enough Money?
- "There's a limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn."
- Some people genuinely can't cut more. Conscious Spending Plan = theoretical guide, but the real focus should be **earning more**.
- Three strategies to earn more:

#### 1. Negotiate a Raise
- SHRM: average cost per hire = $4,425. Company already invested thousands in you.
- **Don't do what Jamie did:** Seethed silently for months, then timidly asked "Do you think I might possibly ask you about a raise?" — boss brushed him off.
- It's not about you needing more money. It's about demonstrating your value.
- **Timeline:**
  - **3-6 months before review:** Become top performer. Set expectations with boss, then exceed them.
  - **1-2 months before:** Prepare "briefcase" of evidence — concrete results, quantified impact.
  - **2 weeks before:** Practice negotiation with friends. Role-play extensively.
  - **1 month before:** Mention you'd like to discuss compensation. Ask what to bring. Get coworkers to put in a good word.
- **Boss objections and responses:**
  - "You didn't hit those goals" → "On [date], we agreed to these goals. I've sent weekly updates and exceeded them. I want to be compensated in good faith."
  - "I didn't agree to a raise" → "On [date], we agreed that hitting goals = top performer and we'd discuss compensation." (Pull out email chain.)
  - "We can discuss this another time" → "I understand timelines, but I've put in six months and updated you along the way. I'd like to get clear — in writing — that I'm on track for a raise next cycle."
- On negotiation day: bring salary data from salary.com and payscale.com, your accomplishments list, and frame it as "How do we make this work?"
- **Quick salary trick:** Hourly rate × 2 + three zeros = annual salary ($20/hr ≈ $40K). Reverse: salary ÷ 2, drop three zeros ($50K ≈ $25/hr).

#### 2. Get a Higher-Paying Job
- During the hiring process you have maximum leverage to negotiate salary.

#### 3. Do Freelance Work
- Think beyond Uber — what skills do others value? Babysitting, tutoring, dog walking, virtual assistant (upwork.com)
- Ramit's course Earn1K: students turned skills into businesses (teaching men to dance → *Good Morning America* feature; caricature artist $8/hr → six-figure business)
- In high school, Ramit emailed 50 companies offering to rewrite their websites. 15 responded. Got promoted to run sales department.
- In college, consulted for VCs on marketing/email/social media. Skills that seem basic to you can be very valuable to others.

### Maintaining Your Spending Plan
- Give yourself time to settle in. Get the basics down before optimizing (10% vs. 12% savings).
- Don't flip out over a few missed dollars. Use credit card for most purchases → auto-tracked.
- Minimize cash spending. Record average monthly cash as a Conscious Spending Plan line item.
- Track spending weekly — set aside 30 minutes every Sunday afternoon.

### How to Handle Unexpected and Irregular Expenses

| | Regular | Irregular |
|---|---|---|
| **Known** | Rent, loan payments, utilities | Christmas gifts, vehicle registration |
| **Unknown** | (gambling losses?) | Wedding gifts, medical expenses, traffic tickets |

- **Known irregular events:** Build into savings goals. $500 on Christmas gifts ÷ 12 = $42/month starting in January.
- **Unknown irregular events:** Add 15% buffer to fixed costs estimate. Also allocate $50+/month for "unexpected expenses" fund. Adjust amount as you learn your real pattern. Fun incentive: if money is left over at year-end, save half and spend half on something fun.

### The "Problem" of Extra Income
- **Unexpected one-time income** (birthday gift, tax return, freelance contract): Use 50% for fun, invest 50%. Keeps you motivated to pursue creative income.
- **Raises:** Much more important to handle correctly since they recur. Don't succumb to lifestyle inflation.
- Key rule for raises: $4,000 raise → take $1,000 and spend it on something memorable. Save/invest the remaining $3,000. Once you get accustomed to a lifestyle, you can never go back (Mercedes → Toyota Corolla? Never.).

> *"Working retail for five years I made a goal of saving up $10,000 to invest in the stock market... by putting half of every raise into my 401(k) plan. Every 4 percent raise was a 2 percent raise to my retirement plan."* — Jason Henry, 33

### The Beauty of a Conscious Spending Plan
- The plan guides your decisions for you: "Sorry, it's not in my plan this month" — no guilt, no stress.
- Most people go through life with a gnawing sense they "should" do something about money — tomorrow. Most don't think about saving until their mid-forties.
- Setting up a simple system makes the tough decisions up front, then you spend guilt-free.

### Week Four Action Steps
1. **Get your paycheck and create your Conscious Spending Plan** (30 min) — break take-home into: fixed costs (50-60%), investments (10%), savings (5-10%), guilt-free spending (20-35%)
2. **Optimize your spending** (2 hours) — dig into savings goals and fixed costs. Try the A La Carte Method. Break irregular expenses into monthly chunks.
3. **Pick your Big Wins** (5 hours) — open YNAB or Personal Capital account. Which 1-2 Big Wins will you target to cut $200/month? Start using envelope system.
4. **Maintain your Conscious Spending Plan** (1 hour/week) — enter cash receipts weekly. Tweak percentages. Make it realistic and sustainable for the long term.

# BATCH 9: Pages 231-250 (Chapter 5: Save While Sleeping — Automation)

## Chapter 5: Save While Sleeping
*Making your accounts work together — automatically*

### The Case for Automation
- Automating your money = the single most profitable system you'll ever build
- Ramit built his automated personal finance system 15+ years ago. It runs in the background every day, generating more money, requiring almost no time to maintain.
- Play offense: build a system that acknowledges human nature (bored, distracted, unmotivated) and uses technology to ensure you're still growing money.
- "Do the work now and benefit forever — automatically!"
- Works for irregular/freelance income too (Ramit covers this separately)

> *"I automated most of my finances so that I didn't really need to worry about budgeting each month. The biggest accomplishment for me is not having to think about finances each week."* — Jenna Christensen, 26

### Do More Before Doing Less
- **The Curve of Doing More Before Doing Less:** Front-load effort (getting set up) → coast happily forever → doing nothing (except worrying) is the alternative
- A few hours of setup now = spending a few hours up front saves huge amounts of time over the long term
- No more worrying about paying bills or going overdrawn. Money becomes a tool, not manual drudgery.

> *"I read the book at 23, when I had $17,000 in savings. I set up a robust system of automated savings for long-term goals... ten years later, I have $170,000 saved."* — Lisa Lunsford, 33

### The Power of Defaults
- People are lazy and will do whatever requires no work — often at their own financial expense (not taking 401(k) match = losing thousands/year from inaction).
- In two weeks you won't care about managing money anymore. You'll be back on Twitter and Netflix. Nobody really cares about managing their money.
- Solution: make money management happen **by default**. Set up automatic contributions. Once set up, it's actually harder to stop than to keep going (you're lazy, remember?).
- "If you got eaten alive by a Komodo dragon, your money system would continue transferring money from account to account by default."

> *"If you want to build wealth over your lifetime, the only sure way to do it is to get your plan on autopilot and make everything that's financially important in your life automatic."* — David Bach, author of *The Automatic Millionaire*

### How to Spend Only 90 Minutes a Month Managing Your Money
- Chapter 4: Conscious Spending Plan = the blueprint. Now automate it.
- **The Next $100 concept:** Where will the next $100 you make go? Most people shrug → money gets thoughtlessly spent. With your plan: $60 to fixed costs, $10 investments, $10 savings, $20 spending.

### Michelle's Example (Automatic Money Flow)
- Paid once a month. Employer auto-deducts 5% to 401(k).
- Rest goes to checking account via direct deposit.
- **Day after payday:** Checking auto-transfers: 5% → Roth IRA, 2% → wedding savings, 2% → house down payment, 1% → vacation savings = 5% total to savings goals
- Bills auto-paid by credit card (subscriptions, gym). Non-credit-card bills (rent, utilities, loans) paid from checking.
- Credit card auto-emails bill for 5-min review → auto-paid in full from checking.
- Whatever remains in checking = guilt-free spending money.
- Big Wins tracked in YNAB (eating out, clothes). Alerts set for overspending. Keeps $500 buffer in checking.
- Mid-month calendar reminder: check if within spending limits. If over, 15 days to course correct.
- **End result:** <2 hours/month monitoring. Invested 10%, saved 5%, all bills paid on time, credit card paid in full, spent exactly what she wanted. Had to say "no" only once — no big deal.

### Common Invisible Scripts on Automation

| "I feel like I have more control investing manually" | Have you actually invested consistently every month? Does all your money go where it should? Do you auto-rebalance? If no → you've lost money. Let's fix that. |
|---|---|
| "I only have a little money to start with" | Start now. Build the habit. As income increases, your system grows with you. |
| "I manually invest based on variable income" | Irregular income can be handled with this automation system. |
| "I don't know how" | Nothing wrong with not knowing. Read on. |
| "The fees are lower when I do it myself / I want more control" | Feelings aren't always right. Automating gives you more time, more money, and higher investment returns. |

### Create Your Automatic Money Flow

#### Link Your Accounts
- Look for "Link Accounts," "Transfer," or "Set Up Payments" in each account
- **Links to make:**
  1. Paycheck → 401(k) (if not already)
  2. Checking → Savings account
  3. Checking → Investment account/Roth IRA (initiate from investment account side)
  4. Credit card → any bills currently paid from checking (switch bills to credit card for points + tracking)
  5. Rent and loans that can't go on credit card → pay from checking (use company's website or bank bill-pay)
  6. All credit cards → auto-paid from checking account

#### Automating Your Money: The Flow
```
Salary → 401(k) [5%]
       → Checking Account [95%]
            → Roth IRA [5%]
            → Savings [5%] (wedding 2%, house 2%, vacation 1%)
            → Credit Card (regular bills, Netflix, gym, guilt-free spending)
            → Miscellaneous Bills (rent, utilities — can't be paid on credit card)
```

#### How to Connect Your Accounts

| Account | Should Fund |
|---|---|
| **Paycheck** | 401(k) + Checking (direct deposit) |
| **Checking** | Roth IRA, Savings (subdivided into goals), Credit card, Fixed costs that don't take credit card (rent), Occasional cash |
| **Credit Card** | Fixed costs + Guilt-free spending |

- If landlord doesn't have a payment website, use your bank's **bill-pay feature** (free with most accounts). Bank writes and mails a check for you. Schedule ahead for postal service timing.

#### Set Up Your Automatic Transfers
- **Sync all bills to the same schedule.** Call each company and switch billing dates to around the 1st of the month. Takes 5 minutes each. May take a couple months to fully adjust.
- **Transfer timeline (assuming paid on the 1st):**
  - **2nd of the month:** Paycheck arrives. Part goes to 401(k) automatically. Rest direct-deposited to checking. First time setup tip: leave a $500 buffer in checking in case a transfer goes wrong. Cash it out after a couple months.
  - **5th of the month:** Auto-transfer checking → savings account (5-10% of monthly income per your Conscious Spending Plan). Even if you can't afford much, start with $5 to prove the system works.
  - **5th of the month:** Auto-transfer checking → Roth IRA/investment account (~10% of take-home minus 401(k) contribution).
  - **7th of the month:** Auto-pay all monthly bills (cable, utilities, car payment, student loans) via credit card. If merchant doesn't accept credit card, set up auto-pay from checking.
  - **7th of the month:** Auto-pay credit card bill in full from checking. (Bill arrived on the 1st, so paying on 7th = never late.) If you have credit card debt, set up auto-pay for the minimum or a fixed amount.

### When the Money Flows (Summary Table)

| Date | Actions |
|---|---|
| 1st of the month | Salary direct-deposited into checking account |
| 2nd of the month | Part of salary goes into 401(k) |
| 5th of the month | Auto-transfer checking → savings account; Auto-transfer checking → Roth IRA |
| 7th of the month | Auto-payment of bills from checking and credit card; Auto-transfer checking → pay off credit card bill |

- Set up email notification from credit card to review bill before auto-pay hits checking
- Review bill to catch unexpected charges that exceed checking balance

### Review Your Credit Card Bill
- Pay with credit card as much as possible: auto-downloads transactions, categorizes spending, travel points, extra consumer protection, free warranty extensions
- **Early days check**: Weekly 5-minute review of charges on credit card. If no action needed, credit card auto-paid in full from checking at end of month. If error found, call credit card company to fix.
- **Weekly receipt check**: Keep restaurant receipts in a folder. Every Sunday, 5 minutes comparing receipts to credit card website (Ctrl+F for amounts). Catches added tips or fraudulent charges. Ask yourself: **WWAID?** (What Would An Indian Do?) — call the credit card company.
- **How Ramit checks now**: No more weekly reviews. With experience, you spot unusual deviations intuitively. Some small things slip through the cracks — that's okay. Focus on the big picture, not every $5 discrepancy.

### Tweaking the System for You

#### If You're Paid Twice a Month
- Replicate the system on the 1st and the 15th, with half the amounts each time
- Option 1: First paycheck pays bills, second paycheck funds savings/investing
- Option 2: Do half of all payments with each paycheck (can get clunky)
- Option 3: Save a "buffer" of money (e.g., $6,000 if take-home is $4,000/month or $2,000 bimonthly) in checking to simulate getting paid once a month, even if you get paid bimonthly

#### If You Have Irregular Income (Freelancers)
- System accommodates irregular income with one extra step
- **Step 1**: Figure out bare-bones monthly survival number (rent, utilities, food, loan payments)
- **Step 2**: Add a savings goal of 3 months' bare-bones income to your Conscious Spending Plan before investing. Example: $3,500/month minimum → need $10,500 buffer in savings.
- **Step 3**: Fund it. Forget investing while building the buffer. Redirect all "investment" money to savings. In good months, extra money → buffer savings.
- **Step 4**: Once 3 months buffered (stretch goal: 6 months), you've simulated stable income. Bad month = $0 earned, but buffer covers expenses. Good month = rebuild toward 3-6 month goal.
- **Step 5**: Return to normal Conscious Spending Plan with money flowing to investing accounts.
- Self-employed? No traditional 401(k) → look into **Solo 401(k)** and **SEP-IRA**. Sock away extra in savings during good months.

#### Freelancer Tax Note
- Self-employed = responsible for self-employment tax (employer normally handles this)
- **Rule of thumb: Set aside 40% of income for taxes** (Ramit prefers conservative; some save 30%)
- Better to oversave and get a refund than owe at year-end
- Hire a bookkeeper. Automate quarterly tax payments. Use YNAB for irregular income planning.

### When Do I Get to Spend My Money?
- Once automatic infrastructure is set up and money flows to investing, savings, and bills each month, **whatever remains in checking = guilt-free spending**
- The only people who ask "when do I get to spend?" are the rare ones concerned about saving *too much*
- Answer: Once you're hitting your saving/investing targets, **absolutely spend your leftover money**. Look at savings goals — if no "vacation" or "new snowboard" category, maybe add one.
- **Invest in yourself**: Travel, conferences, networking budgets — the return on investing in yourself is limitless
- If meeting all goals, increase guilt-free spending allocation
- **Philanthropy**: One of the best returns Ramit has gotten. Volunteer time, donate to causes. Give back to community.
- Saving too much is a good problem — and there are great solutions

### Your Money Is Now Automatic
- Three reasons the system works:

**1. Takes advantage of human psychology.** You'll get busy and distracted in 3 months. Your system keeps growing money by default.

**2. Your system will grow with you.** Start at $100/month. Get raises, tax refunds, side income → scale to $10,000/month or more. System still works beautifully.

**3. Your system lets you go from "hot" to "cool."** Removes you from daily emotional micro-decisions. No more "struggle," "resist," "guilty" about spending. Money becomes about all the good things it can do.

- "Show me someone's calendar and their spending, and I'll show you their priorities."
- Ramit's example: cashmere sweatpants that are "ridiculously" expensive. In context of a full automation system with saving and investing handled, they're simply a guilt-free purchase.
- **Use money for memories and experiences**: Ramit invited both sets of parents on his honeymoon to Italy — food tours, cooking classes, wine tastings. Made a few changes to Automatic Money Flow, money was redirected automatically.

> *"The automated investing principles have made saving so much easier. I used to debate which stock to buy, how much, limit prices, etc. I was spending a lot of mental energy on these tasks, and probably still being beaten regularly by the market. I have a managed investment account as well, and the automation has beat the managed account for the last eight years running."* — Ryan Lett, 38

> *"I automated my finances, and over seven years I have saved around $400,000. I also earned enough to max out my retirement accounts."* — Dan Shultz, 35

### Week Five Action Steps
1. **List all your accounts in one place** (1 hour) — Get all login info accessible from home and work.
2. **Link your accounts together** (3-5 days) — Connect all accounts. Allow 3-5 days for verification.
3. **Set up your Automatic Money Flow** (5 hours) — Set up automatic payments: money flows to investing, savings, fixed costs, and guilt-free spending. Reset billing cycles for well-timed flow.

# BATCH 10: Pages 265-270 (Chapter 6: The Myth of Financial Expertise)

## Chapter 6: The Myth of Financial Expertise
*Why professional wine tasters and stock pickers are clueless — and how you can beat them*

### The Wine Experiment
- Frederic Brochet (University of Bordeaux, 2001): 57 recognized wine experts evaluated a "red" and a "white" wine
- Experts described the red as "intense," "deep," "spicy" and the white as "lively," "fresh," "floral"
- Both wines were **exactly the same white wine** — the "red" had been tinted with food coloring
- 57 experts couldn't tell they were drinking identical wines
- **Lesson**: We defer to "experts" our whole lives — teachers, doctors, investment professionals. But expertise is ultimately about *results*, not credentials.

### The State of Financial Literacy
- High school students answered only 61% correctly on the National Financial Literacy test; college students got 69%
- We think "investing" = guessing the next best stock. It's not.
- When overwhelmed by options (small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, REITs, bonds, growth, value, blend, expense ratios, allocation, diversification), people say "Can't I just hire someone?"
- **Problem**: Financial experts — fund managers, pundits, anyone who tries to predict the market — are often *no better* than amateurs. In fact, they're often *worse*.
- The vast majority of people can earn more than the "experts" by investing on their own in low-cost funds
- Being rich is within *your* control, not some expert's

### Experts Can't Guess Where the Market Is Going
- Pundits and portfolio managers love forecasting ("timing the market") — but they simply cannot predict direction, highs, or lows
- Media feeds off every fluctuation: doom one day, euphoria three days later. None of it is actionable.
- **Key takeaway: Completely ignore any predictions pundits make.** They don't know what will happen.
- Mutual funds "turn over" stocks frequently → trading fees + taxes for you. Managers chase hot stocks, demand extraordinary compensation.
- **Fund managers fail to beat the market 75% of the time**
- S&P Dow Jones Indices (16-year study): fund managers who beat benchmarks one year had an extremely difficult time repeating the next year. "Less than a coin flip" chance of beating the index again.
- **Domino's vs. Google**: $1,000 in Google in Jan 2008 → ~$3,000 in 10 years. $1,000 in Domino's Pizza → almost **$18,000**. Nobody can consistently pick the winners.
- Anyone who claims they can consistently guess which stocks will outperform is lying
- **Judge a fund by 10+ years of track record**, not 1-2 years of performance

### A Startling Example of How "Experts" Can't Time the Market
- Putnam Investments: S&P 500 over 15 years, annualized return = 7.7%
- If you missed the **10 best days**: return drops from 7.7% to 2.96%
- If you missed the **30 best days**: return drops to **-2.47%** (negative!)
- $10,000 invested for 15 years = $30,711. Miss 10 best days = $15,481. Miss 30 best days = $6,873 (less than you started with!)
- **"Focus on time IN the market, not timing the market."**

### How Financial Experts Hide Poor Performance

#### Never Admitting They Were Wrong
- Daniel Solin (*The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read*): Financial ratings companies like Morningstar continue giving "buy" or "hold" ratings even as companies crater and file for bankruptcy
- **47 of 50 advisory firms** continued advising "buy or hold" up to the date companies filed for bankruptcy
- **12 of 19 companies** continued receiving "buy" or "hold" on the actual date they filed

#### Morningstar's Five-Star Ratings Are Nonsense
- Researchers Christopher Blake and Matthew Morey: Low-star ratings predicted poor performance, but **high-star ratings did NOT predict future success**
- "There is little statistical evidence that Morningstar's highest-rated funds outperform the next-to-highest and median-rated fund"
- Five stars ≠ future performance

#### Survivorship Bias
- Funds that fail are not included in future performance studies — they simply disappear
- Company starts 100 funds, 50 fail → company trumpets the surviving 50 and ignores the dead ones
- "Best 10 Funds!" lists only show funds that didn't close down. Of *course* some will have five stars.
- **Burton Malkiel (*A Random Walk Down Wall Street*)**: Mutual fund complexes use "incubator funds" — start 10, wait a few years, market the 3 that outperformed, drop the other 7 and bury their records.

### Three Legendary Investors Who Did Beat the Market
- **Warren Buffett**: 20.9% annualized return over 53 years
- **Peter Lynch** (Fidelity): 29% over 13 years
- **David Swensen** (Yale endowment): 13.5% over 33 years
- These are extreme outliers with phenomenal skill, top-notch professional resources, and access to investments retail investors will never have (venture capital, hedge funds, proprietary deals)
- Even Swensen himself says individual investors shouldn't expect to equal his returns
- Theoretically *possible* to beat the market, just as it's *possible* for Ramit to become a heavyweight boxing champion — statistically, a few will. But is it skill or luck?

### How to Engineer a Perfect Stock-Picking Record (Probability Trick)
- Scammer emails 10,000 people: half told Stock A will go up, half told Stock B
- Stock A goes up → he drops the Stock B group, focuses on the 5,000 who saw a "correct" pick
- Splits again: 2,500 told Stock C, 2,500 told Stock D. Whichever is right, 2,500 people have now seen two correct picks
- After a few rounds, 1,250+ people have seen multiple "correct" picks and are awed by his "ability"
- **Moral**: Don't trust purported financial expertise just because of a few impressive stats. Same applies to "five-star funds."

### I Bet You Don't Need a Financial Adviser
- "But I don't have time to invest!" — the outsourcing argument. We outsource car cleaning, laundry, housekeeping. Why not money?
- Most young people have simple finances. A few hours a week over 6 weeks = automatic personal finance infrastructure. No adviser needed.
- **Financial advisers don't always look out for your interests.** They're supposed to help you, but they're not obligated to do what's *best* for you. Commission-based advisers will direct you to expensive, bloated funds to earn their commissions.

> *"At my first job, my company offered seminars hosted by a former employee who was now doing investments. He gave pretty standard advice (save in your 401(k), use a Roth IRA, etc.). I went for a consult and set up a Roth IRA with him. He also sold me on the investment advantages of whole life insurance policies. Then my wife looked at the details and said, 'Ummm... nope.' She called them up to cancel everything and get our money back. We got everything back, which was good, because initial outlays were almost five figures. Around that time, I got your book and moved my Roth from him to Vanguard... Haven't looked back since."* — Tom T., 35

### My Friend Realizes His Financial Adviser Has Been Taking Him for a Ride
- Ramit's friend Joe (young entrepreneur, high earnings) was being sold "whole life insurance," "annuities," and "primerica" products
- **Red flags**: "whole life insurance," "annuities," "primerica" = at best overpaying, at worst being scammed
- The fees would be hundreds of thousands (or even $1,000,000+) over a lifetime
- Ramit advised: move everything to a low-cost broker. Communicate in writing because adviser will use emotional manipulation.
- Adviser's response: "shocked," tried guilt-tripping ("taking on all your planning doesn't seem like a good idea"), even offered to "list out instructions to close your accounts" (reverse psychology)
- Joe refused to be baited: "I'm not confident some of the decisions we made together were truly in my best interest."
- **Ask your adviser: Are you a fiduciary?** (Required to put your financial interests first.) Joe's adviser was NOT a fiduciary — he was a salesman. That's why he recommended a single man in his twenties buy life insurance (only needed if you have dependents).
- **If your adviser isn't a fiduciary, switch.** Don't worry about emotional tactics. Keep your eye on the prize.
- **Fee-only advisers** charge a flat fee, not commissions. More reputable. Neither is necessarily better at returns, but they charge differently (affecting your bottom line).

### When Do You Actually Need a Financial Adviser?
- **Most people don't need one.** You can do it all yourself with this book.
- If your choice is between hiring an adviser or not investing at all, **hire one** — it's better to pay a little and invest than to do nothing.
- **Hire a fee-only adviser if**: you have a really complex situation, inherited/accumulated $2M+, or are truly too busy to learn
- Search at **napfa.org** — National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (fee-based, hourly rate, not commission)
- Many people use advisers as a crutch, paying tens of thousands over a lifetime because they didn't spend a few hours learning

> *"I lucked into a one-time windfall and tried to do the 'smart thing' by using a financial planner recommended by my bank. He put me in terrible funds that both underperformed the S&P 500 AND had insane fees. Lost about 30 percent of my money. Eventually moved everything to Vanguard Index Funds. No regrets about the move. Nothing but regrets about the wasted time and money 'trusting a professional.'"* — Dave Nelson, 40

### So You Really Think You Need a Financial Adviser? (Template Email)
- Send introductory email to a fee-only planner from napfa.org
- Include: total assets, account types (Roth IRA, 401(k), cash), goals (maximize long-term returns, minimize costs)
- Request a 30-minute meeting (shouldn't cost anything)
- **Three questions to ask at minimum:**
  1. Are you a fiduciary? How do you make your money — commission or fee-only? Any other fees? (Any answer other than clear "yes" to fiduciary = instant no-hire)
  2. Have you worked with people in similar situations? What do you recommend? (Get references and call them.)
  3. What's your working style? Do we talk regularly? What to expect in first 30, 60, 90 days?

### When Two Wealth Managers Tried to Recruit Me
- Friend insisted Ramit talk to wealth managers (turned out to be from Wells Fargo Private Wealth Management)
- **Wells Fargo and Bank of America are terrible**: extortionate fees, deceptive practices, beat down average consumers
- Wealth managers: find rich person → ask questions → plan finances → charge 1-2% of assets. Also offer "prestige services" (portfolio analysis, international mortgages, tax planning).
- Ramit role-played as naive prospect. They didn't research him at all.
- They pitched: "We work with entrepreneurs and celebrities" (celebrities are targets because they have money for a short time and want to delegate)
- Sales tactics: "We help you focus on your work," "We keep your money safe," playing on fear of loss
- **"We focus on asset preservation"** = "Our investment returns will be below what you could get from a cheap Vanguard fund." Translation: "You can buy salt for $1. We will give you worse salt and charge you $2. But we'll deliver it on a beautiful leather tray every six months."
- **The 1% fee reality**: Over time, a 1% fee can reduce returns by ~28-30%. A 2% fee can cost ~63% of potential returns. $100,000 invested with their 1% fee → $2.1M becomes $1.5M — **$600,000 goes into their pocket.**
- 1% can cost 28% of returns. 2% can cost 63% of returns. This is why Wall Street is so rich.
- **You should be paying 0.1% to 0.3% in fees, not 1-2%.**

### Takeaways from the Wealth Manager Story
1. Role-playing with "experts" is one of the best things you can do
2. The vast majority don't need a wealth manager or financial adviser. This book works.
3. Wealth managers know they can't beat the market, so they "add value" in other ways: taxes, wills, trusts, insurance. Legit services — but none require a commission-based adviser. Don't make fear-based decisions.
4. Once you have seven figures, complex transactions, kids, retirement, or taxes to manage — consider hiring a **fee-only** adviser for a few hours.

### Active vs. Passive Management
- Investing is NOT a waste of money — you just have to know *where* to invest
- **Mutual funds** = collections of different investments (stocks, bonds). Simplest way for most people to invest. But fund managers fail to beat the market 75% of the time, and fees are large.
- **Active management**: Portfolio manager actively picks stocks. Charges 1-2% expense ratio. Trades frequently → fees + taxes. Makes human mistakes (selling too quickly, trading too much, chasing hot stocks). Trades frequently to show short-term results.
- **Passive management (index funds)**: Computer replaces the portfolio manager. Simply buys the same stocks as an index (e.g., S&P 500 = 500 largest US stocks). No attempt to pick winners. Much lower fees (Vanguard S&P 500 index fund = 0.14% expense ratio).
- Index funds track the market: if market falls 10%, fund falls 10%. If market gains 18%, fund gains 18%. Big difference = much lower fees.
- All kinds of index funds: international, healthcare, small-cap, total US stock market.
- Over the long term, the stock market has returned ~8% after inflation.

### Fees Comparison: Index Fund vs. Actively Managed Fund

**$100/month investment, 8% return:**

| Time | Index Fund (0.14%) | Mutual Fund (1%) | Extra Fees Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 years | $7,321 | $7,159 | $162 |
| 10 years | $18,152 | $17,308 | $844 |
| 25 years | $92,967 | $81,007 | **$11,960** |

**$5,000 initial + $1,000/month, 8% return:**

| Time | Index Fund (0.14%) | Mutual Fund (1%) | Extra Fees Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 years | $80,607 | $78,681 | $1,926 |
| 10 years | $192,469 | $183,133 | $9,336 |
| 25 years | $965,117 | $838,699 | **$126,419** |

- **John Bogle (Vanguard founder, PBS *Frontline*)**: Two people invest identically for 50 years, one pays 2% more in fees. The high-fee portfolio loses **63% of its potential returns** to fees.
- 1% fee over 50 years = 39% of returns lost. Over 35 years = 28% reduction (per Department of Labor).
- **Fees are your enemy in investing.**

### Returns: Active Funds Rarely Beat the Market
- Mutual funds do occasionally provide great returns — a fund focused on Indian stocks might return 70% in a good year
- But 1-2 years of great performance means nothing. What matters is **after-tax, after-fee returns over 10, 15, and 20 years.**
- Ask any broker: "What were your after-tax, after-fee returns for the last ten, fifteen, and twenty years?" They won't give a straight answer.
- **Professor Edward O'Neal** (Babcock/Wake Forest School of Business): Tracked funds whose sole purpose was to beat the market.
  - 1993-1998: Less than half beat the market
  - 1998-2003: Only 8% beat the market
  - Funds that beat the market in **both** periods: only **2% of all large-cap funds**
- "Investors, both individual and institutional, and particularly 401(k) plans, would be far better served by investing in passive or passively managed funds."
- No reason to pay exorbitant fees for active management when you can do better, for cheaper, on your own.

### Chapter 6 Summary
- This chapter is strictly informational — no Action Steps. The next chapter covers the technical aspects of selecting and automating investments.

### Invisible Adviser Scripts

| Script | What It Means |
|---|---|
| "I don't know, I just want to pay someone to take it off my hands." | It's natural to be intimidated, but this is *your* money. Learning the fundamentals is the most profitable decision you'll make. Jim Rohn: "Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better." Build discipline, like an adult. |
| "I like him. He's really trustworthy. Also, my dad used him." | We conflate "likable" with "trustworthy." University of Chicago study: "US doctors are judged more on bedside manner than effectiveness of care." Your adviser might be likable — but focus on results. |
| "I'm afraid of losing money." | Every dollar you pay an adviser in fees is a dollar you could have invested. A 1% fee can reduce returns by ~30%. |
| "My guy has beaten the market the last four years." | Maybe. More likely he hasn't once you factor in all fees and taxes (which he'll naturally obscure). Research shows past hot performance doesn't predict future performance. |

# BATCH 12: Pages 293-310 (Chapter 7: Investing Isn't Only for Rich People)

## Chapter 7: Investing Isn't Only for Rich People
*Spend the afternoon picking a simple portfolio that will make you rich*

### Overview
- Now you'll learn how to choose your own investments, pay less in fees, and get superior performance
- Determine your investing style: Do you need the money next year? Can you withstand big day-to-day swings?
- "Investment portfolio" = all your investment accounts combined (401(k), Roth IRA, taxable accounts)
- Goal: pick the simplest investment to get started, make your portfolio easy to maintain

> *"I used the advice from IWT to set up my Schwab IRA, personal investment account, and checking account prior to starting my first job when I was twenty-four. I'm now thirty and have over $300,000 saved between my personal investment account, 401(k), and IRA."* — Smit Shah, 30

### A Better Way to Invest: Automatic Investing
- Combine a classic low-cost investing strategy with automation
- Recommended by Nobel Laureates, Warren Buffett, and most academics
- Spend most of your time choosing how money will be *distributed* in your portfolio (asset allocation), then pick investments (takes the least time), then automate regular contributions
- **Two reasons automatic investing works:**
  1. **Lower expenses**: Low-cost funds replace expensive portfolio managers. You save tens of thousands in trading fees, taxes, and investment expenses, thereby outperforming most investors.
  2. **It's automatic**: Frees you from paying attention to "hot stocks" or market micro-changes. Set up automatic contributions. You effectively trick yourself into investing. Focus on living your life — "Zen Investing for People Who Have Real Lives."

### Too Good to Be True?
- What happens when the market goes down? People with automatic plans in 2008 panicked, canceled investments, pulled money out. Big mistake.
- In Oct 2018, one of Ramit's accounts dropped $100,000+. He kept investing automatically, every single month.
- **It takes strength to know that when the market drops, you're getting shares on sale.** The best time to make money is when everyone else is getting out.

> *"I started investing about three years ago, after reading a bunch of finance books, including yours. I started pretty late, was almost thirty-one, but I feel pretty good about my progress. I'm maxing out my Roth, where I'm investing more aggressively, and also putting 15 percent in my 401(k) with Vanguard, all index funds."* — Joe Fruh, 34

- **Bottom line:** Automatic investing may not seem as sexy as trading hedge funds and biotech stocks, but it works a lot better. Would you rather be sexy or rich?

### Do You Believe Everything Your Friends Tell You?
- "My friends tell me investing is too risky and I could lose all my money."
- That's an emotional reaction, not a logical response. "Market Correction" and "Stock Drops 10% Overnight" headlines make it easy to practice the "Do Nothing Approach."
- People afraid of investing RIGHT NOW are usually the same ones who buy when prices are soaring. Warren Buffett: **"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."**
- A diversified portfolio means you won't lose everything
- Ask friends: What's the average return of the S&P 500 over 70 years? How much would $10,000 be worth in 10 or 50 years? They won't know — because they don't know the basics. When people say investing is "too risky," it's because they don't know what they don't know.

### The Magic of Financial Independence
- TV anchor asked Ramit: "So do you have to work anymore?" Ramit: "No, I don't have to work anymore." — the **Crossover Point**, where investments earn enough to fund all expenses automatically
- **Crossover Point** (from Vicki Robin & Joe Dominguez, *Your Money or Your Life*): When your money generates more money than your salary. You're "financially independent" (FI).
- What can you do? Wake up, spend three hours at brunch, go work out, see friends, practice hobbies. Choose to work, or not.

### FIRE: Financial Independence, Retire Early
- **FI**: Financial Independence — investments pay for your life in perpetuity
- **RE**: Retiring Early — often in your thirties or forties
- **FIRE**: FI + RE
- **LeanFire**: Live on ~$30,000-$50,000/year. Embrace simplicity, reject materialism.
- **FatFire**: Financially independent with extravagant lifestyle. Flying first class, Four Seasons, private school for three kids.

### How to Reach Your Crossover Point
- $80,000 household income, $6,000/month expenses. At 10% savings rate: crossover in 38 years. But you can get there faster.
- **Option 1: Cut expenses.** Live on $3,000/month ($36,000/year). LeanFire approach → crossover in ~12 years. (But you've targeted $36K/year spending.)
- **Option 2: Raise income.** Negotiate a 30% raise, invest all extra money → crossover in ~22 years. (But you keep $72K/year spending.)
- **Option 3: Both.** Increase income by 30% AND cut spending by 30% → crossover in **~9 years.** High spending ($72K/year) with an extremely short time to FI.
- Most people never think about earnings and spending in this way. They save a tiny amount, work for decades, rant about taxes on Twitter.

### Ramit's Take on FIRE
- **Positive**: FIRE obliterates the "save 10-20%" standard by showing 25%, 40%, even 70% is possible if you're clear about your goals
- **Negative**: Many FIRE adherents exhibit stress, anxiety, depression. They think hitting a number will solve their unhappiness. The /r/financialindependence subreddit is full of people obsessed with quitting their jobs ASAP.
- One Redditor: "I look back at the past few years of my life and at my bank account and I would gladly give away a hefty chunk of it and work longer if it meant I could have experienced more of the world and found more passions... I built my savings, but I never built my life."
- If people use words like "miserable," "rat race," and "anxiety" about their FIRE journey — that's a red flag.
- **Remember that life is lived outside the spreadsheet.** Be aggressive with goals, dream big — but money is just a small part of a Rich Life.

> *"I was afraid to get started with investing before reading the IWT book. I had a 401(k), but wasn't maxing it out, didn't have an IRA, and had no investments. My parents drilled scarcity mindsets into me growing up and were extremely risk averse. I finally set up a Roth IRA and have maxed it out every year. Last year I maxed out my 401(k) for the first time... Through the investment accounts, I've got over $100,000 growing for retirement, and $8,000 in the personal investment account."* — David Chambers, 35

### More Convenience or More Control: You Choose
- **Easy version**: Turn to the Target Date Fund section. One single investment, get started in a few hours.
- **Advanced version**: Read on to learn the building blocks of a portfolio and customize your own asset allocation.

### Investing Is Not About Picking Stocks
- Ask friends what investing means → "Picking stocks." Wrong. You cannot reliably pick stocks that outperform long-term.
- **The major predictor of your portfolio's volatility is NOT the individual stocks you pick, but your mix of stocks and bonds** (asset allocation)
- **Brinson, Hood, Beebower (1986, *Financial Analysts Journal*)**: More than **90% of your portfolio's volatility** is a result of your asset allocation
- *Your investment plan is more important than your actual investments.*
- By diversifying across different kinds of funds (not all in one stock), you won't have to worry about a single stock cutting your portfolio in half
- **Asset allocation = the most significant part of your portfolio that you can control**

> *"Since you cannot successfully time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of your investment strategy, because it is the only factor affecting your investment risk and return that you can control."* — William Bernstein, *The Four Pillars of Investing*

### The Building Blocks of Investing (Pyramid of Investing Options)

**Bottom: Stocks / Bonds / Cash** (most control, least convenient)
- **Stocks**: Buy shares of a company. High control, extremely unpredictable returns. Hard to choose and maintain individually.
- **Bonds**: IOUs from companies or government. Predictable returns, lower than stocks on average.
- **Cash**: Money sitting uninvested (money-market accounts). Safest, lowest return.

**Middle: Index Funds / Mutual Funds** (somewhat convenient)
- Can have low fees (index funds) or high fees (mutual funds)
- More control than target date funds, less than individual stocks/bonds
- Returns fairly predictable over the long term

**Top: Target Date Funds** (most convenient, least control)
- More predictable returns over the long term

#### Stocks
- Average stock market returns ~8%/year (after inflation) over the long term
- Individual stocks are less clear-cut: you could make huge returns or lose everything
- Snapchat stock plunged 9.5% in one day after a redesign announcement
- Even professionals who devour annual reports can't beat the market. What chance do you have picking individual stocks?
- **Don't invest in individual stocks. Choose funds instead** — collections of stocks (and sometimes bonds) that reduce risk through diversification.

#### Bonds
- IOUs from companies or government. You lend $100, they give you $103 back a year from now.
- Advantages: choose the term (2, 5, 10+ years), know exact payout at maturity, government bonds are extremely stable (only way to lose = government defaults on loans)
- Disadvantages: low returns compared to stocks, money is illiquid (locked away), early withdrawal = severe penalties
- **Who likes bonds?** Rich people (preservation of capital) and old people (stability, can't withstand volatility, need predictable income)
- Groucho Marx: "I keep my money in treasury bonds." "They don't make you much money!" "They do if you have enough of them."

#### Cash
- Money sitting on sidelines in money-market accounts. Safest part of portfolio, lowest reward.
- You actually lose money holding cash once you factor inflation.
- If you're contributing to savings goals (Chapter 5) and have an emergency fund, don't worry about having cash in your investment account.

### 90 Years of Average Annual Returns (Aswath Damodaran, NYU)

| Asset | Avg. Annual Return |
|---|---|
| Stocks | 11.5% |
| Bonds | 5.2% |
| Cash | 3.4% |

*(Returns are arithmetic mean/CAGR ~9.5%, do not include inflation, past is not predictor of future)*

- Higher risk = higher potential reward. Stocks return the most but dip 35% some years.
- You need a mix of asset classes — not all stocks (too volatile) or all bonds (too low-return).

### Asset Allocation: The Critical Factor That Most Investors Miss
- Diversifying within stocks only is like being the hottest person in Friendship, Wisconsin — modest competition
- It's more important to allocate *across* different asset classes (stocks AND bonds)
- **Diversification** = D = going deep into a category (large-cap, small-cap, international stocks)
- **Asset allocation** = A = going across all categories (stocks *and* bonds)

### Why Asset Allocation Matters
- One of the most important decisions you'll ever make — worth hundreds of thousands (even millions) to you
- Most people have never heard the phrase "asset allocation" — financial media thinks it's too complicated, resorts to vague words like "safety" and "growth"
- **Real-world consequences**: 50-60 year olds who saw catastrophic portfolio drops in the recession had improper asset allocation (all equities). They should have had bonds too. (And they shouldn't have sold during the downturn.)
- **Age and risk tolerance matter**: At 25, a mostly-stock portfolio makes sense (decades to recover from dips). At 60+, a sizable portion should be in stable bonds.
- Bonds act as counterweight to stocks — generally rising when stocks fall. A portfolio with bonds may actually have *better* overall performance because bonds lower risk a lot while only slightly limiting returns.
- In your twenties/early thirties, you don't necessarily need bonds — invest in all-stock funds and let time mitigate risk.
- In your thirties and older, begin balancing with bonds to reduce risk.
- **Suze Orman example**: Net worth ~$25M, houses worth $7M. Only $1M in stocks — rest in bonds. Personal finance world was "horrified." But she has ~25 million reasons not to take unnecessary risk. "Once you've won the game, there's no reason to take unnecessary risk."

### Stocks and Bonds Have Many Flavors

**Stock Types:**
| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Large-Cap | Companies with market cap over $10 billion |
| Mid-Cap | Companies with market cap $1-5 billion |
| Small-Cap | Companies with market cap under $1 billion |
| International | Stocks from other countries (emerging + developed markets) |
| Growth | Stocks expected to grow faster than the market |
| Value | Stocks that seem bargain-priced (cheaper than they should be) |

**Bond Types:**
| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Government | Ultra-safe, backed by government. Low risk, lower returns. |
| Corporate | Issued by corporations. Riskier than government, safer than stocks. |
| Short-Term | Terms under 3 years |
| Long-Term | Terms 10+ years, higher yields than short-term |
| Municipal | Issued by local governments ("munis") |
| Inflation-Protected (TIPS) | Treasury securities that protect against inflation |

- REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) don't neatly fit into stocks or bonds categories.

### The Importance of Being Diversified
- You need to own a little of all types of stocks and bonds — this is "diversifying"
- Large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international stocks each perform differently year to year. None performs consistently best.
- William Bernstein (*Skating Where the Puck Was*): "Resign yourself to the fact that diversifying yourself among risky assets provide[s] scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations, which can be far more destructive to wealth."
- **Diversification = safety in the long term**
- You should own different categories of stocks (and bonds) to balance your portfolio. If one category tanks for a decade, the others protect you.

### Typical Asset Allocations by Age (Vanguard Target Date Funds)
| Age | Stocks | Bonds |
|---|---|---|
| 35 | 90% | 10% |
| 45 | 90% | 10% |
| 55 | 69% | 31% |
| 65 | 53% | 47% |

- These are general rules of thumb. Some keep 100% stocks until their 30s-40s.
- In your twenties/thirties, time is on your side — be aggressive. Even if stocks drop, you have decades to recover.
- **Biggest danger for beginners**: Not that your portfolio is too risky. It's being lazy and overwhelmed and not doing any investing at all.

### Mutual Funds: Not Bad, Pretty Convenient, but Often Expensive and Unreliable
- Invented in 1924 — baskets of different stocks. Instead of picking individual stocks, pick a fund.
- Many types: large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, biotechnology, European, Asian stocks, etc.
- Extremely popular — provide instant diversification
- Most people's first encounter: their 401(k) options
- Been popular for 85+ years, a cash cow for Wall Street
- **Advantages**: Hands-off, expert picks stocks, diversified across many stocks
- **Disadvantages**: High fees (expense ratios 1-2%), front-end and back-end loads (sales charges), may overlap with other funds you own, and 75% of managers don't beat the market
- Active management can't compete with passive management. This leads us to index funds.

> *"I put my first chunk of money in an actively managed fund about a year before I read your book... It was a long-term investment, so it certainly made money, but when compared to a benchmark index fund, I missed out on some growth. I finally found myself at a point where paying capital gains tax made sense, so I've now been able to roll it into lower-cost investments."* — Anand Trivedi, 35

### Index Funds: The Attractive Cousin in an Otherwise Unattractive Family
- **1975**: John Bogle (Vanguard founder) introduced the world's first index fund
- Simple funds that buy stocks to match an index (e.g., S&P 500) instead of trying to beat it
- No attempts to beat the market. Computer automatically matches the index. Low cost, tax efficient, requires hardly any maintenance.
- Index funds are the financial equivalent of "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
- **Illusory superiority**: 93% of people rate themselves in the top 50% of drivers. Every mutual fund manager believes *he* can beat the market. Result: frequent trading → taxes + fees → worse-than-market returns for investors.
- Bogle discarded the old model and introduced index funds.
- Index funds simply match the market. In your 20s-30s, if the market drops, your index funds drop too. Expect it. Over the long term, the stock market has always gone up.
- **Wall Street is terrified of index funds** and tries to keep them under wraps with more marketing for mutual funds.

### Professionals Agree: Index Funds Are Great
> *"I believe that 98 or 99 percent — maybe more than 99 percent — of people who invest should extensively diversify and not trade. That leads them to an index fund with very low costs."* — **Warren Buffett**

> *"When you realize how few advisers have beaten the market over the last several decades, you may acquire the discipline to do something even better: become a long-term index fund investor."* — **Mark Hulbert**, former editor of *Hulbert Financial Digest*

> *"The media focuses on the temporarily winning active funds that score the more spectacular bull's eyes, not index funds that score every year and accumulate less flashy, but ultimately winning, scores."* — **W. Scott Simon**, author of *Index Mutual Funds*

### High Expense Ratios Cost More Than You Think

| Portfolio Size | Index Fund (0.14%) Annual Fee | Mutual Fund (1%) Annual Fee |
|---|---|---|
| $5,000 | $7 | $50 |
| $25,000 | $35 | $250 |
| $100,000 | $140 | $1,000 |
| $500,000 | $700 | $5,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $1,400 | $10,000 |

- **Advantages of index funds**: Extremely low cost, easy to maintain, tax efficient
- **Disadvantages**: To create comprehensive asset allocation, you typically need multiple index funds. You'll have to rebalance every 12-18 months. Each fund has a minimum investment (often waived with automatic monthly investing).
- Index funds are clearly superior to individual stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Great for people who want control over portfolio composition.
- But if you don't want to build and rebalance your own portfolio, there's an even easier option at the top of the pyramid: **target date funds**.

### Target Date Funds: Investing the Easy Way
- Ramit's favorite investment. Embody the 85 Percent Solution: not exactly perfect, but easy enough for anyone to get started.
- Simple funds that **automatically diversify your investments based on when you plan to retire**
- "Funds of funds" — a target date fund owns many other funds (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, international, bond funds), which in turn own many stocks and bonds
- **You only have to own ONE fund**, and all the rest is handled for you
- Start aggressive in your twenties, automatically shift to conservative as you age. **You do no work** except send money.
- If more Americans had owned target date funds during the 2008 recession, far fewer retirees would have seen catastrophic drops.
- Also called "target retirement" or "lifecycle" funds — same thing
- Minimums usually $1,000-$3,000 (often waived with automatic monthly investing)
- You can choose a fund for an older age if you're risk-averse (more conservative allocation)
- Not all created equal — some more expensive than others, but generally low cost and tax efficient

### The Rule of 72
- **Quick trick**: Divide 72 by your return rate = number of years to double your money
- 10% return → 72 ÷ 10 = ~7 years to double
- $5,000 at 10% → $10,000 in ~7 years → $20,000 in ~14 years → etc.

### Choosing and Actually Buying Your Investments
- You should invest in either a **target date fund** OR **index funds** (not individual stocks)
- If you want 85 Percent Solution convenience → target date fund
- If you're a finance geek who wants more control → index funds

### A Common Investment Option: Your 401(k)
- If employer offers a match, fund 401(k) before anything else
- Companies offer a few options: aggressive (mostly stocks), balanced (stocks + bonds), conservative (mostly bonds)
- Stay away from "money market funds" — that's just cash sitting uninvested
- As a young person, pick the most aggressive fund you're comfortable with
- 401(k) fund options may have higher expense ratios than you'd like (anything over 0.75% is expensive), but the tax advantages and employer match still make it worth it

### Investing Using Your Roth IRA
- After 401(k) match, Roth IRA is the next best place to invest
- Benefits: tax-free earnings growth, flexibility to choose any funds you want
- When you send money to your Roth IRA, it just sits there — you need to actually invest it
- Easiest investment: a target date fund. Buy it, set up automatic monthly contributions, forget about it.

### Choosing a Target Date Fund for Your Roth IRA
- Look for target date funds through Vanguard (recommended, though other solid companies exist)
- Vanguard offers "Target Retirement 2040," "Target Retirement 2045," "Target Retirement 2050," etc.
- **Pick the year closest to when you'll turn 65** (your expected retirement year)
- The larger the year number → the more stocks (more aggressive)
- Very low fees. Automatically reallocate over time. Do all the hard work for you.
- Also called "target date," "target retirement," or "lifecycle" funds — same thing.
- Minimums $1,000-$3,000 (often waived with automatic monthly investing)
- You can pick a fund for someone older than you if you're risk-averse

### Buying into Your Target Date Fund
1. Log in to your Roth IRA (opened in Chapter 3)
2. Have at least $1,000-$3,000 in cash to cover the fund minimum (some companies waive with $50-$100/month auto-invest)
3. Type in the ticker symbol for your target date fund (or search for it)
4. Click "buy"
5. Set up automatic monthly contributions

> *"Since reading IWT, I have probably saved and earned at least $70,000-plus over the past four years. This was accomplished by reading the 401(k) and Roth IRA (Vanguard) sections and investing in target date funds."* — Jenna Christensen, 26

---

## BATCH 14 (Pages 331-350)

### This Small Investing Mistake Cost Her $9,000
- IWT reader's friend had been contributing to her IRA for almost 10 years but it "barely increased"
- **The friend never selected funds** — she transferred money into the Roth IRA but never actually invested it. It just sat there as cash.
- The $3,000 she "invested" could have been worth more than $12,000. That's **$9,000 in effortless, tax-free money** lost.
- **A Roth IRA is just an account.** Once your money is in there, you have to start investing in different funds to see your money grow.

> *"I feel kind of cheated. I could have been earning more money for all of these years, yet no one ever told me about this important step."*

### So You Want to Do It on Your Own (Building an Index Fund Portfolio)
- For people who aren't satisfied with a target date fund and want to pick their own index funds
- **Warning**: Most people who try to manage their own portfolios fail at even matching the market. They sell at the first sign of trouble, or buy/sell too often, diminishing returns with taxes and fees.
- If you buy individual index funds, you'll have to **rebalance every year** to keep your asset allocation on target
- If you want more control and are disciplined enough to withstand market dips and rebalance annually, then building your own portfolio of index funds is the right choice

### David Swensen's Model Portfolio
- **David Swensen** = "the Beyoncé of money management." Runs **Yale's fabled endowment** for 30+ years
- Generated an astonishing **13.5% annualized return** (most managers can't even beat 8%)
- Has almost **doubled Yale's money every five years** from 1985 to today
- Stays at Yale because he loves academia: "When I see colleagues leave universities to do essentially the same thing they were doing but to get paid more, I am disappointed because there is a sense of mission."

**Swensen's Recommended Asset Allocation:**

| Asset Class | Allocation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Domestic equities | 30% | US stock funds (small-, mid-, large-cap) |
| Developed-world international equities | 15% | UK, Germany, France, etc. |
| Emerging-market equities | 5% | China, India, Brazil (riskier) |
| Real estate investment trusts (REITs) | 20% | Mortgages, residential/commercial real estate |
| Government bonds | 15% | Fixed-interest US securities, predictable income |
| Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) | 15% | Protect against inflation (buy last) |

- **Key takeaway**: No single choice represents an overwhelming part of the portfolio
- You can actually **reduce your risk while maintaining an equivalent return** through proper asset allocation

### Keep It Manageable: How Many Funds Should I Own?
- Ideally just **one** (a target date fund)
- If picking your own index funds: **3 to 7 funds** covering domestic equities, international equities, REITs, and a small bond allocation
- The goal isn't to be exhaustive and own every single aspect of the market — it's to create an effective asset allocation and move on with your life

### How to Pick Index Funds
1. **Minimize fees**: Look for expense ratios around **0.2% or lower**. Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity offer excellent value.
2. **Fit your asset allocation**: Use Swensen's model as a baseline. Prioritize based on your age/money — in your twenties, buy stock funds first for compounding power, add bond funds later.
3. **Check past performance**: Look at 10-15 year returns, but remember past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Use fund screeners on Vanguard, Schwab, etc. — filter by "international index funds with expense ratio less than 0.75%"

### Sample All-Vanguard Portfolio

**Stocks ("Equities"):**
| Allocation | Fund | Ticker |
|---|---|---|
| 30% | Total Market Index | VTSMX |
| 20% | Total International Stock Index | VGTSX |
| 20% | REIT Index | VGSIX |

**Bonds:**
| Allocation | Fund | Ticker |
|---|---|---|
| 5% | Short-Term Treasury Index Fund | VSBSX |
| 5% | Intermediate-Term Treasury Index Fund | VSIGX |
| 5% | Vanguard Short-Term Treasury Index Fund | VSBSX |
| 15% | Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund | VTAPX |

- These are just a few of thousands of index funds — be flexible with the allocation to match your risk tolerance
- **You don't need all seven funds on day one** — even one is better than nothing. Build up over time.

### Buying into Individual Index Funds
- Usually 3-7 funds. If you can buy all at once, do it. Most people can't (minimums $1,000-$3,000 each).
- **Strategy**: Set a savings goal for the first fund's minimum. Buy it, set up automatic monthly contributions to that fund. Then save for the next fund's minimum with the remaining monthly investment budget. Repeat.
- Example: $500/month to invest → save 2 months for $1,000 minimum on Fund 1 → buy Fund 1, set up $100/month auto-invest → use remaining $400/month to save for Fund 2 minimum → repeat
- **Split money across funds according to your asset allocation**, not evenly. If allocating 30% domestic equities and investing $1,000/month total: $1,000 × 0.3 = $300 to domestic equity fund.
- **Rebalance about once a year** — covered in the next chapter

### Dollar-Cost Averaging: Investing Slowly Over Time
- Investing regular amounts over time, rather than all at once
- If you invest $10,000 and the stock drops 20% to $8,000, it needs a 25% gain (not 20%) to get back to $10,000
- By investing at regular intervals, you **hedge against drops** — if the fund drops, you pick up shares at a discount price
- This is the essence of **automatic investing**: consistently invest so you don't have to guess market timing
- **Lump sum vs. DCA**: Vanguard research found that lump-sum investing actually **beats DCA two-thirds of the time** because the market tends to go up and stocks/bonds tend to outperform cash
- **However**: Investing isn't just about math — it's about the effect of emotions on your behavior
- **Bottom line**: Most of us already dollar-cost average via monthly paycheck contributions. If you have a lump sum, most of the time you'll get better returns investing it all at once.

### What About Other Kinds of Investments?

#### Real Estate
- For most Americans, their home is their biggest "investment" — but it's **not a very good one** for individual investors
- Returns are generally poor when you factor in maintenance, property taxes, etc.
- Most people confuse their house with an investment they buy/sell for profit — but they just roll equity into the next, more expensive house
- Keep your portfolio balanced — if $2,000/month goes to mortgage, make sure you still diversify into other areas
- More on real estate in Chapter 9

#### Art
- Art advisers claim ~10% annual returns, but Stanford research (2013) found returns are **closer to 6.5%** with significantly underestimated risk
- The overestimation is due to **selection bias** (repeat sales of popular pieces not counted)
- **John Maynard Keynes** example: spent $840,000 (2018 dollars) on 135 pieces → collection now worth $99 million (10.9%/year return). But **just two pieces account for half the value**. Could you predict which two?

#### High-Risk, High-Potential-for-Reward Investments
- If you have a solid, diversified portfolio and want some fun: set aside ~**10% of portfolio for "high risk" investing** — but treat it as fun money, not money you need
- Ramit's fun money: particular stocks he likes (e.g., Amazon), sector funds (health care index fund), angel investing in ultra-early-stage startups
- All funded by money he can afford to lose

### My Counterintuitive $297,754 Lesson
- At 15, Ramit's dad told him to open a Roth IRA. Opened a custodial account at E-Trade.
- His "research" at the time: looking up high-risk/high-reward tech stocks, reading Industry Standard magazine during the dot-com boom
- Bought **three stocks**:
  1. **JDS Uniphase (JDSU)** — optical communications. Stock effectively went to zero.
  2. **Excite** — early search engine, renamed Excite@Home. Went bankrupt.
  3. **Amazon.com** — invested roughly $11,000. Investment turned into **$297,754**.
- **Superficial lesson**: "You're so smart for picking Amazon!"
- **Real lesson**: It was pure luck — a freakish once-in-a-generation winner. He could have picked 100 other stocks and statistically would not have beaten the market. He's actually made much more money on long-term, low-cost investing.
- **Superficial lesson 2**: "Getting the right stock matters a lot."
- **Real lesson 2**: **Getting started early mattered a lot.** He was extremely lucky to have a dad who pushed him to start investing early.

### "What About Crypto?"
- Ramit's view: Most crypto "investors" have no other investments — they're **speculators, not investors**
- Devastating question to ask crypto evangelists: *"Besides crypto, what does the rest of your portfolio look like?"* — They almost never have a diversified portfolio.
- Three typical answers: "I don't invest in fiat currency," "Traditional investments are boring," "You don't understand blockchain"

**Ramit's Guide to Understanding Crypto as an Investment:**

| They Say | Reality |
|---|---|
| Crypto is a currency you can use to pay for goods | Very few merchants accept it. Currency should be stable — crypto swings 25%+ in a week. |
| Crypto allows anonymous transactions via decentralization | True, but currently it's largely used for illicit purchases |
| It's better than fiat currency | Fanatics always bring up Nixon 1971, gold standard. "Money isn't real." |
| It's not about Bitcoin, it's about blockchain | Blockchain technology is impressive, but fans use it to distract from actual usage failures. 80% of ICOs were "identified as scams." |
| Crypto is an amazing investment | Bitcoin increased 240% Jan–June 2017 vs. 9% S&P 500. But irregular returns are a larger problem — soared 340% in 3 months then dropped like a rock. Same gambling behavior: addicted to highs, hide losses. |

- Signs of gambling and cult-like behavior in crypto: questioning is punished, increasingly risky behavior (borrowing to invest), unfalsifiable claims, moving goalposts
- **Ramit's advice**: If you want to invest in crypto, fine — but first build a complete, diversified portfolio (Ladder of Investing, 6 months emergency fund). Then invest 5-10% in something fun. Limit your exposure by periodically rebalancing.

### Week 6 Action Steps

**1. Figure out your investing style (30 minutes)**
- Target date fund (recommended, 85% Solution) OR index funds (more control, more complexity)

**2. Research your investments (3 hours to 1 week)**
- Target date fund: research from Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Schwab
- Own portfolio: use Swensen model as template, prioritize which funds to buy first vs. later, use fund screeners

**3. Buy your fund(s) (1 hour to 1 week)**
- Target date fund: transfer money to investment account, enter ticker, click buy
- For 401(k)s, money should already be flowing from paycheck. For Roth IRAs, money should be in savings account from Chapter 5 automation
- If you don't have cash to invest yet, set a savings goal and wait until you have enough for the fund minimum
- Individual index funds: buy one at a time, set up savings accounts for the others

## Chapter 8: How to Maintain and Grow Your System
*"You've done the hard work. What's next? Here's how to maintain (and grow) your financial infrastructure to achieve your Rich Life."*

- One of the shortest chapters — because you've already done the hard work with the 85 Percent Solution
- You've built a financial system that's essentially on autopilot
- This chapter is extra credit for the seriously nerdy

### Get Honest About Why You Want More
- Before optimizing further, ask: What's the point? Is it to earn an extra $10,000 or to actually live a Rich Life?
- **Warning against "living in the spreadsheet"**: People take control of finances (good), change their lives to save money (good), become increasingly aggressive (not so good), then end up counting money daily and becoming obsessed with winning the game without knowing why they're playing
- **"Taking It From the Clouds to the Street"** exercise: When asked "Why do you want more?" common answers are "freedom" or "security" — too vague. Get specific about your street-level motivation.
- What would your next $1,000 or $10,000 or $25,000 actually buy you? Be brutally honest. It might be as simple as ordering appetizers when eating out, taking a taxi to happy hour, or buying VIP concert tickets.

> *"Two of my favorite things are concerts and coaching high school lacrosse. Thanks to my job and salary I am able to buy VIP tickets to concerts and have scheduling flexibility to hold a full-time job in addition to coaching high school lacrosse."* — Daniel Snow, 38

> *"When I go grocery shopping, I don't look at the prices of things. I get whatever I need and want."* — Elz Jones, 44

### How to Accumulate More and Grow Faster: Feed Your System
- Your automatic system is only as strong as the amount you put in
- Earlier chapters were about the 85 Percent Solution — getting started. Now it's about volume: more in, more out.
- Your purpose matters: FIRE? Save/invest aggressively. Living large in Manhattan? Generous spending plan for cocktail bars. Ideally: both.
- **Every dollar you invest today will be worth many more tomorrow** — like a magical money machine that turns $1 into $5

> *"I automated my savings so that I was saving a substantial amount while paying off credit card debt. This allowed me to pay for a wedding and also buy a house at the bottom of the market in San Diego. My home increased in value from $250,000 to $700,000."* — Alissa McQuestion, 34

### How Rich Will I Be In...

**Monthly Investment Growth at 8% Return:**

| Time Period | $100/month | $500/month | $1,000/month |
|---|---|---|---|
| After 5 years | $7,347 | $36,738 | $73,476 |
| After 10 years | $18,294 | $91,473 | $182,946 |
| After 25 years | $95,102 | $475,513 | $951,026 |

*(Ignores taxes for simplicity)*

- Adding even $100 or $200 more per month changes the numbers dramatically
- Ways to feed more into your system: optimize your Conscious Spending Plan, negotiate purchases, cut expenses ruthlessly, negotiate a higher salary, get a higher-paying job

> *"I went from manually paying my bills every month to automatically paying my bills, automating savings, and planning the whole year's worth of expenses. Now I have even automated monthly donations to charity as well."* — Michael Steele, 40

### Rebalancing Your Investments
- If you chose a **target date fund — you can skip this section** (it rebalances for you automatically)
- When you have a diversified portfolio, some investments will outperform others over time
- **Rebalance once a year** so one category doesn't become a disproportionately large part of your portfolio
- Analogy: If zucchini should be 15% of your backyard but grows to take over 30%, you need to cut it back or grow a bigger yard

**Rebalancing Example (Swensen Model):**
- Start: $10,000 portfolio, 30% domestic equities ($3,000)
- Domestic equities gain 50% → now worth $4,500 → represents 45% of $12,727 portfolio (should be 30%)
- **Solution**: Pause automatic contributions to the overperforming fund. Redistribute that 30% of your contribution evenly over the other five asset classes (each gets an extra 6%)
- After ~8 months, portfolio is back on target, resume original contributions
- **Alternative**: Sell the outperforming equities and redistribute. Ramit doesn't recommend this (trading fees, paperwork, "thinking")
- **If a fund has lost money**: Pause the other funds and add money to the loser until it returns to target allocation
- Set a **calendar reminder** to resume automatic payments after rebalancing
- Use free tools like Personal Capital to visualize your allocation

### Stop Worrying About Taxes
- Taxes are tribal and politically heated. Most people's beliefs about taxes are wrong.

**Six Tax Truths:**

**1. Getting a tax refund is actually great (not bad)**
- Myth: You gave Uncle Sam an interest-free loan
- Reality: You would have spent that money. Data shows small refunds get spent, big refunds get saved or pay off debt.

**2. The US is NOT the highest-taxed nation in the world**
- Myth: America is the highest-taxed nation
- Reality: Not even close

**3. It's NOT better to earn less for tax reasons**
- Myth: Making more money moves you up tax brackets, so you earn less
- Reality: Learn "marginal tax brackets." Only the money *in the higher bracket* is taxed at the higher rate, not your entire income.

**4. People have no idea where their tax money goes**
- Myth: We spend a ton on foreign aid
- Reality: ~1% of federal taxes go to foreign aid

**5. Rich people don't just "use loopholes to never pay taxes"**
- Myth: There are tons of loopholes for the rich
- Reality: A few legit ones (tax-efficient investing, maxing tax-advantaged accounts). Real loopholes are largely available to the super-rich earning millions via capital gains.

**6. Your politics cloud your rational judgment on taxes**
- Your personal psychology and sources of information heavily influence your tax beliefs
- Useful question for people ranting about taxes: "It sounds like you don't like taxes. What do you think your taxes get you?"

**Ramit's take on taxes**: Happy to pay them. Uses every legal tax advantage. Doesn't let taxes be the primary factor in financial decisions. Taxes contribute to an overall system of stability.

### The 85 Percent Solution for Taxes
- Take full advantage of tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Roth IRA)
- 401(k) money won't be taxed until withdrawal. Roth IRA earnings are tax-free.
- By investing in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, you sidestep the vast majority of tax concerns
- Nearly all "tax optimization" claims beyond this are BS

### The Annual Financial Checklist
*Review every year (recommend December). Spend a few hours maintaining your system.*

**Evaluate Your Conscious Spending Plan (3 hours):**
- Fixed costs (50-60%), Investments (10%), Savings (5-10%), Guilt-Free Spending (20-35%)
- Reassess subscriptions, renegotiate cable/internet bills
- Revisit spending goals — are you actively saving for them?
- If not investing at least 10%, find money from guilt-free spending to reallocate

**Negotiate Any Fees (2 hours):**
- Cell phone bill, car insurance, cable/internet, bank fees

**Investments (2 hours):**
- Confirm contributing the max to 401(k) and that money is actually *invested* (not just sitting there)
- Confirm contributing the max to Roth IRA and money is invested in the right funds
- Take advantage of all tax-advantaged accounts

**Debt (2 hours):**
- Revisit debt payoff plan — can you pay off sooner?
- Check credit report and credit score
- Renegotiate credit card APRs

**Credit Cards (1 hour):**
- Make a plan to use your credit card points
- Ask about perks you haven't taken advantage of
- Confirm you're not paying unnecessary fees

**Earn More (ongoing):**
- Negotiate a raise
- Make money on the side

**Other:**
- Review insurance needs (renters, life insurance)
- If you have dependents, create a will

### Why You Should Think Twice About Selling
- Ramit has never sold a single one of his investments — he's investing for the long term
- Anytime you sell, you may owe taxes
- **Short-term capital gains** (held < 1 year): taxed as ordinary income (25-35%)
- **Long-term capital gains** (held > 1 year): taxed at lower rate (~15%). $10,000 gain sold at 9 months = pocket $7,500. Same stock held > 1 year = pocket $8,500.
- **In a tax-advantaged retirement account**: You don't pay taxes in the year you sell. 401(k) = tax deferred until withdrawal. Roth IRA = you already paid taxes, so withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Bottom line**: Invest in retirement accounts and hold your investments for the long term

### Knowing When to Sell Your Investments
**Only three reasons to sell when you're young:**

**1. You Need the Money for an Emergency**
Emergency money hierarchy:
1. Use your savings account (Chapter 2)
2. Earn additional money (drive for Uber, sell old clothes, tutor)
3. Ask family to borrow money
4. Use retirement account money (Roth IRA principal is penalty-free; 401(k) allows "hardship withdrawals" for medical, home, tuition, foreclosure — but still has penalties)
5. Use credit card — **last resort only**

**2. You Made a Terrible Investment That's Consistently Underperforming**
- If you're in index funds, this is mostly moot — they reflect the entire market
- If the whole industry is declining, it's not just your investment — look at context
- Check: Is the industry still viable? Are competitors replacing it? Cyclical downturn or permanent decline?
- If your stock has plummeted but other companies in the industry are fine, consider selling
- With index funds/target date funds, you rarely need to think about selling

**3. You Achieved Your Specific Goal**
- If you invested for a longer-term goal (5+ years) and achieved it, sell and use the money
- Goals less than 5 years away should use savings accounts, not investments

### Financial Options for Super-Achievers: Make the Ten-Year Plan
*Ask people 5-10 years older than you what they wish they'd started earlier, then do that.*

**1. Emergency Fund**: 6-12 months of spending money (everything: mortgage, loans, food, transportation, taxes, gifts)

**2. Insurance**: Homeowner, life insurance for people with dependents. Insurance is protection from downside risk, not a growth investment.

**3. Children's Education**: Get out of debt and save for your own retirement first. Then consider 529 plans (educational savings with tax advantages).

## Chapter 9: A Rich Life
*"The finances of relationships, weddings, buying a car, your first house, and more"*

- Ramit and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Cass had a pre-Thanksgiving conversation about the big things: kids, marriage, money
- He created an agenda: Number of kids, wedding, when, where to live, names of kids, lifestyle — who works?
- Cass said she wanted to be engaged by Q1 of next year — speaking in financial quarters
- He also raised the topic of signing a prenup
- **Living a Rich Life happens outside the spreadsheet.** At a certain point, you've won the game. Now it takes time, patience, and feeding the system.
- The next layer isn't about recalculating compound interest — it's about **designing the lifestyle you want**

### What Is a Rich Life to You?
- Kids? Two-month vacations? Flying parents out to visit? Retiring in your forties?
- Ramit writing from a safari lodge in Kenya on a six-week honeymoon, invited parents for part of the trip in Italy
- For Ramit: freedom — not thinking about money, being able to travel, work on interesting things, take a taxi without worrying, order whatever at a restaurant
- **Being rich probably means something different to you.** Now it's time to focus on designing YOUR Rich Life.

### Student Loans — Pay Them Down or Invest?
- Average college graduate: ~$35,000 in student loans
- Student loans were probably an excellent financial decision — college graduates far outearn those with only a high school diploma
- Common question: "Should I invest or pay off my student loans?"

> *"I used to have anxiety wondering how I would ever be able to pay off my student loans, have savings, and have a retirement plan. Now my student loans are almost entirely paid off, I have savings accounts (plural), have two retirement accounts, and have no stress around those things."* — Deanna Beaton, 30

---

## BATCH 16 (Pages 371-390)

### Investing vs. Paying Off Student Loans
Three choices:
1. **Pay the minimum on student loans and invest the rest** — best if your loan interest rate is very low (~2%), since you can earn ~8% investing
2. **Pay as much as possible toward student loans first, then invest** — if debt keeps you awake at night, do this. But understand you're losing growth potential for comfort.
3. **Hybrid 50/50 approach** — pay half toward loans (at least the minimum), invest the other half

- **Ramit recommends option 3**: Interest rates on most student loans are similar to stock market returns, so it's roughly a wash. But because of compound interest and tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), Roth IRA), investing in your twenties/early thirties has enormous long-term benefits you can never catch up on later.
- The exact split depends on risk tolerance. Conservative = 50/50. More aggressive = invest more.

### LOVE AND MONEY

- After mastering personal finance basics, the harder part is navigating money with friends, parents, and partners
- Real challenges lie in the "softer discussions": Should you tell friends how much you earn? What's the role of money in getting married? Should you get a prenup?

### Ignore the Noise of Money Advice
- Once you master personal finance, you'll notice how "noisy" the world of money is: uncle's stock tips, random apps, friends scoffing at your strategy
- When you take control of your money, people around you will notice and react oddly — making excuses, putting your efforts down
- Common comments: "Ugh, it's impossible to get ahead..." / "Retire? LOL!" / "Must be nice to have savings like you..."
- **Be mindful of how you discuss money and who you discuss it with.** You're disrupting the normal relationship pattern — people may feel uncomfortable.
- Online noise: "Tax-loss harvesting is the most important thing!" / "You don't have captive insurance?" / "I can't believe you still believe in index investing. It's so obvious Apple is going to the moon."
- **Investing shouldn't be dramatic or fun — it should be methodical, calm, and as fun as watching grass grow.** What you can *do* with your investments and Rich Life — that's fun!
- Log in to your investment account **no more than once a month**

### How to Help Parents Who Are in Debt
- One of the most difficult situations: realizing your aging parents are in financial trouble
- They likely won't come out and admit it — they'll drop clues ("Money is tight right now")
- Use this book as an opener: "Mom, I've been reading this book on personal finance. I learned a lot of things I never knew. How did you learn about money?"
- Your biggest challenge isn't coming up with a technical solution — it's **asking questions, listening carefully, and deciding if they actually want help**
- If they want help, great. If they don't, **respect their decision**, even as things get worse.

**Questions to ask parents (tread gently):**
- Where did they learn about money? What did their parents teach them?
- If they could wave a magic wand, what would their financial situation look like? What would it look like in 5 years?
- How much do they make/spend per month?
- What percentage of income are they saving?
- Do they pay fees for bank accounts/credit cards?
- What's their average monthly credit card balance?
- Do they have investments? How did they choose them?
- Are they maximizing their 401(k), at least to the company match?
- Do they have a Roth IRA?

- Use the **85 Percent Solution**: Help them figure out one or two major actions (setting up automatic savings, paying off one credit card) so they feel a small sense of accomplishment

### Should You Tell Your Parents and Friends How Much Money You Have?
- Ramit's personal story: As his business grew, he felt he should talk to his parents about money. He called his friend Chris (an author from a similar ethnic household) for advice.
- His real questions beneath the surface: Am I doing fine? Did my parents do the right thing by moving to this country? Are they proud of me?
- He was nervous sharing specific success details — worried it might change the relationship, feel "weird"
- **Chris's advice**: You don't need to share exact dollar figures to communicate security. Just tell them business is going well, thank them for teaching you discipline, and **spend time with them** — that's what matters most.
- Parents don't care about the number in your bank account — they want to know you're happy (and married and having kids, if they're Indian parents)

**Lessons on sharing financial information:**
- As you become more financially successful, relationships may change. Be aware of it. Pick restaurants all friends can easily afford.
- Only share specific numbers with your spouse or very close family. Beyond that, ask yourself: Is this to communicate I'm doing well, or to subtly show off? Sharing numbers without context communicates arrogance, not security.

### Talking Money with Your Significant Other
- When getting serious (moving in, getting married, merging finances), spend time talking about money with your partner
- It doesn't have to be painful — it can actually bring you closer together if you know what to ask and stay calm
- **Attitude is more important than specific tactics.** Be nonjudgmental, ask lots of questions.

**Sample questions to ask your partner:**
- "I've been thinking about my personal finances and I'd love to get on the same page with you. Can we talk about it?"
- "How do you think about money?" (Start broad, offer examples, then offer a confession about an area you're not great in — be vulnerable first)
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you be doing with your money?" (Another admission: "I know I should be investing in my 401(k), but I haven't filled out the paperwork yet.")
- "How should we use our money together? Have you thought about whether you'd want to change anything?"

- Goal of the first conversation: Agree that money is important to both of you and that you want to work together. End on a high note!

### The Big Meeting
- Both partners lay bare all finances and work through them together
- Prepare 4-5 hours. Each person brings:
  - A list of all accounts and balances
  - A list of debts and interest rates
  - Monthly expenses
  - Total income
  - Any money owed to you
  - Short-term and long-term financial goals
- Start with the big picture: What lifestyle do you expect? Vacations? Support parents?
- Then look at monthly spending — show yours first, ask "What do you think I could be doing better?"
- Discuss attitudes toward money: Do you spend more than you make? Why? How did your parents talk about money?
- **Most important goal**: Normalize talking about money. Keep it light.
- **Second goal**: Get to a "baseline" — both saving, investing, and paying off debt. Work through this book with your partner. Save the complicated stuff (joining accounts) for later.
- Set up short- and long-term savings goals together. Establish automatic monthly transfers. Come to a shared goal ("We're saving for a $30,000 down payment").
- Check in every 6-12 months to make sure the agreement still works

### When One Person Earns More Than the Other
- Splitting everything 50/50 isn't always fair if one person earns significantly less
- **Suze Orman's approach**: Divide expenses proportionately based on income
- Example: $3,000 rent, you earn $5,000/month, partner earns $4,000/month. Combined = $9,000. You pay 56% ($1,680), partner pays 44% ($1,320).
- Other options: joint household account with proportional contributions, or one person covers rent while other covers groceries
- **Key**: Discuss it, come to an agreement that feels fair (50/50 isn't the only definition of "fair"), and check in every 6-12 months

### What to Do if Your Partner Spends Money Irresponsibly
- Most common complaint from married readers
- **Don't make it personal** ("You can't spend that much on shoes!") — they'll resent it and ignore you
- Instead: **Elevate the conversation beyond you and your partner.** Focus on the plan, not the person.
- Food analogy: Stop discussing dessert and instead agree to fill your plates with vegetables and protein first
- Look at Chapter 4's Conscious Spending Plan together: How much do common purchases (vacations, Christmas, new car) cost? Set savings goals together.
- When arguments about spending happen, redirect to **the plan** (a piece of paper), not each other
- You and your partner will have different approaches — that's fine. Be flexible on *how* you reach goals, as long as you both reach them.

### The $35,000 Question: Why We're All Hypocrites About Our Wedding (and How to Save for Yours)
- Average American wedding costs ~$35,000 (*Wall Street Journal*) — "well over half the median annual income in US households"
- Everyone says "I just want a simple wedding" years before getting married. Then they spend $35,000+. We're all hypocrites about this.
- **It's not about judging expensive weddings** — it's about acknowledging reality and planning for it

**Portland meetup story**: A young woman set up a sub-savings account and was automatically saving for her wedding every month. She got uncomfortable when asked to share on video — because she wasn't even engaged yet. Ramit loved this. **NOT saving for predictable expenses is what's weird.**

#### So What Should You Do?
Three choices:
1. **Cut costs and have a simpler wedding** — great idea, but statistically most people won't do this
2. **Do nothing and figure it out later** — the most common tactic, and a huge mistake that leads to post-wedding debt
3. **Acknowledge reality and plan for the wedding** — ask 10 people which they'd pick and they all say this one. Then ask how much they're saving monthly — "sputtering and silence"

#### How Much Should You Be Saving for Your Future Wedding?

**If you're a woman (avg. marriage age ~27):**

| Age | Months Until Wedding | Monthly Savings Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 22 | 60 | $583 |
| 23 | 48 | $729 |
| 24 | 36 | $972 |
| 25 | 24 | $1,458 |
| 26 | 12 | $2,917 |
| 27 | 1 | $35,000 |

**If you're a man (avg. marriage age ~29):**

| Age | Months Until Wedding | Monthly Savings Needed |
|---|---|---|
| 22 | 84 | $417 |
| 23 | 72 | $486 |
| 24 | 60 | $583 |
| 25 | 48 | $729 |
| 26 | 36 | $972 |
| 27 | 24 | $1,458 |
| 28 | 12 | $2,917 |
| 29 | 1 | $35,000 |

- These are averages — you may marry earlier, later, or not at all. The point is: **when you plan ahead, time is on your side.**

#### Surprising Wedding Math
- Reducing the head count by 50% only reduces the cost by ~25% (because of fixed costs)
- **The best way to cut wedding costs is to tackle fixed costs**, not variable (per-person) costs
- Example: Friend flew in a photographer from the Philippines — even with the flight, saved $4,000
- Sister had invitations designed and printed in India for a fraction of US cost

**Sample Wedding Costs (150 vs. 75 guests):**

*Variable costs:*

| Item | 150 guests | 75 guests |
|---|---|---|
| Open bar/person | $20 | $20 |
| Lunch/person | $30 | $30 |
| Reception/person | $120 | $120 |
| **Subtotal** | **$25,500** | **$12,750** |

*Fixed costs:*

| Item | 150 guests | 75 guests |
|---|---|---|
| DJ | $1,000 | $1,000 |
| Photographer | $4,000 | $4,000 |
| Rentals | $1,500 | $1,250 |
| Flowers | $750 | $600 |
| Hotel for guests | $750 | $750 |
| Invitations | $1,000 | $750 |
| Rehearsal dinner | $1,500 | $1,500 |
| Honeymoon | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| Dress | $800 | $800 |
| Limo | $750 | $750 |
| Rings | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| Bridesmaids' gifts | $4,000 | $4,000 |
| Misc. | $2,000 | $2,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **$28,050** | **$27,400** |
| **Grand Total** | **$53,550** | **$40,150** |

### Should You Sign a Prenup?

---

## BATCH 17 (Pages 391-410)

- A friend hosted a "prenup night" — invited high-net-worth individuals, married people, single people, and a lawyer. One person wrote back declining: "Dude, this is the last thing I'd ever come to." He was married and had signed one — said it was "the worst time of my life."
- Ramit's prenup conversations with Cass were the hardest financial discussions he'd ever had
- Before getting serious, he never thought he'd get a prenup: didn't know anyone who had one, didn't think it applied to him, didn't like "planning to fail"

**Who actually needs a prenup?**
- Most people (99%) don't need one
- You need one if: one partner has disproportionate assets/liabilities relative to the other, one owns a business, or there's an inheritance
- In pop culture, prenups are portrayed as a tool for the wealthier person to screw the other. In reality: a prenup is an agreement on assets accumulated *before* the marriage, assets accumulated *during* the marriage, and what happens if the marriage ends.

**Ramit's decision process:**
- He owns a business → technically should have one
- The decision went to *identity*: "Am I the kind of person who gets a prenup?"
- Called his dad (Indian family, never discussed prenups) and was shocked when his dad said: "No... I don't think so. But I can see why people do it."
- Talked to friends — especially entrepreneurs — and a surprising number said "You're getting a prenup, right?"
- Best information about prenups isn't publicly available (customized, high-stakes legal agreements for wealthy people)
- We plan for everything else (investments, houses, raises) — but when it comes to relationships, planning ahead is called "unromantic." One divorced friend: "I never thought I'd have to use this agreement. But I'm glad I signed it."

**How Ramit brought it up with Cass:**
- During a joint conversation about their future (kids, marriage, money)
- "There's something I want to talk about... It's important to me that we talk about a prenup and sign one before we get married."
- **Key elements of the conversation**:
  1. *Reassured her the marriage was forever*: "I love you and I'm excited to be with you for the rest of my life."
  2. *Explained why*: "Because of my business, I'm coming into this with more money than most people. I don't think we'll ever need it, but it's important to me to protect assets I've accumulated before marriage."
  3. *Emphasized marriage as a team*: "We're a team. I'll look out for you, and I know you'll look out for me."
  4. *Emphasized their lifestyle*: Not sports cars or bottle service — comfortable life shared with family.
  5. *Was firm about wanting to sign one*: "I'm proud of what I've accomplished with my business and finances. It's important to me that I protect those assets in the worst case."
- He started with love, took personal responsibility (not "my lawyers made me"), and spent most of the time on *why* — not the structure or numbers.
- Cass was open to it and wanted to research more.

**The prenup process — lessons learned:**
- He should have shared his finances with Cass *sooner* (she felt uncomfortable not knowing his numbers while he knew hers)
- They discussed travel preferences, business income volatility, risk and security
- Things got tough — they felt resentful and misunderstood. **Cass suggested seeing a counselor** — Ramit agreed immediately
- The counselor helped them navigate the emotional issues around money (hopes, fears, pride, what the marriage means). "Immensely useful."
- Manage your lawyers — each lawyer naturally wants to protect their client from every contingency, which can become adversarial. You need to manage them, not let them lead the process.
- Prenups dictate: what happens to premarital assets, the house, what if you divorce after 1 year vs. 20 years, what if you have kids
- They signed an agreement both were satisfied with
- **"The prenup process taught me more about how we both think about money than anything I'd ever done. We both hope we never have to use it."**

### WORK AND MONEY

- **Two ways to get more money: earn more or spend less.** Ramit personally finds increasing earnings more fun.
- Most income comes from work — it's the best place to optimize
- **Negotiating salary at a new job is the fastest legal way to make money.** Your starting salary sets the bar for future raises and future starting salaries. A $1,000–$2,000 increase compounds over your career.

### Negotiating Your Salary, IWT Style
- Best time to negotiate is when starting a new job (maximum leverage)
- With basic preparation, you can earn $5,000–$10,000 in a simple 10-minute conversation
- Ramit's coaching clients end up negotiating, on average, **$6,000 more** in salary
- **Negotiating is 90% mindset, 10% tactics.** Most people are afraid of being "rude" or having the offer rescinded. That almost never happens — companies may have spent $5,000+ recruiting you.

> *"Because of your book, and subsequent teachings, my salary has gone from $25,000 a year to $80,000 a year. It doesn't matter if it's a yard sale, buying a car, or getting a higher salary, I hit negotiations hard and prepared."* — Jason Flamm, 35

**The 9 Basics of Negotiating:**

**1. Remember that nobody cares about you.** Your manager cares about two things: how you'll make them look better, and how you'll help the company do well. Frame everything around how you benefit the company. Key phrase: "Let's find a way to arrive at a fair number that works for both of us."

**2. Have another job offer — and use it.** The single most effective way to increase your salary. Interview at multiple companies simultaneously. Don't reveal the exact offer or mediocre company names — just mention you have another offer.

**3. Come prepared (99% of people don't).** Research the position's salary range on salary.com and payscale.com. Talk to people at the company. Bring a plan of how you'll hit your goals. Few people bring a strategic plan to a negotiation — this alone could win you $2,000–$5,000.

**4. Have a toolbox of negotiating tricks.** Ask: "What qualities make someone do an extraordinary job in this position?" Then match your accomplishments to their answer. Have stories of past successes, and redirect questions to showcase your strengths.

**5. Negotiate for more than money.** Discuss bonus, stock options, flexible commuting, further education, vacation, job title. Treat each as a lever — if one goes up, you can let another fall. Startups love negotiating stock options over vacation.

**6. Be cooperative, not adversarial.** At this point, they want you and you want them. It's about finding a fair package, not winning a war. Key phrase: "We're pretty close... Now let's see how we can make this work."

**7. Smile.** Seriously. It breaks tension, demonstrates you're a real person, and is one of the most effective negotiation techniques.

**8. Practice negotiating with multiple friends.** Role-play with the toughest friend you have. Videotape it. Not practicing can cost $5,000–$10,000.

**9. If it doesn't work, save face.** Be prepared to either walk away or take the lower salary. If you take it, negotiate a renegotiation in 6 months and **get it in writing**. Key phrase: "I understand you can't offer me what I'm looking for right now. But let's assume I do an excellent job over the next six months. I'd like to talk about renegotiating then. I think that's fair, right? Great. Let's put that in writing."

> *"When I first read the IWT book (around 2012), I was making $10.25 per hour, working full-time at a hotel front desk. After reading your section on negotiation, I negotiated my first raise... Money Made: $520. I've used your advice to negotiate two raises since then... in raises alone, I figure I've made about $8,500 due to buying your book."* — Elizabeth Sullivan-Burton, 30

### Five Things You Should NEVER Do in a Negotiation
1. **Don't tell them your current salary** — they'll just offer slightly more. Say: "I'm sure we can find a number that's fair for both of us." If pressed: "I'm not comfortable revealing my salary, so let's move on." (In New York, asking for your current salary is actually against the law.)
2. **Don't make the first offer** — if they ask you to suggest a number, say: "Now come on, that's your job. What's a fair number that we can both work from?"
3. **If you have an offer from a mediocre company, don't reveal the name** — they'll use it against you. Say something general but true: "It's another tech company that focuses on online consumer applications."
4. **Don't ask "yes" or "no" questions** — instead of "Can you do $55K?" say "Fifty thousand dollars is a great number to work from. We're in the same ballpark. But how can we get to fifty-five thousand?"
5. **Never lie** — don't fabricate offers, inflate your current salary, or promise what you can't deliver

### Case Study: How Rachel Got a 28% Raise by Doing Her Homework
- Rachel, 25, got a marketing manager position at a large San Francisco hotel
- VP of marketing told her she had the *least* experience of anyone interviewed — but hired her anyway
- What she did differently:
  1. **Broke down their job posting line by line** — matched her skills to each requirement
  2. **Researched their website extensively** — spoke knowledgeably about the company and management
  3. **Prepared a spiel about her eclectic résumé** — framed potential weakness as a strength
  4. **Called an expert (Ramit) for outside counsel** — got advice like "Tell them you want to get your hands dirty" and "Suggest three things you'd do to improve their marketing"
  5. **Took Ramit's advice** — created three proposals for trade shows, direct marketing, and brand recognition
- She didn't get a chance to present her proposals during the 4-hour interview, so she emailed them to her potential boss afterward. Also emailed every person she spoke with that day to thank them.
- Result: **28% raise in base salary**, plus stock options
- The VP later said she was impressed by Rachel's energy and intelligence and decided to train someone with potential rather than hire someone more experienced.

> *"Getting rich isn't about one silver bullet or secret strategy. It happens through regular, boring, disciplined action. Most people see only the results... a winnable moment or an article in the press. But it's the behind-the-scenes work that really makes you rich."*

### HOW TO SAVE THOUSANDS ON BIG-TICKET ITEMS
- Big purchases (furniture, cars, houses) are where you can save massive amounts — $2,000 on a car, $40,000 on a house
- People save pennies on daily expenses (not ordering Cokes) but waste thousands on big-ticket items because they don't comparison shop, get conned by salespeople, and think they got a "good deal"

### A Fresh Look at Buying a Car
- **The single most important decision: how long you keep the car.** Drive it 10+ years to realize real savings (once payments end, the savings compound).
- Four steps: Budgeting, Picking a Car, Negotiating, Maintaining

#### Step 1: Budgeting for Your Car
- Decide where a car fits in your spending priorities (Conscious Spending Plan)
- Ignore "$199/month" offers — scammy introductory rates
- Factor in **total cost of ownership**: insurance, gas, maintenance, parking. Ramit's $350/month car payment became ~$1,000/month total in San Francisco.
- With a $200/month budget for the car itself, you can afford roughly a $12,000 car over 5 years

#### Step 2: Don't Buy a Horrible Car
- You're buying it for the next 10+ years — choose wisely
- Any car you evaluate must **fit within your budget** first

**What makes a good car:**
- **Reliability**: Avoid car-repair hassles. Worth paying slightly more for dependability.
- **A car you love**: You'll drive it for a long time. Pick one you enjoy.
- **Resale value**: Check Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com) for 5, 7, 10-year resale. Toyotas and Hondas retain value well.
- **Insurance**: New vs. used car insurance rates differ — even $50/month adds up over years.
- **Fuel efficiency**: Important if you drive a lot.
- **Down payment**: Used cars often require less down. Putting $0 down on a new car means higher interest charges.
- **Interest rate**: Depends on your credit score. Good credit = lower rate. Walk out if the dealer tries to change finance terms at the last minute.

## BATCH 18 (Pages 411-430)

### Dos and Don'ts for Buying a Car

**DO:**
- **Calculate Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Include maintenance, gas, insurance, and resale value — not just the sticker price. Understanding even a rough ballpark of "invisible" costs helps you save more accurately and avoid surprise $600 repair fees.
- **Buy a car that will last you at least ten years**: Not one that looks cool. Looks fade, and you're still stuck with the payments. Optimize for the long term.

**DON'T:**
- **Lease**: Leasing nearly always benefits the dealer, not you. Two exceptions: people who want the newest car and are willing to pay a lot for it, and occasional business owners who lease for tax benefits. *Consumer Reports* found buying a Honda Accord costs $4,597 less over five years than leasing the exact same model. Ramit ran the same calculation on a Toyota Camry — buying saves $6,000 over six years.
- **Sell your car in fewer than seven years**: The real savings come once you've paid off the loan and driven it as long as possible. Most people sell too early. It's much cheaper to maintain your car well and drive it into the ground.
- **Assume you have to buy a used car**: Run the numbers. Over the long term, a new car may save you money if you pick the right one, pay the right price, and drive it for a long time.
- **Stretch your budget for a car**: Set a realistic budget and don't go over it. Other expenses will come up, and you don't want to end up struggling because you can't afford your monthly car payment.

### Conquering Car Salespeople by Outnegotiating Them
- Ramit has seen more than his share of negotiations — including watching his dad negotiate with car dealers for multiple days ("I think we actually ate breakfast at a dealership once")
- **You must negotiate mercilessly with dealers.** People make worse purchasing decisions in a car dealer's office than almost anywhere else.
- If you're not a hardball negotiator, **take someone with you** who is
- **Buy at the end of the year** when dealers are desperate to beat their quotas and far more willing to negotiate — "Their saliva is your salvation!"

**Ramit's car-buying strategy:**
- Recommends Fighting Chance (fightingchance.com) — an information service that tells you exactly how much dealers are paying for your car, including "dealer withholding"
- He spent a month researching and planning, then bought his car for **$2,000 under invoice**
- **The tactic**: At the end of December (quota season), he reached out to **seventeen car dealers**, told them exactly which car he wanted, said he was buying within two weeks, and would go with the lowest price
- Sat back with Earl Grey tea and three tacos with habanero salsa while responses rolled in
- Called the dealers back, told them the lowest price he'd received, gave each a chance to beat it — creating a **bidding war** that led to a "downward spiral of near-orgasmic deals"
- Result: Chose a dealer in Palo Alto who sold him the car $2,000 under invoice. He only went to one dealership — the winning one.

### Boring but Profitable: Maintaining Your Car
- Keeping your car well maintained will make you rich when you eventually sell it
- Take your car's maintenance **as seriously as your retirement savings**
- As soon as you buy your car, enter the major maintenance checkpoints into your calendar (average car: ~15,000 miles per year — use this to calculate a schedule based on manufacturer's instructions)
- Keep regular oil changes, watch tire pressure, keep your car clean
- **Keep a record of every service** — when you sell, show the documentation to prove how meticulous you've been (and charge accordingly)
- People who don't keep maintenance records get negotiated down by savvy buyers like Ramit

### The Biggest Big-Ticket Item of All: Buying a House

- If you could make $100,000 in one year by spending 10 hours per week — everyone would do it. So why don't people spend that time researching the biggest purchase of their lives?
- By doing the research that 99% of people don't, you can save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan
- **Houses are primarily for living in, not for making huge cash gains**
- If you buy a house without opening a spreadsheet and entering numbers, you are a fool. You can save $75,000 or $125,000 over a thirty-year loan just by educating yourself.
- Preparation time: at least three months, probably twelve, to prepare to buy

### Who Should Buy a House?

- We're taught the American dream is to own a house — but many young people want a house as their first major purchase without even having a 401(k) or spending plan
- When asked why they want to buy, they say "They're a good investment" — which isn't really true

**Traditional guidelines for buying (the old rules):**
- House costs no more than 2.5x your annual income
- At least 20% down payment
- Total monthly payments (mortgage, maintenance, insurance, taxes) ≤ 30% of gross income
- Example: $50,000 income → $125,000 house, $25,000 down, $1,250/month total

**Key questions before buying:**
1. **Can you afford at least a 20% down payment?** If not, set a savings goal and don't even think about buying until you reach it. Without 20% down, you'll pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).
2. **Can you really afford the monthly payments?** Don't compare your $1,000/month rent to a $1,000/month mortgage — you'll likely want a nicer house (higher payment), plus property taxes, insurance, maintenance fees add hundreds per month. Real cost is 40-50% higher than the mortgage alone (~$1,500/month when you factor everything in).
3. **Are the houses in your price range?** Your first house probably won't have as many bedrooms as you want or be in the most amazing location. Start with a **starter house** — they're called that for a reason.
4. **Will you stay at least ten years?** The longer you stay, the more you save. Real estate agent fees (~6% of selling price), moving costs, and potential taxes hit much harder if you only stay a few years. **Buy only if you're planning to stay ten years or more.**

- Buying a house is NOT a natural step everyone has to take — it changes your lifestyle forever (monthly payments, job flexibility, risk tolerance)
- **Benefits of buying**: If you can afford it and you're staying in the same area for a long time, it can be a great way to build equity and create a stable place to raise a family

### The Truth: Real Estate Is a Poor Investment for Most Individual Investors
- Americans' biggest "investments" are their houses, but real estate is also where Americans lose the most money
- Real estate is the **most overrated investment in America** — it's a purchase first, an investment second
- **Problem of risk**: If your house is your biggest investment, how diversified is your portfolio? If you pay $2,000/month on a mortgage, are you investing $6,000 elsewhere? Of course not.
- **Poor returns**: Yale economist Robert Shiller found that from 1915 through 2015, home prices increased on average only **0.6% per year**
- **The illusion of profit**: Someone buys for $250,000, sells for $400,000 twenty years later, thinks they made $150,000. But they forgot property taxes, maintenance, and the **opportunity cost** of not having that money in the stock market. Investing in the stock market has trumped real estate quite handily.
- Ramit rents by choice! But he also has a sub-savings account called "Down Payment for Future House" — he just thinks of it as a purchase, not an investment
- **Buy a house and keep it as long as possible. Do your homework and negotiate. Know your alternatives (like renting).**

### Buying vs. Renting: The Surprising Numbers
- Renting is actually a smart decision for many people, especially in expensive areas like New York or San Francisco
- **"Renters are throwing away money"** is a cliche — beware. It's just not true.
- The total price of buying and owning a house is far greater than the sticker price

**The Cost of Buying a Home Over 30 Years:**

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Purchase price (typical single-family home) | $220,000 |
| Down payment (10%) | $22,000 |
| Closing costs | $11,000 |
| Private mortgage insurance (76 payments of 0.5% PMI at $82.50) | $6,270 |
| Interest @ 4.5% | $163,165 |
| Taxes & insurance ($3,400/year) | $102,000 |
| Maintenance ($2,200/year) | $66,000 |
| Major repairs & improvements | $200,000 |
| **Total costs** | **$778,409** |

- Your $220,000 house actually costs you over **$400,000** more than the sticker price — and that doesn't include moving costs, new furniture, renovations, or real estate fees when you sell
- When you rent, you're not paying all those extra fees — which frees up cash to invest
- The key is **investing that extra money** rather than spending it. If you just waste it, you might as well buy a house as a forced savings account.
- **Best tool**: Use the *New York Times*' "Is It Better to Rent or Buy?" calculator — it factors in maintenance, renovations, capital gains, costs of buying and selling, inflation, and more

### Becoming a Homeowner: Tips for Buying Your New House
- Be conservative with real estate even if aggressive with asset allocation
- Stick to: 20% down, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, total monthly payment ≤ 30% of gross income

**6 Tips:**

**1. Check your credit score.** Higher score = better interest rate = lower total cost AND lower monthly payments.

**Effect of Credit Scores on a Mortgage Payment ($220,000 loan, 30-year fixed):**

| FICO Score | APR | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| 760–850 | 4.18% | $1,073 | $166,378 |
| 700–759 | 4.402% | $1,102 | $176,696 |

**2. Save as much as possible for a down payment.** Traditionally 20%. Below 20%, you'll pay PMI (0.5–1% of mortgage annually). If you can't save at least 10%, stop thinking about buying.

**3. Calculate the total amount of buying a new house.** Small surprises ($100/month unexpected cost) add up to $36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan — plus opportunity cost. Closing costs are 2–5% of the house price ($10,000 on a $200,000 house). Ideally total price shouldn't be more than 3x your gross annual income. Ask homeowners about "surprise costs of owning a house."

**4. Get the most conservative, boring loan possible.** 30-year fixed-rate loan. Yes, you pay more interest than a 15-year — but it's more flexible (you can pay extra toward principal if you want). *Consumer Reports*: comparing extra $100/month toward mortgage vs. investing in an index fund at 8%, over 20 years the index fund won 100% of the time. "The longer you own your home, the less likely it is that mortgage prepayment will be the better choice."

**5. Don't forget to check for perks.** Many state and local governments offer benefits for first-time home buyers (check hud.gov). Also check associations you belong to — credit unions, alumni associations, teachers' associations. Even Costco offers special mortgage rates for members.

**6. Use online services to comparison shop.** Use Zillow, Redfin, and Trulia for home prices, tax records, and neighborhood reviews. For homeowner's insurance, use Insure.com. Ask your auto insurance company for a discounted rate if you bundle homeowner's insurance.

### Myths About Owning a Home

**"Prices in real estate always go up" (or "the value of a house doubles every ten years")**
- Not true. Net house prices haven't increased when you factor in inflation, taxes, and other homeowner fees. The sticker price is higher, but you have to dig beneath the surface.

**"You can use leverage to increase your money"**
- Homeowners point to leverage as the key benefit: put $20,000 down on a $100,000 house, house climbs to $120,000 = effectively doubled your money. But leverage works against you too — if your house declines 10%, you don't just lose 10% of equity. It's more like 20% once you factor in the 6% Realtor's fees, closing costs, new furniture, and other expenses.

**"I can deduct my mortgage interest from my taxes and save a bunch of money"**
- Be very careful. People forget they're "saving" money they ordinarily would never have spent. Owning a house costs much more than renting when you include maintenance, renovations, and higher insurance. Furthermore, 2018 laws reduced the benefit of these tax deductions.

### How to Tackle Future Large Purchases
- Weddings, cars, houses — but there are plenty of other major expenses people don't plan for (having kids, etc.)
- Not planning ahead always costs you much more in the end

**Three steps:**

**1. Acknowledge that you're probably not being realistic about how much things will cost — then force yourself to be.** Bite the bullet, sit down, make a realistic plan on a napkin. Just spend twenty minutes.

**2. Set up an automatic savings plan.** Assume $35,000 wedding + $20,000 car + $20,000 first two years of kid + down payment for a house in your city. Figure out how much you need to save per month. If you're 25 and getting married in 3 years: $45,000/36 months = $1,250/month. May be more than $1,000/month. Better to know now than later.

**3. You can't have the best of everything, so use the P word.** Priorities are essential. Do you want filet mignon or an open bar at your wedding? A backyard or a neighborhood with better schools? If you have the costs on paper, you'll know exactly which trade-offs to make. Without anything written down, there will appear to be no trade-offs necessary — and that's how people get into staggering amounts of debt.

- For the things that aren't important, beg, borrow, and steal to save money. For the things that are important, spend on it — but choose the cheapest options elsewhere. Whatever you do, **negotiate the hell out of big-ticket purchases.**

### Giving Back: Elevating Your Goals Beyond the Day to Day
- Most people spend their entire lives handling day-to-day money issues and never get ahead
- If you've followed the steps in this book, you've moved past these basic questions — your accounts work together automatically
- Now it's time to **elevate your goals beyond the day to day**
- Part of getting rich is **giving back to the community** that helped you flourish
- Traditional ways: volunteering at a soup kitchen, becoming a Big Brother or Big Sister
- You don't need to be rich to give back — even $100 helps. Sites like Pencils of Promise or Kiva.org let you give directly to developing communities.
- The *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* community raised over $300,000 for Pencils of Promise, resulting in building thirteen schools for impoverished children around the world
- Or donate to your high school, local library, environmental action groups — whatever means the most to you
- If you're short on cash, **donate your time**, which is often more valuable than money

> *"If you think about it, philanthropy mirrors the very same I Will Teach You to Be Rich principles you read in this book: The simplest step can get you started. Pick an organization to support or a place to volunteer. You don't have to be rich to be a philanthropist, just as you don't have to be rich to invest."*

### A Rich Life for You — and Others

- If the book has been successful, the end of the book is the beginning of a rich future for the reader
- Being rich isn't just about money — most people around us have strong opinions about money yet are clueless with their own
- Conscious spending can be fun (especially when automated)
- **Not enough people know about being rich.** It's not mythical — not just for Ivy League grads and lottery winners. Anyone can be rich. It's just a question of what rich means to you.
- Money is a small but important part of a Rich Life. Life is meant to be lived outside the spreadsheet.
- **A Rich Life is about more than money. It starts by managing your own. And it continues by helping others become rich.**

> *"Would you do me a favor and pass the word along to your friends to help them focus on their goals, too? A Rich Life is about more than money. It starts by managing your own. And it continues by helping others become rich."*
