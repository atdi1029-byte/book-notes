<!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
<h2 id="takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="summary-section">
<ol>
<li><strong>National wealth is measured by annual production, not gold reserves.</strong> The central error of mercantilism &mdash; equating money with wealth &mdash; leads to ruinous policy. Real wealth is the total annual produce of a nation's land and labour.</li>
<li><strong>The division of labour is the primary engine of productivity.</strong> Smith's pin factory: 1 worker = 1 pin/day; 10 specialized workers = 48,000 pins/day. Specialization multiplies output through increased dexterity, time savings, and machine invention.</li>
<li><strong>Self-interest, channelled through markets, serves the public good.</strong> "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." The invisible hand.</li>
<li><strong>Prices gravitate toward a "natural price" of wages + rent + profit.</strong> Market prices fluctuate, but competition constantly pushes toward equilibrium &mdash; a gravitational model.</li>
<li><strong>Wages are highest in growing economies, not the richest ones.</strong> North America paid higher wages than wealthier England because demand for labour was increasing fastest.</li>
<li><strong>High wages are a feature, not a bug.</strong> "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable." Well-fed workers are more productive.</li>
<li><strong>Profits and wages are inversely related.</strong> As capital accumulates and competition increases, profits fall and wages rise &mdash; the normal trajectory of improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Monopoly is the great enemy of prosperity.</strong> Whether corporate charters, guild restrictions, or colonial trade monopolies &mdash; every exclusive privilege raises prices and misallocates capital.</li>
<li><strong>Free trade benefits both parties.</strong> The maxim of every prudent family &mdash; never make at home what costs more to buy &mdash; applies equally to nations.</li>
<li><strong>The mercantile system sacrifices the consumer to the producer.</strong> "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production." The entire mercantile system inverts this logic.</li>
<li><strong>Europe reversed the natural order of development.</strong> Commerce lured feudal lords into dismissing retainers, inadvertently establishing order, good government, and secure property rights.</li>
<li><strong>Parsimony (saving) is the engine of capital accumulation.</strong> "The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition" overcomes the worst government policy.</li>
<li><strong>Paper money and banking are powerful but dangerous.</strong> Substituting paper for gold frees up metal for productive use, but over-issuance leads to collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Government has exactly three duties:</strong> defence, justice, and public works/institutions unprofitable for private enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Public education is essential.</strong> The division of labour makes workers "as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become." Parish schools should teach geometry and mechanics universally.</li>
<li><strong>Endowed institutions become corrupt.</strong> At Oxford, professors have "given up altogether even the pretence of teaching." Where salaries are guaranteed, indolence prevails.</li>
<li><strong>Taxation should follow four maxims:</strong> equality, certainty, convenience, and economy. An uncertain tax is worse than an unequal one.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes on necessaries cascade through the economy</strong>, raising wages and costs for everyone. The middling ranks should oppose them in self-interest.</li>
<li><strong>National debt is never honestly repaid.</strong> Every resolution involves some form of bankruptcy &mdash; usually disguised as coin debasement or inflation.</li>
<li><strong>The British Empire is an expensive delusion.</strong> "Not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine" &mdash; immense expense, no profit.</li>
<li><strong>Commerce should be a bond of friendship among nations.</strong> Mercantile jealousy makes neighbours into enemies when their prosperity should be welcomed &mdash; rich neighbours are better customers.</li>
<li><strong>The interests of merchants diverge from the public interest.</strong> Their proposals "ought always to be listened to with great precaution... an order of men who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public."</li>
<li><strong>Standing armies are necessary and compatible with liberty.</strong> After firearms, discipline matters more than individual skill. Under a constitutional sovereign, a standing army can even be favourable to liberty.</li>
<li><strong>Religious diversity produces moderation.</strong> Hundreds of small sects competing for adherents "would in time, probably reduce doctrine to that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of absurdity."</li>
<li><strong>Property creates the need for government.</strong> "It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of valuable property can sleep a single night in security." Government is "instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor."</li>

<!-- THEMATIC BREAKDOWNS -->
<h2 id="themes">Thematic Breakdowns</h2>

<h3>The Nature of Wealth and Value</h3>
<p>Smith demolishes the mercantilist equation of wealth with gold. Wealth is the annual produce of land and labour &mdash; the goods and services a nation creates, not the metal it hoards. Labour is "the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things." The diamond-water paradox (water is essential but cheap; diamonds are useless but expensive) reveals the distinction between value in use and value in exchange.</p>

<h3>The Mechanics of Markets</h3>
<p>Prices are composed of three elements: wages, rent, and profit. The "natural price" is the equilibrium around which market prices gravitate. When market price exceeds natural price, profits attract new entrants, increasing supply and driving price down. Smith's price theory is essentially a gravitational model &mdash; constant fluctuation around a stable centre, maintained by the force of competition.</p>

<h3>Labour and Class</h3>
<p>Smith is remarkably sympathetic to workers. Masters hold structural advantages (fewer in number, legally permitted to combine, able to hold out longer), while workers' combinations are illegal. The law, "when it has attempted to regulate wages, has always been rather to lower them than to raise them." Smith identifies three orders of society: landlords (aligned with the public but too indolent), labourers (aligned with the public but uneducated), and merchants/manufacturers (divergent from the public and actively deceptive).</p>

<h3>Capital and Growth</h3>
<p>Capital accumulation precedes and enables the division of labour. Saving is the engine of growth &mdash; what is saved from revenue is added to capital, employing additional productive hands. The "uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition" is more powerful than any government policy, capable of overcoming "the greatest errors of administration."</p>

<h3>Trade and Empire</h3>
<p>Smith's critique of mercantilism is devastating: export bounties impose double taxes on the people; import restrictions misallocate capital; colonial monopolies enrich a few merchants while impoverishing the nation. The British Empire's colonial monopoly cost more in wars than it ever returned in profit. Smith's radical proposal &mdash; voluntarily give up the colonies or grant them parliamentary representation &mdash; was ignored, and the American Revolution vindicated his analysis.</p>

<h3>Government and Public Finance</h3>
<p>The sovereign's three duties are defence, justice, and public works. Smith's four maxims of taxation (equality, certainty, convenience, economy) remain foundational. He analyzes every major tax instrument with forensic precision, always tracing who ultimately bears the burden. Taxes on luxuries are relatively harmless; taxes on necessaries cascade through the economy, raising costs for everyone.</p>

<!-- CONTRARIAN IDEAS -->
<h2 id="contrarian">Contrarian Ideas</h2>
<div class="contrarian">
<ol>
<li><strong>Talent differences are mostly environmental, not innate.</strong> "The difference between a philosopher and a common street porter seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education."</li>
<li><strong>Slavery is the most expensive form of labour.</strong> "The work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any."</li>
<li><strong>Great proprietors are terrible improvers.</strong> The man born to wealth attends to ornament, not profit. Small proprietors with everything at stake improve best.</li>
<li><strong>Commerce destroyed feudalism by appealing to vanity.</strong> Lords traded "the maintenance of 1000 men for a pair of diamond buckles" &mdash; bartering power for trinkets.</li>
<li><strong>Wine countries are sober; beer countries are drunk.</strong> Cheapness of wine in southern Europe discourages excess; dearness of alcohol in the north turns drinking into a vice.</li>
<li><strong>The division of labour makes workers stupid.</strong> Smith, the champion of specialization, acknowledges its human cost: the worker confined to repetitive tasks becomes "as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become."</li>
<li><strong>Fear of food hoarding is compared to belief in witchcraft.</strong> Popular panic about merchants profiteering is as irrational as witch-hunting; free trade is the best preventive of famine.</li>
<li><strong>National debt is never honestly repaid.</strong> The Romans reduced their debt by 96% through successive currency devaluations. Every government eventually defaults &mdash; usually in disguise.</li>
<li><strong>Joint-stock companies are inherently wasteful.</strong> Directors "manage other people's money, not their own." Only four businesses suit the joint-stock form: banking, insurance, canals, and water supply.</li>
<li><strong>"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public."</strong> Even social gatherings of businessmen tend toward cartels.</li>
<li><strong>The discovery of America brought "dreadful misfortunes" to natives.</strong> Smith is clear-eyed: "folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over the first project of establishing those colonies."</li>
<li><strong>Science is "the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition."</strong> Smith advocates state-supported scientific education to combat religious fanaticism.</li>

<li><strong>Gradually restore free trade</strong> &mdash; "only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection"</li>
<li><strong>Separate judicial from executive power</strong> and make judges independent</li>
<li><strong>Allow hundreds of small religious sects</strong> rather than establishing one church &mdash; competition produces moderation</li>
<li><strong>Fund public works through user fees</strong> (tolls, port-duties) rather than general taxation</li>

<blockquote>"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Every individual... neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it... he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would... assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should ever be established in it."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expense, without being likely to bring any profit."</blockquote>

<!-- DETAILED CHAPTER NOTES -->

<!-- BOOK I -->
<h2 id="book1" class="chapter-header">Book I: Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour</h2>

<h3>Ch. 1: Of the Division of Labour</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The pin factory:</strong> A single worker could barely make 1 pin/day. Ten workers dividing 18 operations produce 48,000 pins/day (4,800 per person)</li>
<li>Three mechanisms: (1) increased dexterity at narrow tasks, (2) time savings from not switching tools/locations, (3) machine invention by focused workers</li>
<li>Agriculture cannot be subdivided as completely &mdash; seasonal work prevents full specialization</li>
<li>A European peasant's standard of living exceeds an African king's, thanks to the division of labour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 2: The Propensity to Exchange</h3>
<blockquote>"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Division of labour arises from a natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange &mdash; not from human wisdom</li>
<li>"Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another"</li>
<li>Talent differences between people are largely the <em>effect</em>, not the cause, of division of labour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 3: Extent of the Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small markets cannot support specialization &mdash; a rural highlander must be "butcher, baker, and brewer for his own family"</li>
<li><strong>Water transport</strong> vastly extends markets: 6&ndash;8 men on a ship carry as much as 50 wagons with 400 horses</li>
<li>Civilization first develops along coasts and navigable rivers: Egypt, Bengal, China, the Mediterranean</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 4: Origin of Money</h3>
<ul>
<li>Barter requires a "double coincidence of wants" &mdash; money emerges as the universally accepted commodity</li>
<li>Metals preferred: durable, divisible, non-perishable. Coined to certify weight and fineness</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign debasement:</strong> princes reduced metal content to pay debts cheaply</li>
<li><strong>The diamond-water paradox:</strong> things with greatest use often have least exchange value, and vice versa</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 5&ndash;6: Real vs. Nominal Price; Components of Price</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labour is the real measure of value</strong> &mdash; "the original purchase money that was paid for all things"</li>
<li>Gold and silver vary in value; corn is a better long-term measure</li>
<li>Three components of price: <strong>wages</strong> (labour), <strong>profit</strong> (stock), and <strong>rent</strong> (land)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 7: Natural and Market Price</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural price:</strong> sufficient to pay rent, wages, and profit at ordinary rates</li>
<li><strong>Market price:</strong> fluctuates with supply relative to effectual demand</li>
<li>Natural price is the "central price" to which all prices continually gravitate &mdash; a proto-equilibrium concept</li>
<li>Monopolies keep supply below demand, maintaining prices above natural levels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 8: Wages of Labour</h3>
<blockquote>"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Masters have the advantage in wage bargaining: fewer, legally permitted to combine, can hold out longer</li>
<li>"We rarely hear of the combinations of masters" &mdash; but they are ALWAYS in tacit combination</li>
<li>Wages highest not in the richest countries but the <strong>fastest-growing</strong> ones (North America > England)</li>
<li>High wages make workers MORE productive &mdash; well-fed workers work harder and live longer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 9: Profits of Stock</h3>
<ul>
<li>Profits rise and fall <strong>opposite</strong> to wages &mdash; increasing capital means more competition among employers</li>
<li>Historical trend: English interest rates fell from 10% (Henry VIII) to 3% (Smith's time)</li>
<li>High profits raise prices more than high wages &mdash; profits compound geometrically through the production chain</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 10: Wages and Profit in Different Employments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Five equalizing differences:</strong> agreeableness, learning cost, employment constancy, trust required, probability of success</li>
<li>"The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities" &mdash; people systematically overestimate their chances (proto-behavioural economics)</li>
<li><strong>Corporations and apprenticeships</strong> restrain competition: 7-year apprenticeships breed idleness, not industry</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Settlement laws</strong> obstruct labour mobility: "it is often more difficult for a poor man to pass the artificial boundary of a parish, than an arm of the sea"</li>
<li>"When the legislature attempts to regulate between masters and workmen, its counsellors are always the masters"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 11: Rent of Land (longest chapter)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rent is monopoly price:</strong> "naturally the highest the tenant can afford" &mdash; not proportioned to landlord's improvements</li>
<li>Rent is the <em>effect</em> of price, not its cause (unlike wages and profit)</li>
<li>Food always affords rent; other produce sometimes does, sometimes doesn't</li>
<li>Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers are "the greatest of all improvements" &mdash; they break town monopolies</li>
<li><strong>Massive digression on silver prices</strong> (1350&ndash;1776): empirical investigation tracking corn/silver ratios across four centuries</li>
<li>Three effects of progress: (1) food prices rise, (2) manufactured goods prices fall, (3) rude produce (meat, timber) rises</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution... It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public."</blockquote>

<!-- BOOK II -->
<h2 id="book2" class="chapter-header">Book II: Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock</h2>

<h3>Ch. 1: Division of Stock</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stock divides into: <strong>capital</strong> (from which revenue is derived) and <strong>stock for immediate consumption</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fixed capital:</strong> machines, buildings, improved land, acquired skills</li>
<li><strong>Circulating capital:</strong> money, provisions, raw materials, finished goods not yet sold</li>
<li>No fixed capital yields revenue without circulating capital to maintain it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 2: Money as a Branch of Stock</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The revenue of the society consists altogether in those goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them"</li>
<li><strong>Paper money</strong> replaces gold/silver like replacing "a highway through productive land with a waggon-way through the air"</li>
<li><strong>Scottish banking:</strong> cash accounts enabled Edinburgh merchants to operate with less idle cash than London</li>
<li>Dangers of over-trading: "drawing and redrawing" fictitious bills cost 8&ndash;14%+ per year; reckless banks collapsed in ~2 years</li>
<li>Banks should lend only what merchants would otherwise keep idle &mdash; not fund fixed capital or speculation</li>
<li>Smith recommends <strong>no bank notes under &pound;5</strong> &mdash; confine paper to dealer circulation, leave gold for consumers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 3: Productive and Unproductive Labour</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Productive labour</strong> fixes itself in vendible commodity; <strong>unproductive labour</strong> perishes in the instant of production (servants, actors, soldiers)</li>
<li>"Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of capital"</li>
<li>"Every prodigal appears to be a public enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor"</li>
<li>"Great nations are never impoverished by private, sometimes are by public prodigality and misconduct"</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition... like the unknown principle of animal life, frequently restores health and vigour in spite not only of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor."</blockquote>

<h3>Ch. 4&ndash;5: Stock Lent at Interest; Employment of Capitals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interest fell because <strong>capital accumulated</strong>, not because silver became abundant (refuting Locke and Montesquieu)</li>
<li>Legal interest should be slightly above the lowest market rate &mdash; too high drives money to prodigals</li>
<li><strong>Four ways to employ capital:</strong> agriculture, manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture is most productive:</strong> "Nature labours along with man" at no cost &mdash; no equal capital in manufactures occasions so great a reproduction</li>
<li>Home trade turns over fastest; carrying trade is "the natural effect and symptom of great national wealth, not the cause"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- BOOK III -->
<h2 id="book3" class="chapter-header">Book III: Of the Different Progress of Opulence in Different Nations</h2>

<h3>Ch. 1: Natural Progress of Opulence</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural order:</strong> agriculture first, then manufactures, then foreign commerce</li>
<li>Land is visible, secure, under the owner's control; "a planter who cultivates his own land is really a master, independent of all the world"</li>
<li>But in modern Europe, this natural order was <strong>entirely inverted</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 2: Discouragement of Agriculture After Rome's Fall</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primogeniture</strong> and <strong>entails</strong> prevented division of great estates &mdash; "founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions"</li>
<li>"A great proprietor is seldom a great improver" &mdash; attends to ornament, not profit</li>
<li>"The work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any"</li>
<li>Evolution: slaves &rarr; metayers (sharecroppers) &rarr; tenant farmers with fixed rent</li>
<li><strong>English yeomanry:</strong> freeholds giving parliamentary votes "contributed more to the present grandeur of England than all their boasted regulations of commerce"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 3&ndash;4: Rise of Towns; Commerce Improves the Country</h3>
<blockquote>"All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Towns won freedoms through king-burgher alliance against feudal lords</li>
<li>"Order and good government, and along with them the liberty and security of individuals, were established in cities" while countryside remained lawless</li>
<li>Commerce improved the country in three ways: (1) market for rude produce, (2) merchants purchased and improved land, (3) <strong>commerce introduced order and good government</strong> &mdash; the most important but least observed</li>
<li>The "diamond buckle" revolution: lords traded 1000 retainers for personal luxuries, inadvertently dissolving feudal power</li>
<li>"For the gratification of the most childish, the meanest, and the most sordid of all vanities, they gradually bartered their whole power and authority"</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- BOOK IV -->
<h2 id="book4" class="chapter-header">Book IV: Of Systems of Political Economy</h2>

<h3>Ch. 1&ndash;2: The Mercantile System; Restraints on Imports</h3>
<ul>
<li>Popular fallacy: wealth = money. This confusion drives disastrous policy &mdash; hoarding gold while starving industry</li>
<li>"A country that has wherewithal to buy wine will always get the wine it has occasion for"</li>
<li><strong>The invisible hand:</strong> every individual "neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it"</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would assume an authority which could safely be trusted to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scotland could grow grapes in greenhouses at 30x the import cost &mdash; a "manifest absurdity"</li>
<li>Two justified restraints: <strong>national defence</strong> (the Act of Navigation) and <strong>equalizing domestic taxes</strong></li>
<li>"To expect that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain is as absurd as to expect an Oceana or Utopia"</li>
<li>Manufacturers have become "like an overgrown standing army... formidable to the government"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 3: Balance of Trade Doctrine</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nothing can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade"</li>
<li>Trade without force or constraint "is always advantageous to both" parties</li>
<li>Commerce should be "a bond of union and friendship" among nations, not a source of war</li>
<li>Rich neighbours are better customers: France with 24 million inhabitants would be 8x the market of 3 million American colonists</li>
<li><strong>Bank of Amsterdam:</strong> detailed analysis of how bank money, receipts, and the agio system stabilized Dutch commerce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 4&ndash;6: Drawbacks, Bounties, Treaties</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The corn bounty:</strong> imposes two taxes on the people &mdash; the bounty payment itself AND higher domestic corn prices</li>
<li>The herring-buss bounty: vessels "fitted out for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty"</li>
<li>Free corn trade is the best preventive of famine; fear of engrossing compared to <strong>witchcraft</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Methuen Treaty</strong> (Portugal): celebrated as a masterpiece but actually disadvantageous to Britain</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"To prohibit a great people from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind."</blockquote>

<h3>Ch. 7: Of Colonies</h3>
<ul>
<li>European colonies founded from "the sacred thirst of gold" &mdash; not necessity</li>
<li>"Mining is the most ruinous of all projects" &mdash; like the philosopher's stone</li>
<li>English colonies prospered most: no engrossing of land, no primogeniture, lower taxes, more extensive markets</li>
<li>Monopoly's five harms: draws capital from other trades, keeps profits artificially high, favours distant over nearby markets, forces round-about trade, makes the whole system fragile</li>
<li>"Under the present system of management, Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion she assumes over her colonies"</li>
<li>Smith's radical proposal: give up the colonies or grant them parliamentary representation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind."</blockquote>

<h3>Ch. 8&ndash;9: Mercantile System Concluded; The Physiocrats</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wool export laws: exporting wool was made felony &mdash; "Like the laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all written in blood"</li>
<li>"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production" &mdash; the mercantile system inverts this</li>
<li>Physiocratic system: "nearest approximation to truth yet published" despite calling manufacturers "barren"</li>
<li><strong>The three duties of the sovereign:</strong> defence, justice, and public works that private enterprise cannot profitably provide</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<!-- BOOK V -->
<h2 id="book5" class="chapter-header">Book V: Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth</h2>

<h3>Ch. 1, Part I: Expense of Defence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Four stages of military organization: hunters &rarr; shepherds &rarr; husbandmen &rarr; commercial nations</li>
<li><strong>Militia vs. standing army:</strong> after firearms, regularity and discipline matter more than individual skill</li>
<li>Three great historical revolutions decided by standing armies: Philip of Macedon, Rome vs. Carthage, fall of Western Rome</li>
<li>Standing armies <strong>can be favourable to liberty</strong> &mdash; the sovereign's security makes repressive surveillance unnecessary</li>
<li>"The invention of firearms is certainly favourable both to the permanency and to the extension of civilization"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 1, Part II: Expense of Justice</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality" &mdash; property creates the need for government</li>
<li>Government "instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor"</li>
<li>Making justice a revenue source produced gross abuses &mdash; larger presents got better justice</li>
<li>Competition between English courts (King's Bench, Exchequer, Chancery) "formed by emulation" the admirable English legal system</li>
<li>"The judicial should be separated from the executive power"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 1, Part III: Public Works and Education</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roads, bridges, canals should be self-funding through <strong>tolls</strong> &mdash; "scarce possible to invent a more equitable way"</li>
<li><strong>Joint-stock companies:</strong> directors manage other people's money &mdash; "like the stewards of a rich man, they easily give themselves a dispensation from attention to small matters"</li>
<li>Only four businesses suit joint-stock: <strong>banking, insurance, canals, water supply</strong></li>
<li>East India Company: "no other sovereigns ever were so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Education</h4>
<ul>
<li>At <strong>Oxford</strong>, professors "have given up altogether even the pretence of teaching"</li>
<li>The best-taught subjects are those with <strong>no public institutions</strong> &mdash; fencing, dancing, reading, writing, arithmetic</li>
<li>"The richest and best endowed universities have been slowest in adopting improvements"</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour comes to be confined to a few very simple operations... He naturally loses the habit of exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The state should <strong>facilitate, encourage, and even impose</strong> basic education on all people</li>
<li>Teach <strong>geometry and mechanics</strong> instead of Latin</li>
<li>"Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Religious Institutions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clergy paid by voluntary contributions are zealous; clergy on fixed salaries become indolent</li>
<li>Hundreds of small sects would produce moderation &mdash; "that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of absurdity"</li>
<li>Commerce destroyed Church power the same way it destroyed feudal power: luxury goods let clergy spend on themselves rather than retainers</li>
<li>Two systems of morality: the liberal (people of fashion) and the austere (common people)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 2: Sources of Public Revenue</h3>
<ul>
<li>"No two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and sovereign" &mdash; states are terrible merchants</li>
<li>Crown lands should be sold: private owners would improve them; parks and gardens are the only lands that ought to belong to the crown</li>
<li><strong>Four maxims of taxation:</strong></li>
<li style="list-style:none"><ol>
  <li><strong>Equality:</strong> contribution in proportion to ability</li>
  <li><strong>Certainty:</strong> "a very considerable degree of inequality is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty"</li>
  <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> levied at the most convenient time and manner</li>
  <li><strong>Economy:</strong> take out as little as possible beyond what reaches the treasury</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Ground-rents are "a still more proper subject of taxation" &mdash; they owe their existence entirely to good government</li>
<li>"It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion"</li>
<li><strong>Taxes on necessaries</strong> operate as indirect taxes on wages, cascading through the whole economy</li>
<li>Stock is mobile and secret; land is immovable and visible &mdash; capital taxes risk driving stock abroad</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 3: Of Public Debts</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment" &mdash; governments borrow rather than tax for war</li>
<li>People remote from war "scarce feel any inconveniency" and enjoy reading about battles in newspapers</li>
<li>"They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory"</li>
<li>Sinking fund is "almost always applied to other purposes" &mdash; the easy expedient of borrowing from it</li>
<li>During 11 years of peace, Britain repaid only &pound;10 million; during 7 years of war, contracted &pound;75 million more</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>"When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bankruptcy by coin debasement:</strong> Romans reduced the As from 12 ounces to &frac12; ounce of copper &mdash; paying debts with 1/24 of original value</li>
<li>"So sudden and so great a bankruptcy... does not appear to have occasioned any" popular clamour</li>
<li>Smith's grand proposal: extend British taxation to Ireland, America, and all provinces with parliamentary representation</li>
</ul>

<h4>Smith's Final Verdict on Empire</h4>
<blockquote>"The rulers of Great Britain have, for more than a century past, amused the people with the imagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expense, without being likely to bring any profit."</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this golden dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as well as the people; or that they should awake from it themselves, and endeavour to awaken the people."</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the project cannot be completed, it ought to be given up</li>
<li>Britain should "free herself from the expense of defending those provinces in time of war" and "accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances"</li>
</ul>
