# The Wealth of Nations - Detailed Notes
## By Adam Smith | 1776 | 5 Books + Conclusion

---

## Introduction and Plan of the Work

- The annual labour of every nation is the fund supplying all necessaries and conveniences it consumes
- National wealth depends on two circumstances: (1) the skill, dexterity, and judgment of its labour, and (2) the proportion of useful labourers to total population
- The first circumstance matters more than the second — civilized nations with many idle people still vastly outproduce "savage" nations where everyone works
- **Book I**: Causes of improvement in productive powers of labour; how produce is distributed among ranks
- **Book II**: Nature, accumulation, and employment of capital stock
- **Book III**: Different progress of opulence in different nations
- **Book IV**: Systems of political economy (mercantile vs. agricultural)
- **Book V**: Revenue of the sovereign/commonwealth — expenses, taxation, public debt

## BOOK I: Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour

### Chapter I: Of the Division of Labour (pp. 10-17)

- **The pin factory**: A single uneducated worker could barely make 1 pin/day. Ten workers dividing 18 operations produce 48,000 pins/day (4,800 per person) — a massive productivity increase
- Division of labour increases output through three mechanisms:
  1. **Increased dexterity** — each worker becomes expert at their narrow task
  2. **Time savings** — no switching between tasks, tools, or locations. A worker who changes tasks "saunters" and loses focus
  3. **Machine invention** — workers focused on single operations naturally discover shortcuts; specialized machine-makers improve further
- Division of labour is carried furthest in "trifling manufactures" (small goods) but the effect is similar in all industries
- Agriculture cannot be subdivided as completely as manufacturing — seasonal work prevents full specialization
- The accommodation of even the poorest labourer in a civilized country requires the cooperation of thousands — his woollen coat alone involves shepherds, sorters, dyers, spinners, weavers, merchants, carriers, ship-builders, sailors, miners, smelters, brickmakers, etc.
- **Key insight**: A European peasant's standard of living exceeds an African king's, thanks to the division of labour

### Chapter II: Of the Principle Which Gives Occasion to the Division of Labour (pp. 18-20)

- Division of labour arises NOT from human wisdom or planning, but from a natural **propensity to truck, barter, and exchange**
- This may be a consequence of the faculties of reason and speech
- Animals do not exchange — "nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another"
- **"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest"** — the most famous line in the book
- We address others' self-love, not their humanity; we talk of their advantages, not our necessities
- Self-interest drives specialization: a person good at making bows focuses on that, exchanges for meat, and becomes an armourer
- The certainty of exchanging surplus encourages everyone to specialize
- **Talent differences** between people are largely the effect, not the cause, of division of labour — a philosopher and a street porter differ mainly due to habit, custom, and education, not nature
- Unlike animal breeds (mastiff vs. greyhound), human talents can be combined through exchange for mutual benefit

### Chapter III: That the Division of Labour Is Limited by the Extent of the Market (pp. 21-25)

- Small markets cannot support specialized trades — a rural highlander must be "butcher, baker, and brewer for his own family"
- Specialized trades (like nail-making) can only exist in towns, not scattered villages
- **Water transport** vastly extends markets: 6-8 men on a ship carry as much as 50 wagons with 400 horses
- Water carriage is far cheaper than land carriage — this is why civilization first develops along coasts and navigable rivers
- Egypt (Nile), Bengal (Ganges), China (great rivers and canals) — all early civilizations owed their development to water transport
- Mediterranean Sea was ideal: calm, no tides, many islands, proximity of shores — fostered early navigation
- Inland Africa and northern Asia remained "barbarous" largely due to lack of navigable water access

### Chapter IV: Of the Origin and Use of Money (pp. 25-30)

- Once division of labour is established, each person needs others' products, but barter requires a "double coincidence of wants"
- To solve this, every prudent person keeps a commodity others will accept — this becomes money
- Different societies used different money-commodities: cattle, salt, shells, tobacco, sugar, dried cod, nails
- Metals became preferred: durable, divisible, non-perishable
- First used as unstamped bars (weighed each time), then coined to certify weight and fineness
- Coin denominations originally expressed actual metal content (a pound of silver = a pound sterling)
- **Sovereign debasement**: princes gradually reduced metal content in coins to pay debts cheaply — "ruinous to the creditor, and have sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the fortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned by a very great public calamity"
- Money becomes the universal instrument of commerce
- Smith identifies two meanings of VALUE:
  - **Value in use** (utility) — water is highly useful
  - **Value in exchange** (purchasing power) — diamonds have little use but great exchange value
  - The **diamond-water paradox**: things with greatest use often have least exchange value, and vice versa

### Chapter V: Of the Real and Nominal Price of Commodities (pp. 31-44)

- **Labour is the real measure of exchangeable value** — "Labour was the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things"
- Wealth = command over other people's labour, not gold/silver
- "It was not by gold or silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased"
- But labour is hard to measure directly — people estimate value in money (nominal price) rather than labour (real price)
- Gold and silver vary in value over time (mines discovered, depleted) — so money is an imperfect measure
- **Corn (grain) is a better long-term measure** than silver: century to century, equal quantities of corn command similar quantities of labour
- Year to year, silver is more stable than corn — so silver works better for short-term comparisons
- Extensive historical discussion of coinage: English pound sterling once contained a full pound of silver; by Smith's time, barely a third
- Gold vs. silver as standard: England effectively on gold standard after 1774 gold coin reformation

### Chapter VI: Of the Component Part of the Price of Commodities (pp. 45-50)

- In a primitive society without capital or private land, price = labour cost only
- Once stock (capital) accumulates, a portion of produce must go to the **owner of stock as profit** — he wouldn't employ workers otherwise
- Once land becomes private property, **rent** becomes a third component — landlords demand a share even for natural produce
- **Three components of price**: wages, profit, and rent
- These are also the **three original sources of all revenue**: wages (labour), profits (stock), interest (derived from profit), rent (land)
- All taxes and derived incomes ultimately come from these three sources
- Common language confuses these — farmers call their whole gain "profit" when it includes rent and wages too

### Chapter VII: Of the Natural and Market Price of Commodities (pp. 51-57)

- **Natural price** = price sufficient to pay rent, wages, and profit at their ordinary/average rates
- **Market price** = actual selling price, regulated by supply relative to **effectual demand** (demand from those willing to pay the natural price)
- Market price above natural price → excess profits attract new entrants → supply increases → price falls
- Market price below natural price → losses drive workers/capital away → supply decreases → price rises
- **Natural price is the "central price" to which all prices are continually gravitating** — a proto-equilibrium concept
- Monopolies keep supply below effectual demand, maintaining prices above natural price
- Trade secrets and exclusive privileges of corporations similarly keep prices artificially high
- Apprenticeship statutes and corporation laws restrict competition, keeping wages and profits above natural rates

### Chapter VIII: Of the Wages of Labour (pp. 58-60+)

- In the original state before private property, the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer
- Once land is appropriated and stock accumulated, rent and profit become deductions from the labourer's produce
- **Wages determined by bargaining** between masters and workmen — "the workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little, as possible"
- **Masters have the advantage**: fewer in number, legally permitted to combine (unlike workers' combinations which are illegal), and can hold out longer (living on accumulated stock while workers might starve in weeks)
- "We rarely hear of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen" — but masters are ALWAYS in a tacit combination to keep wages down
- Masters' combinations operate in "utmost silence and secrecy"; workers' combinations are loudly resisted
- There is a minimum wage floor: workers must earn enough to sustain themselves and raise children, or the supply of labour would shrink

---

### Chapter VIII (continued): Of the Wages of Labour (pp. 58-76)

- **Minimum wage floor**: a man must live by his work, and wages must at least maintain him and (usually) enable him to raise a family — otherwise the supply of workers would not sustain itself
- Wages are highest NOT in the richest countries but in the **fastest-growing** ones — North America pays higher wages than England, despite being poorer, because its demand for labour grows faster
- **"It is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition of riches, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor... seems to be the happiest"**
- China: long stationary, wages at bare subsistence. Bengal: declining, wages below subsistence (famine, infanticide)
- High wages of labour are both the EFFECT of increasing wealth and the CAUSE of increasing population
- **"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable"** — a moral argument for high wages
- High wages make workers MORE productive, not less — well-fed workers work harder, live longer, and produce more
- Piece-rate workers tend to overwork and ruin their health within a few years
- Wages don't always correlate with food prices — they are often highest where provisions are cheapest (London wages vs. Scottish wages)
- **Key insight**: Wages are steadier than provision prices because two opposing forces (demand for labour vs. cost of subsistence) counterbalance each other

### Chapter IX: Of the Profits of Stock (pp. 77-85)

- Profits of stock rise and fall with the declining or increasing wealth of society — **opposite** to wages
- Increasing stock (capital) → more competition among employers → lower profits
- Interest rates serve as a proxy for profit rates (since interest is derived from profit)
- Historical trend in England: interest rates fell from 10% (Henry VIII) → 8% → 6% → 5% (Queen Anne) → 3% (government borrowing before the late war)
- **Wages and profits are inversely related**: high wages = low profits and vice versa
- New colonies are exceptions: both wages AND profits are high because land is abundant and stock is scarce relative to opportunity
- In Bengal: wages very low, profits very high (40-60% interest rates) — the oppression of the poor establishes monopoly of the rich
- In a fully stocked country approaching stagnation: profits so low that only the very wealthy could live on interest; everyone else must engage in business (Holland approaching this state)
- **High profits raise prices more than high wages** — wages add arithmetically through the production chain, but profits compound geometrically
- Merchants complain about high wages but say nothing about their own high profits

### Chapter X: Of Wages and Profit in the Different Employments of Labour and Stock (pp. 86-100+)

**Part I — Inequalities arising from the nature of the employments:**

Five circumstances that make up for a small pecuniary gain in some jobs and counterbalance a great one in others:

1. **Agreeableness/disagreeableness** — dirty, dangerous, dishonourable jobs pay more (butchers earn more than most trades; executioners earn more than any; coal-heavers earn 2-3x common labour)
2. **Easiness/difficulty and expense of learning** — skilled trades (mechanics, artificers) pay more than common labour; education is an investment like an expensive machine; lawyers and physicians earn more to recoup years of study
3. **Constancy/inconstancy of employment** — masons and bricklayers earn 50-100% more than regular workers to compensate for seasonal unemployment and weather
4. **Trust reposed in the workmen** — goldsmiths and jewellers earn more because of the precious materials entrusted to them; physicians and lawyers earn more because we trust them with health and reputation
5. **Probability of success** — professions with low success rates (law, medicine, arts) must offer high prizes to attract talent; most lawyers and artists fail, so the successful few must earn enough to compensate

- **"The over-weening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities"** — people systematically overestimate their chances of success (a proto-behavioural economics insight)
- Lotteries never have been and never will be perfectly fair — yet people buy tickets because they overvalue the chance of gain and undervalue the chance of loss
- Young men choose dangerous careers (soldiers, sailors) not rationally but from romantic hopes of glory
- **Insurance** proves people undervalue risk — moderate premiums are usually enough to cover losses AND generate profit, yet people still skip insurance out of overconfidence
- Smuggling: the most hazardous trade of all is the most certain road to bankruptcy
- Apothecaries' seemingly huge markups are mainly wages disguised as profits — they're really being paid for skill and trust, not just drugs

**Part II — Inequalities occasioned by the policy of Europe** (pp. 99+):

- Three conditions for true equality of advantages: (1) employments well known and long established; (2) in their ordinary/natural state; (3) sole or principal employment
- New manufactures pay higher wages to attract workers; wages fall as the trade becomes established
- Demand for labour fluctuates with seasons (harvest, war) causing temporary wage variations
- Manufactures' output depends more on demand/fashion in consuming countries than on provisions prices

---

### Chapter X, Part II: Inequalities Occasioned by the Policy of Europe (pp. 103-123)

- **Three ways European policy creates inequality** in employment advantages:
  1. Restraining competition in some trades to fewer people than would otherwise enter
  2. Increasing competition in others beyond its natural level
  3. Obstructing the free circulation of labour and stock between employments and places

**1. Restraining competition — Corporations and Apprenticeships:**

- **Exclusive privileges of corporations** are the principal tool — incorporated trades require apprenticeship to practice in a town
- Corporation bye-laws limit the number of apprentices per master and mandate 7-year terms
- **"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable"** — preventing a man from working at what he thinks proper is a plain violation of this sacred property
- Long apprenticeships are unnecessary — common trades can be learned in weeks, not years; even fine arts (clocks, watches) don't require 7 years
- Long apprenticeships breed idleness, not industry — journeymen paid by the piece work harder than apprentices; apprentices from charities turn out "idle and worthless"
- Apprenticeships were unknown to the ancients — no Greek or Latin word for the concept
- **Statute of Apprentices (5th of Elizabeth)**: made 7-year apprenticeship mandatory for all trades in market towns — but by interpretation, limited to trades existing before Elizabeth's reign
- Manchester, Birmingham, Wolverhampton grew precisely BECAUSE their new manufactures weren't covered by this old statute
- **"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices"** — another of Smith's most famous lines
- Corporations pretend to be for "better government of the trade" but the real discipline over a workman comes from his customers, not his corporation
- In large incorporated towns, no tolerable workmen can be found in necessary trades — quality work must be done in the suburbs, where workers have no exclusive privilege but only their character to depend on

**Town vs. Country — the core inequality:**

- Town industry is everywhere more advantageous than country industry — great fortunes are made in trade and manufactures, rarely from agriculture
- Corporation regulations transfer wealth from country to town — town traders and artificers gain an advantage over landlords, farmers, and country labourers
- **The price towns pay for country materials = manufactures exported; the dearer the latter, the cheaper the former** — regulations that raise town wages and profits disadvantage the country

**2. Increasing competition — Publicly subsidized education:**

- Pensions, scholarships, and church benefices flood certain professions (clergy, scholars) with more people than would naturally enter
- Church education produces a glut of clergy willing to accept miserable pay — curates earn less than journeymen masons
- Before printing, a scholar and a beggar were "very nearly synonymous" — universities granted scholars licences to beg
- Public education of lawyers and physicians at public expense would similarly crash their incomes
- **"Whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen, it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them"** — law favours masters

**3. Obstructing free circulation — Settlement laws:**

- **Statute of Apprentices** obstructs labour movement between trades in the same place
- **Corporation laws** obstruct stock movement between places
- **Poor Laws (Settlement Laws)** — uniquely English — obstruct the free movement of labour between parishes
- After monasteries dissolved, parishes forced to provide for their own poor (43rd of Elizabeth)
- Complex settlement rules emerged: 40 days undisturbed residence required; then amended to require written notice, rental of £10/year tenement, etc.
- Parish officers bribed their own poor to move clandestinely to other parishes
- Result: a poor man in England can barely move to find work — "it is often more difficult for a poor man to pass the artificial boundary of a parish, than an arm of the sea or a ridge of high mountains"

- Settlement certificates (8th & 9th of William III) were supposed to restore free circulation — a person could bring a certificate from their home parish and settle elsewhere — but certificates were rarely granted and carried their own absurdities
- **"To remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour, from the parish where he chooses to reside, is an evident violation of natural liberty and justice"**
- Unequal wages in neighbouring English parishes (sometimes 20-25% difference) are largely due to settlement law obstructions — in Scotland, where there is no difficulty of settlement, wages vary smoothly
- **When the legislature attempts to regulate differences between masters and workmen, its counsellors are always the masters** — laws in favour of workmen are "just and equitable," those in favour of masters are "sometimes otherwise"
- 8th of George III: masters in London could combine to reduce tailor wages to a legal maximum, but the law would punish workmen severely for a contrary combination — blatant double standard
- Ancient attempts to regulate wages and prices of provisions have entirely fallen into disuse

### Chapter XI: Of the Rent of Land (pp. 124-221)

This is the longest chapter in Book I, divided into three parts plus a long historical digression on silver prices.

**Rent as Monopoly Price:**
- Rent is the price paid for the use of land; it is naturally the highest the tenant can afford given the land's actual circumstances
- **"The rent of land, considered as the price paid for the use of the land, is naturally a monopoly price"** — it is not proportioned to the landlord's improvements but to what the farmer can afford to give
- Landlords demand rent even for unimproved land; improvements made by tenants are commonly claimed by landlords when leases renew
- Kelp (seaweed) example: landlords demand rent for rocks they had nothing to do with improving, paid partly in sea-fish
- **Rent enters into price differently from wages and profit**: high/low wages and profit CAUSE high/low prices; but high/low rent is the EFFECT of price

**Part I — Produce That Always Affords Rent (food):**
- Food always commands more than enough to bring it to market — surplus always remains for the landlord
- Land always produces more food than needed to maintain the labour and replace the stock — something always remains for rent
- Even desert moors in Norway and Scotland produce some pasture for cattle
- **Rent varies with fertility AND situation** — land near a town gives greater rent than equally fertile land far away (transport costs eat into surplus)
- **Good roads, canals, and navigable rivers** are "the greatest of all improvements" — they break down the town's monopoly by extending the market to remote country areas
- Turnpike roads controversy: remote counties petitioned parliament AGAINST road extensions, fearing cheap competition from distant regions

**Bread vs. Meat — the historical progression:**
- In early/rude society: unimproved wilds provide abundant pasture, meat is cheap, bread is dear (corn requires cultivation)
- As cultivation extends: pasture shrinks, meat becomes scarce and dear, bread becomes relatively cheaper
- In Smith's time: a pound of the best butcher's meat worth more than two pounds of the best white bread (reversal from primitive times)
- Buenos Ayres example: an ox cost little more than the labour of catching it; meat was essentially free
- After the Union opened English markets to Highland cattle, Highland rents tripled and quadrupled
- **Rent and profit of corn (food for humans) regulate the rent of all other cultivated land** — no other crop can long afford less, and any that affords more will attract land away from corn

**Specific Crops and Comparative Rents:**
- **Rice** produces far more food per acre than wheat — rice countries support larger populations, and landlords command greater real power
- **Potatoes**: an acre produces 12,000 lbs vs. 2,000 lbs of wheat; three times the nourishment at less expense — if potatoes became Europe's staple food, population would increase enormously and rents would rise far beyond present levels
- **Vineyards**: wine from particular soils commands extraordinary prices due to scarcity and fashion; the greater part of the premium goes to rent, not to the vigneron
- **Sugar colonies**: sugar planters absurdly claim that rum and molasses should defray all costs and sugar be pure profit — "it is as if a corn farmer expected to defray his expense with the chaff and straw"
- **Tobacco**: Virginia and Maryland prefer tobacco to corn; European prohibition of colonial tobacco cultivation gives these colonies a near-monopoly; tobacco planters have sometimes burned surplus crops to keep prices up (like Dutch with spices)
- **Corn as regulator**: in Europe, corn is the principal human food; its rent regulates the rent of all other cultivated land

**PART II — Produce That Sometimes Does, Sometimes Does Not, Afford Rent:**
- Human food is the only produce of land that ALWAYS affords rent
- Other produce (wool, hides, timber, minerals, etc.) sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent, depending on demand and circumstances

**Clothing and Lodging materials:**
- After food, clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind
- In rude states: clothing materials (skins, wool) are superabundant and worthless — thrown away if no foreign commerce exists
- Foreign commerce gives them value: Highland cattle hides, North American peltry, wool exported to Flanders — all afford some rent only because wealthier neighbours create demand
- **Lodging materials** (timber, stone) cannot be transported as easily as clothing materials — a stone quarry near London affords considerable rent; in Scotland/Wales, often none
- In North America, the landlord would be "much obliged to any body who would carry away the greater part of his large trees"
- Timber follows the same price progression as cattle: worthless in rude times, valuable as agriculture clears forests

**Coal mines:**
- Whether a coal mine affords rent depends on fertility AND situation (transport matters enormously for this bulky commodity)
- Fertile mines well-situated may afford very great rent; barren or remote mines afford none
- The most fertile mine in a neighbourhood regulates prices for all others — some mines are abandoned, others worked only by the proprietor
- Coal rent is generally a smaller share of gross produce than land rent — about one-fifth to one-tenth vs. one-third
- In countries where 30 years' purchase is a moderate price for a landed estate, 10 years' purchase is considered good for a coal mine

**Metallic mines:**
- Metallic mine value depends MORE on fertility than situation — precious metals can bear the expense of long-distance transport
- The price of metals at every mine is regulated by the most fertile mine in the WORLD (not just locally)
- **Peru silver mines**: discovery of Potosi degraded European silver mines to worthlessness; most undertakers of new Peruvian mines go bankrupt — "mining is considered there in the same light as here, as a lottery"
- Gold is even harder to smuggle taxes on than silver (found virgin in small pieces, easily concealed) — so gold rent is likely higher than silver rent
- **Precious stones**: demand arises entirely from beauty; value from scarcity; wages and profit consume nearly all the price; rent is minimal
- When Tavernier visited diamond mines of Golconda and Visiapour, the sovereign had ordered all but the largest mines shut — the rest weren't worth the working

**Part III — Variations in the Relative Values of Produce:**
- As improvement advances: food (which always affords rent) rises in value, creating demand for everything else
- The value of a stone quarry rises only with local improvement; the value of a silver mine may not rise at all despite global improvement (if new, more fertile mines are discovered)
- Three possible scenarios for silver prices as civilization advances:
  1. If demand increases faster than supply → silver rises relative to corn (corn becomes cheaper in money terms)
  2. If supply increases faster than demand → silver falls relative to corn (corn becomes dearer in money terms)
  3. If supply and demand increase equally → silver stays stable relative to corn

**Digression Concerning the Variations in the Value of Silver (pp. 151-220):**

Smith undertakes a massive empirical investigation of corn and silver prices across four centuries. Key findings:

**First Period (1350-1570):**
- Average price of wheat gradually fell from ~4 oz silver per quarter to ~2 oz silver — the value of silver was RISING relative to corn
- Causes: European mines exhausted, more expensive to work; growing demand for silver as wealth increased
- Price of wheat c. 1350: not less than 4 oz silver (Tower weight) per quarter ≈ 20 shillings present money
- By the 16th century: moderate price had fallen to ~2 oz silver ≈ 10 shillings
- The Statute of Labourers (25th Edward III, 1350) set wheat at tenpence per bushel as "moderate" — confirming high silver value
- Historians misled by three errors: (1) confusing Scottish "conversion prices" with market prices, (2) sloppy transcription of ancient statutes, (3) assuming that extreme low prices in ancient times represented average prices
- Bishop Fleetwood's collected prices (1202-1597) show the average price of each 12-year period gradually declining from the 13th to mid-16th century — confirming silver's increasing value
- Under the turbulent Plantagenets (12th-15th centuries), one district might suffer famine while a nearby one had plenty, because commerce couldn't connect them

**Second Period (1570-1640):**
- After the discovery of America (particularly the mines of Potosi, 1545), silver flooded into Europe
- The value of silver FELL relative to corn — corn prices roughly doubled or tripled in money terms
- The Spanish tax on silver mines (originally one-fifth, later reduced to one-tenth) consumed most of the rent; the undertakers of new mines frequently went bankrupt — "mining is considered there in the same light as here, as a lottery"
- The money price of labour in Great Britain has risen considerably since the mid-century, but this reflects rising real wages from prosperity, NOT a fall in silver's value
- In France (less prosperous), money wages sank with the average money price of corn — confirming it was silver falling, not labour rising
- The bounty on corn exportation (forced exports) artificially raised domestic corn prices above what silver's decline alone would explain

**Third Period (1640-1776):**
- Silver's value has risen somewhat in the European market during the present century
- Three causes expanded the market for American silver, preventing further decline:
  1. **Europe's market grew**: England, Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Russia all advanced in agriculture and manufactures
  2. **America itself became a new market**: as colonial agriculture and population grew, demand for silver coin increased rapidly — Spanish colonies advancing despite bad government, English colonies advancing even faster
  3. **The East Indies**: direct trade between America and the East Indies (via Acapulco ships) continually augmented, and European East India trade expanded — tea alone imported by the English East India company exceeded £1.5 million/year
- In the East Indies, silver was worth more relative to food than in Europe (rice countries produce 2-3 crops/year, food is more abundant, so silver purchases more labour)
- Silver flows from Europe to India because it commands more labour and commodities there; silver is one of the principal articles of Acapulco trade connecting the two extremities of the old and new worlds
- Annual consumption of gold and silver (in coin, plate, wearing, gilding, etc.) across all countries where those metals are used may be nearly equal to the whole annual produce of mines
- The quantity of brass and iron brought annually from mines is "out of all proportion" greater than gold and silver — yet we don't imagine coarse metals will multiply beyond demand, so why imagine precious metals will?
- **Variations in gold-to-silver ratio**: Before America, 1:10 or 1:12; by mid-18th century, 1:14 or 1:15. Gold rose in proportion to silver, though both metals sank in real value — silver sank proportionally more
- The great quantities of silver sent to the East Indies reduced European silver supply; gold less affected by the India trade
- Gold vs. silver as "cheap" and "dear": in the Spanish market, gold is somewhat nearer to its lowest possible price than silver — the king's tax on gold is only 1/20 vs. 1/10 on silver
- Whether silver has actually risen or fallen during the 18th century is uncertain — "the rise, indeed, supposing there has been any, has hitherto been so very small" that both its reality and direction remain debatable

**Different Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon Three Sorts of Rude Produce:**

**First Sort** — produce whose price RISES with improvement, and whose supply human industry CANNOT multiply at all:
- Rare birds, fish, wild-fowl, game, birds of passage — nature produces them in limited quantities, they are perishable, demand rises with wealth
- Price of venison in Great Britain is not nearly sufficient to compensate the expense of a deer park
- Romans paid extravagant prices for rare birds and fish — Seius paid 6,000 sestertii for a white nightingale, Asinius Celer paid 8,000 sestertii for a surmullet — this reflected the abundance of their labour, not the high value of silver

**Second Sort** — produce which human industry CAN multiply in proportion to demand:
- Cattle, poultry, dairy, hogs — in uncultivated countries these are abundant and nearly worthless; as cultivation advances, their real price rises
- The price of cattle must rise until it becomes profitable to raise food for them on cultivated land — this is "late in the progress of improvement"
- Before the Union, Scottish cattle were so cheap that raising food for them was unprofitable; the Union with England drove up prices and improved the whole country
- In all new colonies, cattle multiplied to run wild and became nearly valueless (Buenos Ayres: cattle killed merely for hide and tallow)
- The dairy, like feeding of hogs and poultry, is originally a save-all — carried on at little or no expense
- Rise in the price of each rude produce "must evidently be previous to the improvement and cultivation of the land which is destined for raising it"
- **"The lands of no country can ever be completely cultivated and improved, till once the price of every produce, which human industry is obliged to raise upon them, has got so high as to pay for the expense of complete improvement and cultivation"**

**Third Sort** — produce whose price NATURALLY tends to rise, but where human industry's efficacy is LIMITED or UNCERTAIN:
- Wool, raw hides, fish, minerals, precious metals
- The market for butcher's meat is confined to the producing country; the market for wool and hides extends to the whole commercial world
- England's wool price FELL considerably since Edward III despite rising meat prices — effect of (1) absolute prohibition on wool exports, (2) permission to import Spanish wool duty-free, (3) prohibition on exporting wool from Ireland to anywhere but England
- These regulations confined English wool to the home market, depressing its price
- Raw hide prices have risen somewhat over time, but government regulations (export prohibition, import duties) have tended to sink them
- Fish prices naturally rise with improvement as supply can't easily scale — larger vessels, greater distances, more expensive machinery needed
- Precious metals: their quantity in any country depends on (1) the country's purchasing power and (2) the fertility of world mines — neither connected to domestic improvement
- **"Whether the one or the other of those two events may happen to take place, is of very little importance to the real wealth and prosperity of the world"** — nominal value of annual produce may change, but real value (what labour it commands) stays the same
- The high value of precious metals is proof only of mine barrenness, NOT of poverty — a poor country can as little afford to pay dearer for gold as for anything else

**Effects of the Progress of Improvement upon the Real Price of Manufactures (pp. 207-210):**

- The natural effect of improvement is to DIMINISH the real price of almost all manufactures
- Better machinery, greater dexterity, more proper division of work → fewer workers needed per unit of output
- Even though the real price of labour rises in a flourishing society, the great diminution of quantity needed more than compensates
- **Coarser manufactures** (metals): greatest price reductions — a better watch movement costs 20 shillings now vs. 20 pounds a century ago; Birmingham and Sheffield ware astonished Continental workmen
- **Fine manufactures** (cloth): less dramatic reduction — price of superfine cloth has risen due to expensive Spanish wool; but coarse Yorkshire cloth has fallen
- In the clothing manufacture, division of labour was nearly the same a century ago, so the reduction comes mainly from three capital improvements: (1) the spinning-wheel replacing the rock and spindle (2x output), (2) machines for winding/arranging yarn, (3) the fulling-mill replacing manual treading of cloth
- In ancient times, coarse manufacture was relatively cheaper than fine manufacture — because coarse was household production (save-all) while fine was specialized foreign manufacture with transport costs and duties

**Conclusion of the Chapter (pp. 211-213):**

- Every improvement in society tends, directly or indirectly, to raise the real rent of land
- Extension of improvement and cultivation raises rent directly; the landlord's share increases with the produce
- Rise in cattle prices raises rent both directly and by increasing the landlord's share
- Improvements in productive powers that reduce manufactures' prices INDIRECTLY raise real rent — the landlord exchanges rude produce for manufactured goods; as manufactures cheapen, the same quantity of rude produce commands more
- **"Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rent of land"**
- The whole annual produce divides into three parts: rent, wages, and profits → three orders of people

**The Three Orders of Society:**
1. **Landlords** — interest "strictly and inseparably connected with the general interest of the society." But their ease and indolence makes them "not only ignorant, but incapable of that application of mind" needed to foresee consequences of policy
2. **Labourers** — interest "as strictly connected with that of the society" as landlords'. Wages rise with prosperity, fall with decline. But "his condition leaves him no time to receive the necessary information, and his education and habits are commonly such as to render him unfit to judge"
3. **Employers of stock (merchants/manufacturers)** — their interest "has NOT the same connexion with the general interest of the society." Rate of profit is naturally LOW in rich countries and HIGH in poor ones — "it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin." Their superior knowledge is of their OWN interest, not the public's. **"The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution... It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public"**

## BOOK II: Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock

### Introduction (pp. 222-223)

- In a rude state with no division of labour, no stock needs to be accumulated beforehand — every man provides for himself
- Once division of labour is established, a man's own labour can supply only a small part of his wants — he needs stock accumulated beforehand
- A weaver cannot work at his peculiar business unless a stock of materials, tools, and provisions has been stored up — either in his own possession or that of some other person
- As division of labour advances, more stock must be accumulated: more workers, more materials, better machines
- The accumulation of stock must be **previous** to the division of labour — stock comes first, then specialization follows
- **Stock increases both the number of workers and their productivity** — better machines enable the same workers to produce far more

### Chapter I: Of the Division of Stock (pp. 224-229)

- When a man's stock barely maintains him for a few days, he rarely thinks of deriving revenue from it — he consumes it as sparingly as possible
- When stock is sufficient to maintain him for months or years, he naturally divides it into two parts:
  1. **Capital** — the part from which he expects to derive revenue
  2. **Stock reserved for immediate consumption** — food, clothes, household furniture not yet consumed

- **Two kinds of capital:**
  1. **Circulating capital** — yields profit by changing hands (being sold/exchanged); includes goods for resale, provisions, materials, money
  2. **Fixed capital** — yields profit by staying in the owner's possession; includes machines, profitable buildings, improved land, acquired skills/talents of workers

- A merchant's capital is almost entirely circulating (no machines needed)
- A manufacturer's capital is partly fixed (machines, tools) and partly circulating (materials, wages)
- **The farmer**: labouring cattle are fixed capital; cattle bought for fattening and resale are circulating capital
- The seed is properly a fixed capital — it goes into the ground and returns from it, never changing masters
- **General stock of society** divides the same way:
  1. Stock reserved for immediate consumption (food, clothes, furniture, houses not generating revenue)
  2. Fixed capital (machines, profitable buildings, improved land, acquired talents of inhabitants)
  3. Circulating capital (money, provisions in dealers' hands, raw materials, finished goods not yet sold)

- **Fixed capital originally derives from and requires circulating capital** to maintain it — machines need materials and workers to build and repair them
- **No fixed capital can yield revenue without a circulating capital** — the most useful machines produce nothing without materials and workers' maintenance
- Land, mines, and fisheries all require both fixed AND circulating capital
- The produce of land replaces not only the farmer's capitals but ALL the capitals in the society — the farmer replaces the manufacturer's provisions, the manufacturer replaces the farmer's finished goods

### Chapter II: Of Money, Considered as a Particular Branch of the General Stock of the Society (pp. 230-269)

- Price of every commodity resolves into wages, profit, and rent — these are the three original sources of all revenue
- **Gross revenue** = whole annual produce of land and labour; **neat (net) revenue** = what remains after deducting the expense of maintaining fixed and circulating capital
- The whole expense of maintaining fixed capital must be excluded from net revenue — neither the materials for machines, nor the labour maintaining them, can be part of what people consume as subsistence/enjoyment
- **Money resembles fixed capital** — though part of circulating capital, it makes no part of society's net revenue; it is the wheel of circulation, not the goods circulated
- **"The revenue of the society consists altogether in those goods, and not in the wheel which circulates them"**
- Revenue consists not in the money received but in what can be purchased with it — the money's worth, not the money itself
- **Paper money as improvement**: substituting paper for gold and silver replaces "a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and sometimes equally convenient"
- Paper money is like replacing a highway through productive land with a "waggon-way through the air" — the land (gold/silver) freed up can become productive capital

**Banking operations in Scotland:**
- Scottish banking companies (Bank of Scotland est. 1695, Royal Bank est. 1727) transformed the economy
- Banks issue promissory notes accepted as currency; if the public trusts the banker, his notes circulate as gold and silver
- A banker keeps only £20,000 in gold/silver to support £100,000 in circulating notes — £80,000 freed up for productive use
- **Cash accounts** — a Scottish innovation: banks grant credit lines (£2-3,000) to anyone with two sureties, allowing piece-meal repayment; this enables Edinburgh merchants to operate with less idle cash than London merchants
- **The channel of circulation**: paper money cannot exceed the value of gold/silver that would otherwise circulate — excess paper returns immediately to banks for redemption
- When banks over-issue, excess notes are exchanged for gold, draining bank coffers — this forces costly replenishment

**Dangers of over-trading and speculative banking:**
- "Bold projectors" borrowed from banks to fund extravagant schemes, expecting 6-10% returns on projects that could never repay
- **Drawing and redrawing**: fictitious bills of exchange between Edinburgh and London traders — A draws on B, B redraws on A, each paying interest and commission; the bills circulate as if backed by real trade but represent no actual goods
- This practice cost 8-14%+ per year in interest and commissions — "raising money by circulation"
- Banks initially couldn't distinguish real from fictitious bills, and were unknowingly funding speculation
- When banks finally tightened credit, distressed projectors blamed "the ignorance, pusillanimity, and bad conduct of the banks"
- A new bank was established expressly to fund these projectors — it "made scarce any distinction between real and circulating bills" and discounted all equally
- This reckless bank's subscriptions totalled £160,000 (only 80% paid); it circulated ~£200,000 in notes but drew £600,000+ in bills on London before collapsing after ~2 years
- **Key lesson**: banks should only lend what a merchant would otherwise keep idle for occasional demands — not fund fixed capital or speculative projects
- **The water-pond analogy**: a bank's coffers are like a pond — if inflows (repayments) equal outflows (advances), the pond stays full; if outflows exceed inflows, the coffers empty and the bank fails

**The Bank of England (pp. 259-262):**
- Incorporated 1694; advanced £1.2 million to government at 8% + £4,000/year management
- Capital grew through successive acts: from £1.2M → £2.2M → £5.6M → £9.4M → £10.8M
- "Its stability is equal to that of the British government" — it acts as engine of state, circulating exchequer bills, paying annuities, advancing taxes
- Dividend varied with interest rates: from 8% → gradually to 5.5%
- It increases industry not by augmenting capital but by converting dead stock (idle gold/silver) into active, productive stock

**Paper money regulation (pp. 262-269):**
- Circulation divides into two branches: dealer-to-dealer (wholesale) and dealer-to-consumer (retail)
- Small bank notes (under £5-10) extend paper money to consumer circulation, driving out nearly all gold/silver from a country
- Where small notes are common, "many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to become bankers" — frequent bankruptcies cause great calamity to poor noteholders
- Smith recommends: **no bank notes under £5** — this confines paper money to dealer circulation while leaving gold/silver for consumers
- **"To restrain private people from receiving in payment the promissory notes of a banker... is a manifest violation of that natural liberty, which it is the proper business of law not to infringe, but to support"** — BUT: "those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals, which might endanger the security of the whole society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the laws of all governments"
- Building party walls to prevent fire is an analogous restriction of natural liberty — justified by public safety
- **North American paper currencies**: colony governments issued government paper (not bank notes) as legal tender, sometimes not redeemable for 15 years; this effectively forced creditors to accept depreciated paper — "a scheme of fraudulent debtors to cheat their creditors"
- Pennsylvania was the most moderate — its paper never fell below gold/silver value
- **Bank of Amsterdam**: keeps bank money slightly scarce relative to demand, creating a 4-5% premium (agio) over current money; foreign bills of exchange must be paid in bank money

### Chapter III: Of the Accumulation of Capital, or of Productive and Unproductive Labour (pp. 270-281)

- **Productive labour** adds value to the subject it works upon — a manufacturer's labour fixes itself in a vendible commodity that lasts after the labour is past
- **Unproductive labour** does not fix itself in any permanent commodity — "like the declamation of the actor, the harangue of the orator, or the tune of the musician, the work of all of them perishes in the very instant of its production"
- Unproductive labourers include: menial servants, sovereign and officers of justice, army, navy, churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters, players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers
- The labour of both is valuable and deserves reward — but the manufacturing labourer's work can afterwards purchase an equal quantity of labour, while the unproductive labourer's cannot
- A man grows rich by employing many productive labourers; grows poor by maintaining many unproductive ones
- **The proportion between productive and unproductive hands** depends on the proportion of annual produce destined for replacing capital vs. constituting revenue (rent and profit)
- In rich countries this proportion is very different from poor countries — more capital goes to replacing productive stock in rich countries
- The rent of land and profits of stock are the principal sources from which unproductive hands derive their subsistence

**Parsimony vs. Prodigality:**
- **"Parsimony, and not industry, is the immediate cause of the increase of capital"** — industry provides what parsimony stores up
- Whatever a person saves from revenue, he adds to capital — either employing additional productive hands himself or lending it to others
- A frugal man is "like the founder of a public work-house" — he establishes a perpetual fund maintaining productive labourers in all times to come
- A prodigal encroaches upon his capital — he feeds idle instead of industrious people, diminishing the fund destined for productive labour
- **"Every prodigal appears to be a public enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor"**
- If every prodigal's expense were in domestic goods (not foreign), the productive funds of society would still suffer — food and clothing diverted to unproductive hands cannot be reproduced with profit
- **"Great nations are never impoverished by private, sometimes are by public prodigality and misconduct"** — courts, armies, fleets are the great consumers of unproductive labour
- **"The uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition"** — this principle is "frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things towards improvement, in spite both of the extravagance of government, and of the greatest errors of administration"
- **"Like the unknown principle of animal life, it frequently restores health and vigour to the constitution, in spite not only of the disease, but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor"**
- England's annual produce is certainly greater now than at the Restoration of Charles II — despite wars, prodigality, and public misconduct — because the frugality and industry of individuals, working silently and steadily, has more than compensated

*[BATCH 2 COMPLETE — Book II through Ch. III (p. 281)]*

### Chapter III (continued): Historical Resilience of England's Capital (pp. 282-285)

- England's annual produce has grown steadily from the Norman Conquest through Elizabeth, through the Restoration, to Smith's time — despite wars, plagues, civil discord
- Since the Restoration alone: the fire and plague of London, two Dutch wars, the revolution, war in Ireland, four French wars (1688, 1701, 1742, 1756), two rebellions (1715, 1745) — national debt contracted exceeds £145 million
- **"It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people"** — let them look after their own expense and trust citizens with theirs
- **Spending on durable commodities vs. hospitality**: a man who spends on buildings, furniture, books, pictures accumulates lasting value; a man who spends on feasts and servants leaves nothing behind
- Durable spending is more favourable to accumulation and public opulence — it maintains productive hands (masons, carpenters, upholsterers) rather than unproductive ones (servants)
- What was formerly a seat of the family of Seymour is now an inn upon the Bath road — the marriage-bed of James I's queen is now "the ornament of an alehouse at Dunfermline"
- However, hospitality shares revenue with friends while durable-goods spending can indicate "a base and selfish disposition"

### Chapter IV: Of Stock Lent at Interest (pp. 286-292)

- Stock lent at interest is always considered a capital by the lender — he expects it returned with a "certain annual rent for the use of it"
- The borrower may use it as capital (productive investment) or as stock for immediate consumption (spending)
- If used as capital: productive labourers reproduce the value with profit, enabling repayment of principal + interest without encroaching on other revenue
- If used for consumption: the borrower "acts the part of a prodigal" — he dissipates what was destined for the industrious, and can neither restore capital nor pay interest without alienating other property
- **Almost all loans are in money, but what the borrower really wants is the goods money can purchase** — the money is merely the deed of assignment
- The same pieces of money may serve as instrument for 3, 10, or 30 different loans — money conveys capitals from lender to borrower
- As the quantity of stock to be lent increases, interest naturally falls — more competition among lenders, fewer profitable opportunities for borrowers
- **Against Locke, Lawe, and Montesquieu**: they imagined the discovery of American silver lowered interest rates by reducing the value of money. Smith refutes this — if silver's value halved, then £100 buys what £50 did before, so £10 interest = what £5 was; the PROPORTION between capital and interest is unchanged
- **Interest fell because capital accumulated**, not because silver became abundant — more stock seeking employment drives down the price of its use
- **Usury laws**: in countries where interest is permitted, the law generally fixes a maximum legal rate to prevent extortion
- The legal rate should be slightly ABOVE the lowest market rate — if fixed at or below market rate, it has the same ruinous effects as total prohibition of interest (drives lending underground, increases risk premium)
- If fixed too high (8-10%), most money would flow to prodigals and projectors, who alone would pay such rates — "sober people" who would use capital profitably refuse to compete
- **"Where the legal rate of interest is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate, sober people are universally preferred, as borrowers"** — this keeps capital in the hands most likely to employ it advantageously
- In Great Britain (market rate ~3%, legal rate 5%): the current setting is "perhaps as proper as any"
- **Land prices vary inversely with interest rates**: when interest was 10%, land sold at 10-12 years' purchase; at 6-5-4%, land sold at 20-25-30 years' purchase. Land prices are higher in France (higher interest) than England (lower interest)

### Chapter V: Of the Different Employments of Capitals (pp. 293-306)

**Four ways a capital may be employed:**
1. **Agriculture** — procuring rude produce (farming, mining, fishing)
2. **Manufacturing** — preparing rude produce for use and consumption
3. **Wholesale trade** — transporting rude or manufactured produce where needed
4. **Retail trade** — dividing produce into small parcels for individual consumers

- Each employment is essential — without agriculture, no raw materials; without manufacturing, no usable goods; without wholesale, no transport; without retail, consumers would have to buy in bulk (a whole ox at a time)
- Retailers enable a poor workman to purchase subsistence "from day to day, or even from hour to hour" — allowing him to employ almost his whole stock as capital
- Retailer competition cannot hurt the public — it tends to make them sell cheaper, not dearer

**Ranking by productive labour put in motion:**

- **Agriculture is the most productive employment of capital**: not only the farmer's labourers but his labouring cattle are productive; and **"Nature labours along with man"** at no cost — planting and tillage animate Nature's fertility
- The rent of land may be considered "the produce of those powers of Nature, the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer" — it is seldom less than a fourth, frequently more than a third, of total produce
- **"No equal quantity of productive labour employed in manufactures, can ever occasion so great a reproduction"** — in manufactures, Nature does nothing, man does all
- After agriculture: manufacturing puts the next greatest quantity of productive labour in motion
- Then wholesale trade, then the carrying trade — each more distant from directly supporting domestic productive labour

**Three sorts of wholesale trade:**
1. **Home trade** — buying in one part of the country, selling in another; replaces TWO domestic capitals per operation
2. **Foreign trade of consumption** — buying foreign goods for home use; replaces only ONE domestic capital (the other is foreign)
3. **Carrying trade** — transporting surplus of foreign countries; replaces NO domestic capital — both capitals belong abroad

- Home trade turns over fastest (3-4x per year); foreign trade of consumption slower (1-2 years); carrying trade slowest
- A capital in the home trade gives 4× to 24× more encouragement to domestic industry than an equal capital in foreign trade of consumption
- **The "invisible hand" principle (implicit)**: "The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture, in manufactures, or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade" — yet private profit naturally directs capital to the most advantageous employment for the whole society
- **American colonies prospered** principally because almost all their capital went to agriculture — "they have no manufactures, those household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture"
- **The carrying trade is the natural effect and symptom of great national wealth, not the cause** — Holland, the richest country per capita, has the greatest carrying share; England second
- Much of what passes for England's "carrying trade" is really round-about foreign trade of consumption — goods from East/West Indies to European markets, purchased with British produce, with returns consumed in Great Britain
- **Agriculture still has the greatest room to absorb capital** — "in all the great countries of Europe, much good land still remains uncultivated" and most cultivated land is far from its potential
- Yet European policy has diverted capital from agriculture to towns and manufactures — Smith promises to explain this in Books III and IV

## BOOK III: Of the Different Progress of Opulence in Different Nations

### Chapter I: Of the Natural Progress of Opulence (pp. 307-310)

- The great commerce of every civilized society is between town and country — the exchange of rude produce for manufactured goods
- The country supplies subsistence and raw materials; the town repays with manufactured goods
- Town can only grow with the increase of surplus produce from the country — town depends on country
- Country inhabitants near a town benefit most: corn sold within a mile fetches the same price as corn from twenty miles away, so nearby farmers save the whole cost of carriage
- **Natural order of capital investment**: (1) agriculture first, (2) then manufactures, (3) then foreign commerce — subsistence must precede conveniency and luxury
- **"Upon equal, or nearly equal profits, most men will choose to employ their capitals, rather in the improvement and cultivation of land, than either in manufactures or in foreign trade"** — land is visible, secure, under the owner's control
- The trader's fortune is always precarious — "frequently to commit it, not only to the winds and the waves, but to the more uncertain elements of human folly and injustice"
- In North American colonies, almost all capital goes to agriculture: an artificer who accumulates surplus becomes a planter, not a manufacturer — "from artificer he becomes planter"
- **"He feels that an artificer is the servant of his customers... but that a planter who cultivates his own land... is really a master, and independent of all the world"**
- Natural progression: agriculture → manufactures → foreign commerce — this has been observed "in some degree in every society"
- **But in modern Europe, this natural order has been entirely inverted** — foreign commerce of cities introduced manufactures, which then improved agriculture (the reverse of the natural order)

### Chapter II: Of the Discouragement of Agriculture in the Ancient State of Europe, After the Fall of the Roman Empire (pp. 311-320)

- After the fall of Rome, Germanic/Scythian invasions caused centuries of rapine and violence — towns deserted, country uncultivated, western Europe sank into barbarism
- Great chieftains engrossed nearly all the land — uncultivated but not without proprietors
- **Law of primogeniture**: to prevent division of estates (which would weaken defence), land descended undivided to one heir — elder male preferred
- **Entails**: introduced to preserve lineal succession, preventing any part of the original estate from being sold or given away — "founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions, that every successive generation of men have not an equal right"
- In Scotland, more than one-third of all lands are under strict entail
- **"A great proprietor is seldom a great improver"** — he attends to ornament rather than profit; improving land requires attention to "small savings and small gains" which a man born to great fortune is seldom capable of
- **Great estates have remained unchanged** for centuries in some cases — compare their condition to small proprietors nearby and "you will require no other argument to convince you how unfavourable such extensive property is to improvement"

**Occupiers of land — evolution from slavery to tenancy:**

- In ancient Europe, land occupiers were slaves (similar to Greek/Roman slavery but milder — villeins, bondmen)
- **"The experience of all ages and nations, I believe, demonstrates that the work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any"** — slaves have no incentive to produce more than their maintenance
- Slavery gradually abolished through the joint operation of proprietor self-interest and sovereign jealousy of great lords
- **Metayers** (French sharecroppers) succeeded slaves — proprietor furnished stock, produce divided equally; tenant had no incentive to improve since landlord took half; tithes (one-tenth) were "a very great hindrance to improvement"
- **Farmers proper** succeeded metayers — cultivated with their own stock, paying a fixed rent
- Tenant security was long precarious — leases short, easily terminated; landlords were "the legislators of every part of Europe" and made laws entirely for their own interest
- **English yeomanry**: freeholds of 40 shillings gave a vote for parliament, making the whole order respectable; English laws "so favourable to the yeomanry, have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of England, than all their boasted regulations of commerce taken together"
- Farmers also burdened with feudal services, purveyance (providing horses/carriages for king's household at arbitrary prices), and the **taille** (French tax on farmer's supposed profits — incentivized hiding stock, not improving)
- **"That order of people, with all the liberty and security which law can give, must always improve under great disadvantage"** — the farmer compared to the proprietor is like a merchant trading with borrowed money vs. one trading with his own

### Chapter III: Of the Rise and Progress of Cities and Towns, After the Fall of the Roman Empire (pp. 321-329)

- After the fall of Rome, town inhabitants were in servile condition — tradesmen and mechanics of servile or near-servile status
- Ancient charters granted as privileges: freedom to give daughters in marriage, bequeath goods, dispose of effects by will — showing what a degraded state these rights were absent
- Town inhabitants — originally "a very poor, mean set of people" — won freedoms earlier than country occupiers
- **Town poll-taxes** were farmed out for fixed rent; burghers got credit to farm their own town's revenue, becoming jointly answerable — leading to **free burghs** (free towns)
- Towns gained: own magistrates, town-council, bye-laws, walls, military discipline — effectively **"independent republics in the heart of their own dominions"**
- **King-burgher alliance against the lords**: mutual hatred of lords united king and town; kings granted charters to weaken baronial power; towns became the king's allies
- In Italy and Switzerland, cities became fully independent republics, conquering the surrounding nobility
- In France and England, cities never became independent but grew powerful enough that "the sovereign could impose no tax upon them... without their own consent" — origin of parliamentary representation of burghs
- **"Order and good government, and along with them the liberty and security of individuals, were established in cities"** while the countryside remained lawless
- Towns near sea-coasts or navigable rivers could trade with the whole world, not dependent on local country alone
- **Italian cities first to reach opulence** — Mediterranean trade, Crusades boosted Venice, Genoa, Pisa
- Manufactures for distant sale arose in two ways: (1) merchants importing foreign luxuries establish local imitations; (2) household manufactures gradually refined for export
- **Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, Birmingham, Wolverhampton** — manufactures that are "the offspring of agriculture," growing naturally from local surplus

### Chapter IV: How the Commerce of Towns Contributed to the Improvement of the Country (pp. 330-340)

- Commerce and manufactures of towns contributed to country improvement in **three ways**:

**1. Market for rude produce** — towns afforded a great and ready market for the countryside's surplus, encouraging cultivation

**2. Merchants purchased and improved land** — wealthy merchants became country gentlemen, and "merchants are commonly ambitious of becoming country gentlemen... and, when they do, they are generally the best of all improvers"
- A merchant is bold; a country gentleman is timid — the merchant applies commercial habits of "order, economy, and attention" to land improvement

**3. Commerce introduced order and good government** — the most important effect, yet the least observed; "Mr Hume is the only writer who, so far as I know, has hitherto taken notice of it"

- **Before commerce**: a great proprietor with £10,000/year could only spend it maintaining hundreds or thousands of retainers and tenants — all personally dependent on him, who "must obey him, for the same reason that soldiers must obey the prince who pays them"
- Great lords became judges, legislators, and military leaders on their own estates — "Mr Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochabor in Scotland... without any legal warrant whatever... used, notwithstanding, to exercise the highest civil and criminal jurisdictions over his own people"
- **"All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind"** — one of Smith's most powerful lines
- **The "diamond buckle" revolution**: once foreign commerce offered luxury goods, the great proprietors could spend their surplus on themselves rather than sharing it with retainers — they traded "the maintenance of 1000 men for a year... for a pair of diamond buckles"
- **"For the gratification of the most childish, the meanest, and the most sordid of all vanities, they gradually bartered their whole power and authority"**
- Retainers dismissed → farms enlarged → tenants became independent → long leases granted → landlords lost feudal authority → **order and good government established**
- This revolution was "brought about by two different orders of people, who had not the least intention to serve the public" — the proprietors' vanity and the merchants' self-interest
- **Europe's inverted order**: commerce and manufactures were the CAUSE of agricultural improvement, not the EFFECT — the opposite of the natural order
- Compare Europe's slow progress (wealth depends on commerce) with North American colonies (wealth founded on agriculture) — population doubles in 20-25 years vs. 500 years in Europe
- **England** uniquely favourable to agriculture: no right of primogeniture in practice for small estates, yeomanry secure and independent, exportation of corn free or encouraged by bounty, importation of live cattle (except from Ireland) prohibited
- France had more foreign commerce earlier, but cultivation was inferior — its laws "never given the same direct encouragement to agriculture"
- **Wealth acquired by commerce is precarious** — "a merchant, it has been said very properly, is not necessarily the citizen of any particular country" — capital can move; only when realized in land improvement is it secure
- Italy the only great European country improved everywhere by foreign commerce; Spain and Portugal introduced no manufactures into their colonies
- **"The ordinary revolutions of war and government easily dry up the sources of that wealth which arises from commerce only"** — but agricultural wealth, once established, endures

## BOOK IV: Of Systems of Political Economy

- Political economy proposes two objects: (1) provide plentiful revenue/subsistence for the people, (2) supply the state with sufficient revenue for public services — **"It proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign"**
- Two systems: the **commercial/mercantile system** and the **agricultural system** (physiocrats)
- Smith begins with the mercantile system as "the modern system, and is best understood in our own country and in our own times"

### Chapter I: Of the Principle of the Commercial or Mercantile System (pp. 342-360)

- **Popular fallacy**: wealth = money (gold and silver); rich country = one abounding in money
- This confusion arises from money's double function as instrument of commerce AND measure of value — "wealth and money, in short, are, in common language, considered as in every respect synonymous"
- Tartars (Genghis Khan) measured wealth in cattle; Spaniards arriving in America first asked if there was gold or silver — same impulse, different tokens
- **Locke's distinction**: money is a "steady friend" unlike consumable goods — but Smith argues this is wrong; the real wealth is in consumable goods, not metal
- European nations tried every means to accumulate gold and silver: Spain/Portugal prohibited export under severest penalties; Scotland had old acts forbidding carrying gold forth "under heavy penalties"
- When countries became commercial, merchants found these prohibitions "extremely inconvenient" — they could buy more advantageously with silver than any other commodity
- **Merchants' arguments** (partly solid, partly sophistical): (1) export prohibitions couldn't actually prevent smuggling due to gold's small bulk; (2) the real way to preserve money was through a **favourable balance of trade** — export more value than you import
- **Mr Mun's analogy**: foreign trade is like seed-time and harvest — sending money abroad (seed) brings back greater returns (harvest)
- This doctrine — **"England's Treasure in Foreign Trade"** (Mun's book title) — became the fundamental maxim of political economy across Europe
- **The two great engines** of mercantilism: restraints upon importation + encouragement to exportation
- **Smith's refutation**: wealth does NOT consist in money or gold/silver, but in consumable goods
- The quantity of coin is regulated by the value of commodities to be circulated — increase value and money will come; try to artificially increase money and you diminish its use
- **"A country that has wherewithal to buy wine, will always get the wine which it has occasion for; and a country that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver, will never be in want of those metals"**
- Gold/silver naturally regulate themselves: when quantity exceeds effectual demand, no law can prevent export; when it falls short, no law is needed to encourage import — "All the sanguinary laws of Spain and Portugal are not able to keep their gold and silver at home"
- **Scarcity of money complaint**: usually a symptom of over-trading, not actual shortage of coin — "Sober men, whose projects have been disproportioned to their capitals, are as likely to have neither wherewithal to buy money, nor credit to borrow it, as prodigals"
- **Paper money** can supply the place of gold/silver during wartime when coin is sent abroad
- **The late French war** cost Britain upwards of £90,000,000 — defrayed not by exporting gold but by exporting British commodities and manufactures
- **Foreign trade's two benefits**: (1) carries out surplus produce for which there is no home demand; (2) brings back something for which there IS demand — "It gives a value to their superfluities, by exchanging them for something else"
- Foreign trade did NOT enrich Europe primarily through gold/silver importation — rather by opening new markets, encouraging new divisions of labour, and improving productive powers
- **Discovery of America** opened "a new and inexhaustible market" — productive powers improved in all European countries
- **East India trade** via Cape of Good Hope opened even more extensive range than America
- East India Companies monopolized trade — "no great nation of Europe has ever yet had the benefit of a free commerce to the East Indies"
- **Gold/silver discovery effect on Europe**: metals became cheaper (prices rose 3x), but this was a trivial convenience/inconvenience — the REAL benefit was market expansion
- **The six principal means** by which the mercantile system proposes to increase gold/silver:
  1. Restraints on importation of goods producible at home
  2. Restraints on importation from countries with "unfavourable" balance of trade
  3. Drawbacks (duty refunds on re-exported goods)
  4. Bounties on exportation
  5. Advantageous treaties of commerce
  6. Establishment of colonies

### Chapter II: Of Restraints upon Importation from Foreign Countries of Such Goods as Can Be Produced at Home (pp. 361-377)

- Restraints (high duties or absolute prohibitions) secure the **monopoly of the home market** to domestic producers
- **"The general industry of the society can never exceed what the capital of the society can employ"** — no regulation can increase total industry beyond what capital supports; it can only divert it into an artificial direction
- **The invisible hand passage**: "every individual... neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it... he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, **led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention**"
- "By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it"
- **"I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it"**
- Every individual judges his own local situation better than any statesman — **"The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would... assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever"**
- **The maxim of every prudent family**: never make at home what costs more to make than to buy — the tailor doesn't make shoes, the shoemaker doesn't make clothes
- **Scotland could grow grapes** using greenhouses at 30x the cost of importing wine — a "manifest absurdity" to encourage such production
- **Natural vs. acquired advantages**: whether one country's advantage is natural (climate) or acquired (skill), it's always more advantageous to buy from them than to make it yourself
- Monopoly of home market may accelerate a particular manufacture, but **"whether it tends either to increase the general industry of the society, or to give it the most advantageous direction, is not, perhaps, altogether so evident"**
- The immediate effect of every regulation is to **diminish revenue** — it directs capital to less natural/profitable channels
- **Two cases** where restraints on imports MAY be justified:
  1. **National defence**: The act of navigation (restricting shipping to British vessels) was "not favourable to foreign commerce" but wisely aimed at national security — **"As defence, however, is of much more importance than opulence, the act of navigation is, perhaps, the wisest of all the commercial regulations of England"**
  2. **Equalizing taxation**: When domestic produce is taxed, an equal tax on competing imports levels the playing field (but never extend beyond the precise foreign commodities competing with taxed domestic goods)
- **Taxes on necessaries of life** (soap, salt, leather, candles) raise the price of ALL commodities — become "a curse equal to the barrenness of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens"
- **Retaliatory tariffs**: "Revenge, in this case, naturally dictates retaliation" — but only wise if there's a probability of procuring repeal of the other country's duties; otherwise it's "a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves"
- **"To expect, indeed, that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in Great Britain, is as absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should ever be established in it"** — the private interests of manufacturers irresistibly oppose free trade
- Manufacturers have become "like an overgrown standing army... formidable to the government, and upon many occasions, intimidate the legislature"
- **The member of parliament** who supports monopoly gets popularity; who opposes it gets "neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank, nor the greatest public services, can protect him from the most infamous abuse and detraction"
- **Gradual reform**: if a long-established monopoly is suddenly removed, workers would be thrown out but could find new employment — "It is surely much easier to change the direction of industry from one sort of labour to another, than to turn idleness and dissipation to any"
- Freedom of trade should be restored "only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection"

### Chapter III: Of the Extraordinary Restraints upon the Importation of Goods from Those Countries with Which the Balance Is Supposed to Be Disadvantageous (pp. 378-400)

#### Part I: The Unreasonableness of Those Restraints, Even upon the Principles of the Commercial System (pp. 378-391)

- Extraordinary restraints on imports from countries with "unfavourable" balance of trade = the **second expedient** of the mercantile system
- French goods subjected to far heavier duties than those of any other country — 25% duty in 1692, then additional 25% in 1696, plus special duties on wine, brandy, salt, vinegar — effectively 75%+ on most French goods
- **Mutual restraints** killed Anglo-French commerce: "Those mutual restraints have put an end to almost all fair commerce between the two nations; and smugglers are now the principal importers"
- **Smith's three refutations** of the balance-of-trade doctrine:
  1. Even if the balance favoured France in free trade, it would NOT follow that trade was disadvantageous to England — if French wines, linens were better and cheaper, England benefits more from buying them
  2. Much of what is imported gets **re-exported** at profit — as with East India goods, Dutch carrying trade in French goods
  3. **"There is no certain criterion"** for determining the balance — custom-house books are inaccurate, and the exchange rate is distorted by coinage differences, seigniorage, bank money vs. common currency

- **Digression on the Bank of Amsterdam** (pp. 383-391):
  - Established 1609 to solve the problem of clipped, worn, debased foreign coins flooding Amsterdam's trade
  - Received all coins at their real intrinsic value, deducting only coinage expense — gave credit in **"bank money"** (always equal to the mint standard)
  - All bills of exchange of 600 guilders+ required payment in bank money — instantly eliminated uncertainty in bills
  - **Bank money vs. common currency**: bank money always worth more (the "agio" — generally 5% premium)
  - Bank money advantages: security (fire, robbery proof), transferability, no counting/transport needed
  - The bank also deals in bullion deposits, granting **"receipts"** (like warehouse receipts) that can be redeemed within 6 months by paying storage fee
  - **Receipts + bank credits** form a sophisticated two-part system: receipt = right to withdraw bullion; bank credit = purchasing power
  - The bank professes to lend nothing, keeping full reserves — "for every guilder circulated as bank money, there is a correspondent guilder in gold or silver"
  - Bank's revenue: warehouse rent on bullion, fees on accounts/transfers, profit from expired receipts and sale of foreign coin — estimated 150,000-200,000 guilders/year
  - Public utility, not revenue, was the bank's original purpose

#### Part II: The Unreasonableness of Those Extraordinary Restraints, upon Other Principles (pp. 391-400)

- **"Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade"** — even on non-mercantilist principles
- Trade forced by bounties and monopolies may be disadvantageous; but **"that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places, is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both"**
- **"By advantage or gain, I understand, not the increase of the quantity of gold and silver, but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country"**
- The country exporting native commodities always derives the greatest revenue from trade
- If England pays France with gold/silver for tobacco and East India goods (round-about trade), the balance appears unfavourable but both countries still gain
- **"It is a losing trade, it is said, which a workman carries on with the alehouse"** — Smith answers: trade with a wine country is NOT necessarily losing; it's like the brewer selling to customers
- **Wine countries are sober; beer countries are drunk**: "The inhabitants of the wine countries are in general the soberest people of Europe; witness the Spaniards, the Italians, and the inhabitants of the southern provinces of France" — cheapness of wine discourages excess; dearness of it in northern countries makes drunkenness a vice
- **"The spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and propagated this doctrine"** — merchants confounded "the common sense of mankind"
- **"In every country it always is, and must be, the interest of the great body of the people, to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest"** — so obvious it's "ridiculous to take any pains to prove it"
- **The interest of merchants vs. the people**: "As it is the interest of the freemen of a corporation to hinder the rest of the inhabitants from employing any workmen but themselves; so it is the interest of the merchants and manufacturers of every country to secure to themselves the monopoly of the home market"
- **Commerce should be a "bond of union and friendship"** among nations, but mercantilism has made it "the most fertile source of discord and animosity"
- **Neighbouring nations' prosperity is advantageous in peace** — rich neighbours afford better markets; "A nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade, is certainly most likely to do so, when its neighbours are all rich, industrious and commercial nations"
- France, with 24 million inhabitants, would be 8x more extensive a market than the 3 million of North American colonies — **"three times more advantageous than the boasted trade with our North American colonies"**
- But mercantile jealousy prevents Franco-British free trade: "Being neighbours, they are necessarily enemies, and the wealth and power of each becomes... more formidable to the other"
- **The balance of produce and consumption** (not trade) is what actually determines prosperity or decay — if annual produce exceeds consumption, capital grows; if consumption exceeds produce, capital decays
- "There is no commercial country in Europe of which the approaching ruin has not frequently been foretold" by balance-of-trade alarmists — yet **none has been impoverished**; all have prospered by opening ports

### Chapter IV: Of Drawbacks (pp. 400-404)

- **Drawbacks** = refunding duties on re-exportation of imported goods — considered the "most reasonable" encouragement to exportation
- Drawbacks preserve the **natural division and distribution of labour** in society — they don't force trade into artificial channels, but prevent duty-imposed distortions from hindering it
- Originally (old subsidy): English merchants could draw back duty within 12 months; aliens within 9 months — wines, currants, and wrought silks excepted
- **Drawbacks on re-exportation** of foreign goods amount to most of the import duty — legitimate since without drawback, goods would never have been imported/re-exported
- **Sugar monopoly example**: West Indian sugar exported within a year gets all import duties refunded; within 3 years, all duties except half the old subsidy
- Some goods (French silks, cambrics, calicoes) prohibited for home consumption but importable for warehousing and re-export — yet no duties drawn back, since manufacturers fear competition from leaked goods
- **French goods treated with special hostility**: "We are unwilling even to be the carriers of French goods, and choose rather to forego a profit to ourselves than to suffer those whom we consider as our enemies to make any profit by our means"
- **Drawbacks on wine**: enormously complex system of duties, subsidies, and partial refunds — designed to favour Portuguese over French wines
- **Drawbacks originally encouraged the carrying trade**, which was thought to bring gold/silver — "though the motive of the institution was, perhaps, abundantly foolish, the institution itself seems reasonable enough"
- Drawbacks justified only for goods **genuinely re-exported** to foreign countries — NOT to colonies where British merchants enjoy monopoly (drawback there is pure revenue loss)
- **Abuse of drawbacks**: particularly tobacco — fraudulently re-imported after claiming drawback, "hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader"

*[BATCH 6 COMPLETE — Book IV Ch. 3-4 finished (pp. 378-404). Next: Ch. 5-7 (pp. 405-521)]*

### Chapter V: Of Bounties (pp. 405-437)

- **Bounties on exportation** are granted to encourage domestic industry by enabling merchants to sell cheaper abroad — but Smith argues they are harmful
- Bounties can only force trade into a **less advantageous channel** than it would naturally follow
- **The corn bounty**: Extensively analyzed as the prime example of bounty folly
  - The bounty raises the money price of corn in the home market, imposing **two taxes on the people**: (1) the tax to pay for the bounty itself, and (2) the higher price of corn at home due to artificially encouraged exportation
  - "So very heavy a tax upon the first necessary of life must either reduce the subsistence of the labouring poor, or it must occasion some augmentation in their pecuniary wages"
- **The real effect of the bounty** is not to raise the real value of corn but to **degrade the real value of silver** — it makes an equal quantity of corn exchange for a smaller quantity of all other goods
- The corn price regulates **everything else**: wages, rents, the price of grass, hay, butcher's meat, horses, land carriage — "the money price of corn regulates that of all other home-made commodities"
- **Bounties upon production** would be more rational than bounties upon exportation — they impose only one tax (to pay the bounty) rather than two, and would actually lower home market prices
- **The herring-buss bounty** (detailed case study): massively wasteful
  - Every barrel of buss-caught herrings cost the government 17s:11¾d. when exported, 14s:3¾d. when for home consumption
  - The tonnage bounty was proportioned to the burden of the ship, not its diligence or success — vessels fitted out "for the sole purpose of catching, not the fish, but the bounty"
  - The buss-fishery bounty **ruined the boat-fishery**, which was better adapted for home supply — "It has ruined the boat fishery, which is by far the best adapted for the supply of the home market"
  - Despite enormous bounties, herring prices had not fallen; they had actually risen
- **Bounties encourage rash undertakers** to adventure in businesses they don't understand — "what they lose by their own negligence and ignorance, more than compensates all that they can gain by the utmost liberality of government"
- **Premiums to artists and manufacturers** (prizes for excellence) are NOT objectionable like export bounties — they encourage dexterity without distorting trade

> **"To prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind."**

#### Digression concerning the Corn Trade and Corn Laws (pp. 420-437)

- The **four branches of the corn trade**: (1) inland dealer, (2) merchant-importer for home consumption, (3) merchant-exporter of home produce, (4) merchant-carrier (import to re-export)
- **Defence of the corn merchant**: The inland dealer's interest and the people's interest are aligned — in scarcity, the dealer's self-interest leads him to ration supply across the season, preventing famine; "without intending the interest of the people, he is necessarily led, by a regard to his own interest, to treat them... pretty much in the same manner as the prudent master of a vessel"
- **Popular fear of engrossing and forestalling** compared to **witchcraft** — both based on superstition and popular prejudice, not reality
  - "The law which would restore entire freedom to the inland trade of corn, would probably prove as effectual to put an end to the popular fears of engrossing and forestalling"
  - Dearths arise from seasons and war, never from combinations of inland dealers
- **Free corn trade is the best preventive of famine**: "unlimited, unrestrained freedom of the corn trade... is the only effectual preventive of the miseries of a famine"
- **Laws concerning corn** compared to **laws concerning religion** — the people feel passionately about both subsistence and salvation, and governments must yield to their prejudices
- The **corn bounty system** has "the same tendency with the practice of Spain and Portugal, to lower somewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it takes place"
- **British prosperity** is NOT thanks to the bounty system but despite it — "That security which the laws in Great Britain give to every man, that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labour, is alone sufficient to make any country flourish"
- **The 13th of the present king, c. 43** (new corn law): improved the system by lowering import duties, reducing the bounty, and allowing free re-export from warehouses

### Chapter VI: Of Treaties of Commerce (pp. 437-441)

- When a nation grants trade advantages to another by treaty, the favoured nation's merchants gain a **sort of monopoly** — advantageous to them but disadvantageous to the favouring country
- **The Methuen Treaty (1703)** between England and Portugal: celebrated as a masterpiece of commercial policy, but Smith finds it disadvantageous to Britain
  - Portugal admits British woolens; Britain admits Portuguese wines at 2/3 the duty on French wines
  - Portugal receives annual gold from Brazil exceeding its domestic needs — the surplus must be exported, and Britain buys it
  - But **gold is easily procured** from any nation — Britain does not need the Portugal trade for this
  - A **direct foreign trade of consumption** is always more advantageous than a round-about one — if Britain traded directly for consumable goods instead of first buying Portuguese gold, it would employ less capital and create more industry
  - **"Almost all our gold, it is said, comes from Portugal"** — but the effectual demand for gold is limited; whatever surplus comes from Portugal must be re-exported elsewhere anyway
- **The silly notion** that England could not subsist without the Portugal trade led France and Spain to force Portugal to exclude British ships — yet the inconvenience of losing the trade would have been merely temporary embarrassment

### Chapter VII: Of Colonies (pp. 447-521)

#### Part I: Of the Motives for Establishing New Colonies (pp. 447-455)

- **Greek colonies**: Founded from necessity — overcrowded city-states sent out surplus population; the colony was considered an **emancipated child**, settling its own laws and government with no subordination to the mother city
- **Roman colonies**: Founded for **political-military purposes** — garrisons in conquered provinces; the colony was a **corporation** subject to the mother city's authority, not an independent state; the Latin word *colonia* = plantation, vs. Greek *apoixia* = separation/departure
- **European colonies in America**: Founded from **no necessity**, but driven by the **hope of gold and silver**
  - The Venetians' spice trade monopoly → Portuguese exploration around Africa → Columbus's westward project → discovery of the Americas
  - Columbus believed he had found the Indies — the name stuck even after the error was recognized
  - The **"sacred thirst of gold"** drove all subsequent Spanish expeditions — Cortes, Pizarro, Balboa
  - **Mining is the most ruinous of all projects** — "Of all those expensive and uncertain projects... there is none, perhaps, more perfectly ruinous than the search after new silver and gold mines"
  - The **philosopher's stone** analogy — the same passion that drives alchemy drove the search for El Dorado
  - English, French, Dutch, Danish colonies: no precious metals found, settled for other motives (religious freedom, escaping persecution)

#### Part II: Causes of the Prosperity of New Colonies (pp. 455-476)

- New colonies prosper because: **plenty of good land** + **liberty to manage their own affairs**
- Colonists bring **knowledge of agriculture and arts** superior to what savages develop over centuries
- **High wages, cheap land, no rent, few taxes** → every motive to maximize production
- **Liberal wages encourage population** — children's labour overpays their maintenance at maturity
- **English colonies prospered most** due to superior political institutions:
  1. **No engrossing of uncultivated land** — colony law required improvement within a limited time, or land became grantable to others
  2. **No primogeniture** (Pennsylvania) — land divided equally among children; free soccage tenure facilitates alienation
  3. **Lower taxes** — English colonists never contributed to mother country's defence; civil government costs only ~£64,700/year for all North American establishments — "a memorable example, at how small an expense three millions of people may not only be governed but well governed"
  4. **More extensive market** for surplus produce — non-enumerated commodities could be exported to all parts of the world
- **Enumerated vs. non-enumerated commodities**: Enumerated goods (molasses, coffee, tobacco, cotton, indigo, etc.) confined to British market; non-enumerated could go anywhere (though later restricted to countries south of Cape Finisterre)
- Britain **prohibited colonial manufacturing** — no steel furnaces, no slit-mills, no refining of sugar, no export of hats/wools between provinces — "a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind"
- But these prohibitions were **not yet very hurtful** because land was cheap and labour dear — colonies could import manufactures cheaper than they could make them
- **Exclusive companies** (Dutch, French) were "the worst of all governments for any country whatever" — Holland prospered only after dissolving its company; France's colonies thrived once freed from company monopoly
- **Slavery**: Smith notes the condition of slaves is better under **arbitrary government** (French colonies) than free government (English) — under free government, the master fears no magistrate; under despotic government, the magistrate can protect the slave from violence
- **"Folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over and directed the first project of establishing those colonies"** — the gold hunt, the injustice of coveting natives' lands

#### Part III: Of the Advantages Which Europe Has Derived from the Discovery of America, and from That of a Passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope (pp. 477-521)

- **General advantages** to Europe from America: (1) increase of enjoyments (new commodities), (2) augmentation of industry
- The surplus produce of America furnished Europe with commodities it could not otherwise have possessed — for convenience, pleasure, and ornament
- Even countries like Hungary and Poland, which never traded directly with America, benefited through the circulation of trade
- **The exclusive trade of mother countries tends to diminish** enjoyments and industry below what they would otherwise be — it is "a dead weight" on the business of mankind
- The **particular advantages** each colonizing country derives are: (1) common advantages every empire gets from provinces (military force, revenue), and (2) peculiar advantages from the exclusive trade
- **European colonies never furnished military force or revenue** — they have been "a source of expense, and not of revenue" to their mother countries
- The colonies of Spain and Portugal contributed nothing to defence; taxes rarely covered civil government costs
- The **monopoly is the principal badge of dependency** — the sole fruit Britain has gathered from colonialism
- **Monopoly's effects on Britain** — five harmful consequences:
  1. Continually **drawing capital from all other trades** into the colony trade
  2. Keeping the **rate of profit higher** in all branches than free trade would allow
  3. Turning trade from **neighbouring to distant** markets (less productive employment)
  4. Forcing capital from **direct to round-about** foreign trade of consumption
  5. Rendering Britain's whole commercial system **less secure** — like "an unwholesome body in which some of the vital parts are overgrown"
- **"To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of customers, may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of shopkeepers"** — but perfectly fit for a nation whose government is influenced by shopkeepers
- The **expense of the colonies** has been enormous — the late war (Seven Years' War) cost over 90 million sterling, and was "altogether a colony quarrel"
- **"Under the present system of management, Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion she assumes over her colonies"**
- Smith's radical proposal: **Britain should voluntarily give up the colonies** — she would save the expense and could negotiate a free trade treaty more advantageous than the monopoly
- No nation has ever voluntarily given up dominion over a province — the proposal will never be adopted
- Alternative: **colonial representation in Parliament** — the colonies taxed by parliamentary requisition or granted seats
- Smith sees **American representation** as potentially beneficial to the British constitution — "that assembly which deliberates concerning the affairs of every part of the empire... ought certainly to have representatives from every part of it"
- Remarkably prophetic: **"The seat of the empire would then naturally remove itself"** to America when American taxation exceeded British — within a century, the American contribution might surpass Britain's
- **"The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind"**
- To the natives, however, these discoveries brought "dreadful misfortunes" — but perhaps someday, mutual communication of knowledge and commerce may inspire equality and mutual respect
- **East India companies**: The Dutch and English companies have been destructive to the countries they govern
  - Dutch burn excess spices, reduce populations of the Moluccas, plough up rice fields for poppies
  - English company in Bengal follows "exactly the same tendency" — "perfectly destructive"
  - **"Nothing can be more directly contrary to the real interest of those companies, considered as sovereigns, than this destructive plan"** — a sovereign's revenue depends on the people's revenue
  - **"A company of merchants... are incapable of considering themselves as sovereigns"** — trade is still their principal business; they regard sovereignty "as but an appendix to that of the merchant"
  - The company's servants trade on their own account, establishing secret monopolies "much more destructive" than the company's own
  - **"Such exclusive companies are nuisances in every respect"** — always inconvenient and destructive

### Chapter VIII: Conclusion of the Mercantile System (pp. 522-538)

- The mercantile system's two great engines: **encouragement of exportation** and **discouragement of importation**
- With some commodities, it follows the **opposite plan** — discouraging exportation and encouraging importation of **raw materials** to give domestic manufacturers cheap inputs
- **Wool export laws** — Smith's most scathing critique of mercantile legislation:
  - By Elizabeth's reign, exporting wool was made felony — the exporter could have his left hand cut off and be nailed in a market town; second offence = death
  - For the "honour of the national humanity" these statutes were never executed
  - The inland commerce of wool subjected to oppressive regulations — wool could only be packed in leather marked "WOOL or YARN" in 3-inch letters
  - Coastal counties: every wool owner within 10 miles of the sea must register fleeces with customs
  - **"Like the laws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all written in blood"**
- Export prohibitions on leather, metals, tools, and even **skilled workers** — artificers forbidden from emigrating; up to 12 months imprisonment and £500 fine for enticing them abroad
- **"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer"**
- In the mercantile system, **the consumer is constantly sacrificed** to the producer — production, not consumption, is treated as the ultimate end of commerce
- **"A great empire has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers"** — the home consumer burdened with the whole expense of maintaining and defending this empire; more than £200 million spent in the last two wars alone

### Chapter IX: Of the Agricultural Systems (Physiocrats) (pp. 539-561)

- The **Physiocratic system** (the "Economistes") represents the produce of land as the sole source of revenue and wealth — adopted by "a few men of great learning and ingenuity in France"
- Founded in reaction to **Colbert's policies** — Colbert's mercantile system favoured towns over country, prohibited corn export, imposed degrading taxes on cultivators
- **"If the rod be bent too much one way, in order to make it straight, you must bend it as much the other"** — the Physiocrats overvalued agriculture as Colbert had overvalued manufactures
- Three classes in the Physiocratic system:
  1. **Proprietors** of land
  2. **Cultivators** (farmers/labourers) — the "productive class"
  3. **Artificers, manufacturers, merchants** — the "barren or unproductive class" (merely reproduce the value of their own consumption)
- Smith's critique: calling manufacturers "barren and unproductive" is **improper** — their labour does fix itself in vendible commodities, unlike that of menial servants
- Farmers are not necessarily more productive than manufacturers — both augment wealth; revenue can increase by improvement of productive powers OR by increase in labour quantity
- **"This system, however, with all its imperfections, is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy"**
- Smith praises the Physiocrats for representing **perfect liberty** as the most effectual expedient for increasing wealth
- **Marquis de Mirabeau**: "three great inventions which have principally given stability to political societies" — writing, money, and the Economical Table
- **China, ancient Egypt, Indostan** — examples of nations that favoured agriculture over manufactures and foreign trade; all prospered through large internal markets
- Ancient Greece and Rome **discouraged manufacturing** — considered occupations fit only for slaves; free citizens excluded from trades
- **"All systems, either of preference or of restraint, being thus completely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord"**
- The sovereign has only **three duties**: (1) protecting society from violence/invasion, (2) protecting every member from injustice/oppression (exact administration of justice), (3) erecting and maintaining certain public works and institutions unprofitable for private enterprise

#### Appendix to Book IV (pp. 562-563)

- Statistical tables on the **White-Herring Bounty** (Tonnage Bounty) in Scotland, 1771-1781
- Detailed accounts of busses, barrels caught, bounties paid — illustrating the arguments of Ch. 5 on bounties

## BOOK V: Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth

### Chapter I: Of the Expenses of the Sovereign or Commonwealth

#### Part I: Of the Expense of Defence (pp. 564-579)

- The **first duty** of the sovereign — protecting society from violence and invasion — can only be performed by military force
- The expense of this military force varies with the state of society and period of improvement
- **Four stages of military organization**, corresponding to stages of society:
  1. **Nations of hunters** (lowest state) — every man is a warrior; no expense to the sovereign; armies rarely exceed 200-300 men
  2. **Nations of shepherds** (Tartars, Arabs) — every man still a warrior; the whole tribe marches together; armies can reach 200,000-300,000; maintained by their own herds and flocks at no cost to the sovereign
  3. **Nations of husbandmen** (agricultural) — not the whole people but perhaps a fourth or fifth can take the field; campaigns must fit between seedtime and harvest; the sovereign bears little expense if wars are short
  4. **Commercial/manufacturing nations** — artificers and manufacturers cannot leave their work without total loss of income; the public must maintain soldiers while they serve; only ~1% of population can be soldiers without ruining the economy
- **Two causes** make it impossible for those who take the field to maintain themselves: (1) progress of manufactures, and (2) improvement in the art of war
- The art of war becomes "very intricate and complicated" — the division of labour applies to it as to every other art; it must become the **sole occupation of a particular class** (standing army)
- **Militia vs. Standing Army** — the central debate:
  - A **militia**: soldiers derive subsistence from another occupation; the character of labourer/tradesman predominates over that of soldier
  - A **standing army**: military exercises are the sole occupation; the soldier character predominates
  - **"A militia, in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or exercised, must always be much inferior to a well disciplined and well exercised standing army"**
- **Before firearms**: the army with greatest individual skill and dexterity was superior; strength and agility of body were of the highest consequence
- **After firearms**: regularity, order, and prompt obedience to command matter more than individual dexterity; a standing army's discipline gives it decisive superiority
- **Historical proof** — three great revolutions decided by standing armies over militias:
  1. **Fall of Greek republics and Persian empire** — Philip of Macedon's standing army defeated all Greek militias and the Persian empire
  2. **Fall of Carthage** — Rome's militia, through prolonged campaigning, became a de facto standing army and defeated Carthage
  3. **Fall of the Western Roman Empire** — Roman standing army decayed through luxury and neglect; Germanic/Scythian militias (shepherd peoples) overwhelmed it
- After the fall of Rome, feudal militias gradually gave way to standing armies as arts and industry advanced and people had less time for military exercises
- **Standing armies and liberty**: Men of republican principles have been jealous of standing armies as dangerous to liberty
  - But where the sovereign is himself the general, and nobility are chief officers, a standing army **can never be dangerous to liberty**
  - It may even be **favourable to liberty** — the security it gives the sovereign renders unnecessary the "troublesome jealousy" of watching every citizen
  - **"That degree of liberty which approaches to licentiousness, can be tolerated only in countries where the sovereign is secured by a well regulated standing army"**
- **Expense of defence grows with civilization**: firearms made both preparing and employing soldiers more expensive; fortification costs rose enormously
- **"In modern war, the great expense of firearms gives an evident advantage to the nation which can best afford that expense"** — favouring opulent/civilized nations over poor/barbarous ones
- The invention of firearms, though appearing pernicious, is **"certainly favourable, both to the permanency and to the extension of civilization"**

#### Part II: Of the Expense of Justice (pp. 579-583+)

- The **second duty** of the sovereign — protecting every member of society from injustice or oppression by every other member
- The expense of justice varies with different periods of society
- **Among hunters**: scarce any property; no established magistrate; no regular administration of justice needed
- **Property creates the need for government**: "Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality" — the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many
  - **"It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate, that the owner of that valuable property... can sleep a single night in security"**
  - The acquisition of valuable and extensive property **"necessarily requires the establishment of civil government"**
- **Four causes of subordination** that naturally introduce civil government:
  1. **Personal qualifications** — strength, beauty, wisdom, virtue (weakest basis; "invisible qualities")
  2. **Age** — universally respected; among hunters, age is the sole foundation of rank
  3. **Fortune/wealth** — greatest in the rudest ages; a Tartar chief maintaining 1,000 men has absolute authority over them; **"universal poverty establishes their universal equality"**
  4. **Birth** — presupposes ancient superiority of fortune; **"there never was, I believe, a great family in the world, whose illustration was entirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and virtue"**
- **Birth and fortune** are the two great sources of personal distinction and the principal causes that establish authority and subordination
- In the age of shepherds, inequality of fortune introduces civil government — the rich combine to defend their property; the institution of justice is in reality **"instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor"**

*[BATCH 9 COMPLETE — Book V Ch. I Parts I-II (pp. 564-583). Next: pp. 584-603]*

#### Part II: Of the Expense of Justice (continued, pp. 584-590)

- **Justice as revenue source**: Originally, the administration of justice was a **source of revenue** to the sovereign — presents always accompanied petitions; persons found guilty paid amercements (fines) to the sovereign
- Making justice subservient to revenue produced **gross abuses**: the person with the larger present got better justice; amercements incentivized finding defendants guilty even when innocent
- The corruption of justice in ancient European governments "appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt... far from being quite equal and impartial, even under the best monarchs"
- **Transition to fixed salaries**: When the sovereign's private estate became insufficient and taxes were needed, it was stipulated that **no present should be accepted** by judges; fixed salaries were appointed to compensate judges for the loss of their ancient fees
- **"Justice, however, never was in reality administered gratis"** — lawyers and attorneys are always paid by parties; fees paid to them amount to much more than judges' salaries
- **Court fees as incentive**: Where fees of court are paid after the process is decided, they become incentive to diligence; French parlements' *épices* system — a diligent judge earns more from fees distributed by hours worked
- **Competition between courts**: English courts of King's Bench, Exchequer, and Chancery competed for business — each expanded jurisdiction through legal fictions; this competition "formed by emulation" the admirable English legal system
- **Stamp duties** on law proceedings could fund courts without burdening general revenue — but courts might be tempted to multiply unnecessary proceedings
- **Separation of judicial from executive power**: arose from increasing business of society as improvement progressed
  - Administration of justice became too laborious for executive to handle alongside other duties
  - Roman consul delegated to the praetor; European monarchies delegated to bailiffs/judges
  - **"The judicial should be separated from the executive power"** and rendered as independent as possible — judges should not be removable at the caprice of the executive; salaries should not depend on the executive's good will

#### Part III: Of the Expense of Public Works and Public Institutions (pp. 590-598)

- The **third duty** — erecting and maintaining public institutions and public works that are highly advantageous but could **never repay the expense** to any individual or small number of individuals
- This duty requires different degrees of expense at different periods of society
- **Three subdivisions**: (1) facilitating commerce in general, (2) facilitating particular branches of commerce, (3) instructing the people

##### Article I: Of the Public Works and Institutions for Facilitating Commerce of the Society (pp. 590-598)

- **Roads, bridges, canals, harbours** — the expense increases with the annual produce and commerce of the country
- These public works may be self-funding through **tolls**: highway tolls, bridge tolls, canal lock-duties, harbour port-duties
  - **"It seems scarce possible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining such works"** — carriages pay in proportion to the wear they occasion
  - Tolls on luxury carriages (coaches, post-chaises) higher in proportion to weight than on carriages of necessity (carts, waggons) — **"the indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute... to the relief of the poor"**
- **Turnpike abuses in Britain**: trustees often corrupt; money levied is "more than double of what is necessary"; work "often executed in a very slovenly manner, and sometimes not executed at all"
- Smith critiques using turnpike tolls for general state revenue — if continually augmented, tolls would become a "great incumbrance" discouraging inland commerce
- **France vs. Britain**: French great post-roads (principal highways) kept in better order under central management; but French cross-roads (managed by corvées/forced labour) are neglected and oppressive
  - **Corvées** = forced labour on roads — "instruments of tyranny" in France; in Britain, the equivalent 6 days labour is "not always, perhaps, very judiciously applied, but it is scarce ever exacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression"
- **China and Asia**: executive power manages roads and canals directly; sovereign's revenue comes from land tax, so he has direct interest in maintaining infrastructure for agricultural prosperity
- **Local vs. central management**: works confined to a particular place are **always better maintained by local revenue** than by the general revenue of the state
  - If London streets were paved at Treasury expense, all taxpayers would subsidize London's convenience
- **Ambassadors and foreign ministers**: commerce necessitated maintaining permanent ambassadors — a custom unknown to ancient times, dating only from the 15th-16th century when commerce began extending itself across Europe

##### Of the Public Works and Institutions for Facilitating Particular Branches of Commerce (pp. 598-603+)

- Some branches of commerce with "barbarous and uncivilized nations" require extraordinary protection — fortified places needed on the coast of Africa, in India, etc.
- The expense of protecting particular branches should be defrayed by **a particular tax** on that branch — a moderate fine on entering the trade, or a percentage duty on imports/exports
- **Two types of trading companies**:
  1. **Regulated companies**: like corporations of trades — every qualified person admitted upon paying a fine; each member trades on own stock at own risk; resemble "enlarged monopolies"
  2. **Joint-stock companies**: members trade on a common joint stock, sharing profit/loss proportionally
- **Regulated companies' abuses**: the "corporation spirit" prevails — they confine competition, oppress trade through restrictive bye-laws
  - **Hamburgh Company**: now easy admission, no troublesome restraints — deserves eulogy
  - **Russia Company**: historically oppressive; admission fee reduced from £50+ to £5 by Act of Parliament
  - **Eastland Company**: admission reduced to 40 shillings
  - **Turkey Company**: worst offender — formerly an "oppressive monopoly"; admission was £25+ for those under 26, £50+ for older; restricted exports to London ships only; excluded all but freemen of London
    - Reformed by act of parliament — admission reduced to £20, exports opened from all ports
  - **African Company**: established 1750 (23rd George II c.51) as a regulated company to maintain forts between Cape Blanc and Cape of Good Hope; restricted from trading as a corporation or borrowing on common seal

*[BATCH 10 COMPLETE — Book V Ch. I Parts II-III through Article I (pp. 584-603). Next: pp. 604-623]*

##### Particular Branches of Commerce (continued, pp. 604-620)

- **African Company's failures**: Committee of nine accused of establishing "improper monopoly"; parliament allots £13,000/year for forts but oversight is weak — the cursitor baron of exchequer is not profoundly skilled in forts and garrisons
  - Committee accused of sending bricks and stones from England to repair Cape Coast Castle in Guinea — materials arrived in such bad quality the walls had to be rebuilt from the foundation
  - Forts north of Cape Rouge maintained at state expense under the executive power; those to the south maintained in part by the company — no good reason for the difference
- **Joint-stock companies** differ from regulated companies and private copartneries:
  1. Shares are **transferable** without consent of other members; value fluctuates on the market
  2. Each partner is bound only to the **extent of his share** (limited liability), unlike private copartneries where each partner is bound for the whole
- **"Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company"** — directors manage other people's money, not their own
  - **"Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it"**
- Joint-stock companies have **seldom been able to maintain competition against private adventurers** without exclusive privileges
- **Royal African Company**: had exclusive charter but couldn't compete with private adventurers; subjected them to 10% duty but still failed; stock and credit declined; debts became unmanageable; dissolved by parliament into present regulated company
- **Hudson's Bay Company**: more fortunate — very small capital (~£110,000), very few employees (~120 people), the ice limits shipping season to 6-8 weeks, creating a natural barrier to competition; moderate success though profits not as large as imagined
- **South Sea Company**: never had forts or garrisons; immense capital divided among enormous number of proprietors; folly, negligence, and profusion predictably prevailed
  - The Assiento Contract (slave trade to Spanish West Indies) — their only real trade; lost money on 8 of 10 Greenland whale voyages (total loss ~£237,000)
  - In 1722, petitioned to divide £33.8 million capital: half into government annuities, half remaining as trading stock; by 1733 further reduced to one-quarter trading stock
  - By Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, gave up the Assiento; remainder of trading stock became annuity stock; ceased to be a trading company
- **East India Company** — Smith's most detailed case study of joint-stock company failure:
  - Established 1600 by charter from Queen Elizabeth; first 12 voyages traded as a regulated company with separate stocks
  - United into joint stock 1612; capital never exceeded £744,000 initially
  - As principles of liberty advanced, it became doubtful whether royal charter alone (without act of parliament) could convey exclusive privilege
  - New East India Company established 1698 by subscribing £2 million loan to government at 8%
  - Old and new companies merged in 1702-1708 into the **United Company of Merchants trading to the East Indies**
  - Capital grew through successive government loans: £2 million → £3.2 million (1708-1743); dividends augmented from 6% to 10%
  - During French wars (1741-1763), the company took on military conquests: defended Madras, took Pondicherry, recovered Calcutta — acquired territorial revenues of ~£2.5-3 million/year
  - **"The great increase of their fortune had... only served to furnish their servants with a pretext for greater profusion, and a cover for greater malversation"**
  - By 1773, debts so great parliament had to intervene; regulations of 1773 did not end the disorder
  - Despite collecting £3 million+ in Calcutta treasury at one point, they wasted and destroyed "some of the richest and most fertile countries in India"
  - By 1784, in greater distress than ever — once more supplicating government for assistance
  - **"No other sovereigns ever were, or, from the nature of things, ever could be, so perfectly indifferent about the happiness or misery of their subjects"**
  - The company itself seems convinced of its own incapacity and "willing to give them up to government"
- **Temporary monopolies** may be justified for new trades with remote/barbarous nations — like patent monopolies for inventors; but upon expiration, the trade should be opened to all
  - **"By a perpetual monopoly, all the other subjects of the state are taxed very absurdly in two different ways"**: (1) high prices, (2) exclusion from a potentially profitable business
- **Four trades suitable for joint-stock companies** (without exclusive privilege) — where operations are reducible to routine:
  1. **Banking** — Bank of England, Bank of Edinburgh; principles reducible to strict rules; the principal banking companies in Europe are joint-stock companies
  2. **Insurance** (fire and marine) — London Assurance and Royal Exchange Assurance operate without exclusive privilege; 150 private insurers had failed before them
  3. **Navigable canals** — once made, management is simple and reducible to method
  4. **Water supply** for a great city — similarly routine
- Beyond these four, joint-stock companies generally do **more harm than good** — the "unavoidable partiality of their directors to particular branches of manufacture" distorts the natural allocation of capital

##### Article II: Of the Expense of the Institution for the Education of Youth (pp. 620-623+)

- Educational institutions may furnish revenue sufficient for their own expense through **fees paid by students**
- **Public endowments** of schools and colleges have come from local revenue, landed estates, or money funds managed by trustees
- Smith's provocative question: **"Have those public endowments contributed in general to promote the end of their institution?"**
  - Have they encouraged the diligence and improved the abilities of teachers?
  - Have they directed education towards more useful objects than it would have gone of its own accord?
- **The power of competition**: In every profession, exertion is proportional to necessity; where emoluments come solely from professional work, the rivalry of competitors "obliges every man to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness"
  - **"Great objects... are evidently not necessary, in order to occasion the greatest exertions"** — rivalship and emulation in even mean professions produce the greatest efforts
  - In England, success in law leads to great fortunes, "and yet how few men, born to easy fortunes, have ever in this country been eminent in that profession?"
- **Endowments diminish the necessity of application**: Teachers whose salaries are independent of their success have little incentive to teach well
  - At **Oxford**, "the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching"
  - Where the teacher is **prohibited from receiving fees** and salary is the whole revenue, "his interest is, in this case, set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it"
  - Where salary is only part of emoluments and fees from students make up the rest, the **necessity of application is not entirely taken away** — reputation still has some dependency
- **Extraneous jurisdiction** over teachers (by bishops, governors, outside bodies) is "liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously" — may render the teacher "one of the meanest and most contemptible persons in the society"
- **Forced attendance** undermines quality: privileges of graduates that require residence at certain universities force students there independent of teachers' merit; **scholarships and bursaries** attach students to particular colleges regardless of quality

*[BATCH 11 COMPLETE — Book V Ch. I Part III Article I (cont.) + Article II start (pp. 604-623). Next: pp. 624-643]*

##### Article II: Of the Expense of the Institution for the Education of Youth (continued, pp. 624-642)

- **Discipline of colleges is for the ease of masters, not benefit of students**: its object is to maintain the authority of the master and force students to behave "as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability"
  - **"Where the masters, however, really perform their duty, there are no examples, I believe, that the greater part of the students ever neglect theirs"**
  - **"No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending"**
- **Public schools vs. universities**: In England, public schools (grammar schools) are "much less corrupted" than universities — the youth are at least taught Greek and Latin, which masters are expected to teach; whereas in universities "the youth neither are taught, nor always can find any proper means of being taught"
  - The schoolmaster depends "principally, in some cases almost entirely, upon the fees or honoraries of his scholars" — no exclusive privileges, no forced attendance
- **Parts of education without public institutions are best taught**: fencing, dancing — where there are no institutions, the teacher depends entirely on reputation
  - **"The three most essential parts of literary education, to read, write, and account, it still continues to be more common to acquire in private than in public schools"**
- **History of university curriculum**: Universities originated as ecclesiastical corporations for educating churchmen
  - Latin became essential because of church service language
  - Greek and Hebrew entered university study through the Reformation — reformers needed original languages to expose errors in the Vulgate translation
  - **Ancient Greek philosophy** divided into three branches: physics (natural philosophy), ethics (moral philosophy), and logic
  - In European universities, this became five parts: logic first, then ontology/pneumatology (metaphysics), then physics, then moral philosophy (casuistry and ascetic morality)
  - **"This cobweb science of ontology"** — metaphysics composed mostly of "subtleties and sophisms"
  - Physics, "the proper subject of experiment and observation, a subject in which a careful attention is capable of making so many useful discoveries, was almost entirely neglected"
  - Modern improvements in philosophy have "not, the greater part of them, been made in universities" — universities were slow to adopt them; **"the richest and best endowed universities have been slowest in adopting those improvements"** and "chosen to remain, for a long time, the sanctuaries in which exploded systems and obsolete prejudices found shelter"
- **The Grand Tour critique**: English custom of sending young men abroad without university
  - **"A young man, who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen, and returns home at one-and-twenty, returns three or four years older than he was"** — but generally returns "more conceited, more unprincipled, more dissipated, and more incapable of any serious application"
  - **"Nothing but the discredit into which the universities are allowing themselves to fall, could ever have brought into repute so very absurd a practice"**
- **Ancient Greek and Roman education**:
  - Gymnastic exercises (military training) + music; in Rome, Campus Martius served same purpose as Greek Gymnasium
  - Romans had nothing corresponding to Greek musical education; their morals were superior nonetheless (attested by Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus)
  - Early education: reading, writing, arithmetic — acquired at home with domestic pedagogues (slaves/freedmen); the state appears not to have inspected or directed these
  - Philosophy schools: Zeno of Elea, Protagoras, Gorgias were travelling teachers; later, schools became stationary in Athens; state assigned places (Academy to Plato, Lyceum to Aristotle, Portico to Zeno of Citium)
  - **No teacher had any salary from the public until Marcus Antoninus**; the bounty from the emperor "probably lasted no longer than his own life"
  - Roman civil law became a science "very early" — studied not in public schools but by frequenting practitioners
- **Smith's remarkable insight on the division of labour and education**:
  - **"In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour... comes to be confined to a few very simple operations"**
  - The worker "has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention"
  - **"He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become"**
  - The torpor of mind renders him "incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation... of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment... of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life"
  - He is also rendered "incapable of defending his country in war" and "equally incapable of judging" the great interests of his country
  - **"His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues"**
  - In barbarous societies, every man has variety in occupations, keeps invention alive, is both warrior and statesman
  - In civilized society, the few who are "attached to no particular occupation" contemplate the "almost infinite variety" of occupations — rendering their understandings "in an extraordinary degree, both acute and comprehensive"
- **Smith's proposals for public education of the common people**:
  - The public should **facilitate, encourage, and even impose** education upon the whole body of the people
  - **Facilitate**: establish parish schools where children learn for a moderate reward (master paid partly, not wholly, by the public — otherwise he'd neglect his business); Scotland's parish schools have taught almost the whole population to read
  - **Encourage**: give small premiums and "little badges of distinction" to children who excel
  - **Impose**: require examination before any person can obtain freedom in any corporation or set up any trade — like the Greek requirement of military service
  - Teach **geometry and mechanics** instead of Latin — "the necessary introduction to the most sublime, as well as to the most useful sciences"
- **Military spirit of the people**: even if a standing army suffices for defence, a cowardly people is mutilated in "a still more essential part of the character of human nature"
  - **"A man without the proper use of the intellectual faculties of a man, is, if possible, more contemptible than even a coward"**
  - The state derives "no inconsiderable advantage" from instructed people: they are less liable to "delusions of enthusiasm and superstition"; more decent and orderly; more disposed to respect lawful superiors; better judges of government conduct
  - **"In free countries, where the safety of government depends very much upon the favourable judgment which the people may form of its conduct, it must surely be of the highest importance, that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or capriciously concerning it"**

##### Article III: Of the Expense of the Institutions for the Instruction of People of All Ages (pp. 643+)

- Institutions for instruction of people of all ages are **chiefly those for religious instruction** — a "species of instruction" aimed not at rendering people good citizens in this world but "for another and a better world in the life to come"
- **Two funding models** for clergy:
  1. **Voluntary contributions** of hearers — teachers depend entirely on zeal and industry; their exertion, zeal, and industry are "much greater" under this system
  2. **Established funds** — tithes, landed estates, salaries — teachers' subsistence is independent of their success; they "are apt gradually to lose the qualities... which had perhaps been the original causes of the success and establishment of their religion"
- **Established clergy become indolent and defenceless**: when attacked by "popular and bold, though perhaps stupid and ignorant enthusiasts," they feel "perfectly defenceless as the indolent, effeminate, and full fed nations of the southern parts of Asia" before the Tartars
  - Their only recourse is to call upon the civil magistrate to persecute dissenters
  - **"Every religious sect, when it has once enjoyed, for a century or two, the security of a legal establishment, has found itself incapable of making any vigorous defence against any new sect"**
- In England, the established church has "long neglected to keep up the fervour of faith and devotion in the great body of the people"

*[BATCH 12 COMPLETE — Book V Ch. I Part III Articles II-III (pp. 624-643). Next: pp. 644-663]*

##### Article III: Of the Expense of the Institutions for the Instruction of People of All Ages (continued, pp. 644-663)

- **Roman Catholic Church**: the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy is kept alive by self-interest more than in any established Protestant church
  - Parochial clergy derive subsistence from voluntary oblations and confession fees — "no plunder, no pay"
  - **Mendicant orders** (Dominicans, Franciscans) — like teachers wholly dependent on fees; their establishment in the 13th-14th century "revived, in the languishing faith and devotion of the catholic church"
  - The great dignitaries of the Church maintain discipline over inferiors but "seldom give themselves any trouble about the instruction of the people"
- **Hume quoted** (unnamed as "the most illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age"): the constant rule of the magistrate should be to **"leave the profession to itself, and trust its encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it"**
  - But clergy are an exception — if left to the market, each "ghostly practitioner" would infuse his religion with "superstition, folly, and delusion" to distinguish himself; "no regard will be paid to truth, morals, or decency"
  - Therefore the **wisest legislator** will bribe clergy into indolence with fixed salaries, making it "superfluous for them to be farther active"
  - Ecclesiastical establishments, though originating from religious views, **"prove in the end advantageous to the political interests of society"**
- **The danger of zealous clergy**: interested and active clergy are dangerous only where (1) one sect dominates entirely or (2) two or three great sects contend
  - **Smith's solution**: if society is divided into "two or three hundred, or perhaps into as many thousand small sects," none could be large enough to disturb the peace
  - Each teacher, "finding himself almost alone," would be obliged to respect every other sect — and this mutual respect would "in time, probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism"
  - This was the plan of the **Independents** proposed at the end of the English Civil War — established in **Pennsylvania** with the result of "the most philosophical good temper and moderation with regard to every sort of religious principle"
- **Two systems of morality** in every civilized society:
  1. **The liberal/loose system**: adopted by people of fashion — luxury, wanton mirth, pursuit of pleasure are treated with indulgence
  2. **The strict/austere system**: adopted by the common people — the vices of levity "are always ruinous to the common people, and a single week's thoughtlessness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever"
  - Almost all religious sects have begun among the common people and adopted the austere system
- **The man of low condition in a great city**: sunk in "obscurity and darkness"; his conduct "observed and attended to by nobody" — he abandons himself to profligacy and vice
  - But by joining a small religious sect, "he from that moment acquires a degree of consideration which he never had before" — the sect watches his conduct; morals of sect members are "almost always remarkably regular and orderly"
  - The morals of little sects can be "disagreeably rigorous and unsocial"
- **Two remedies** for excessive rigor of small sects:
  1. **Science and philosophy**: the state should make their study universal among people of "middling or more than middling rank" — **"Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition"**
  2. **Public diversions**: painting, poetry, music, dancing, dramatic representations — these dissipate "that melancholy and gloomy humour which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition and enthusiasm"
- **Church and state relations — historical overview**:
  - Where the law favours no one religion, the sovereign need have no dependency on clergy and no concern about them
  - Where there is an established church, the sovereign must be able to **influence** it — through fears and expectations of preferment
  - Benefices of clergy are **freeholds** (life tenure) — making it dangerous to use force against them; "fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of government"
  - **"Management and persuasion are always the easiest and the safest instruments of government"**
- **The medieval Church as a power structure**:
  - The clergy formed **"a sort of spiritual army, dispersed in different quarters"** — all directed by one head (the Pope), operating across national borders
  - Each national clergy was a "particular detachment" that could be supported by all others — "not only independent of the sovereign of the country... but dependent upon a foreign sovereign"
  - The clergy possessed in **tithes** "a very large portion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of Europe"
  - Revenues paid in kind (corn, wine, cattle) — with no arts or manufactures, the surplus could only be spent on **hospitality and charity**, maintaining retainers just as great barons did
  - "Both the hospitality and the charity of the ancient clergy... maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom"
  - **10th-13th centuries**: the Church of Rome was "the most formidable combination that ever was formed against the authority and security of civil government, as well as against the liberty, reason, and happiness of mankind"
  - Human reason alone could never have dissolved the ties of private interest supporting superstition — **"that immense and well-built fabric, which all the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken, much less have overturned"** was destroyed by commerce
- **How commerce destroyed Church power** (same mechanism as for feudal barons):
  - Manufactures and commerce gave clergy something to spend their revenue on personally
  - Their charity and hospitality gradually decreased; retainers dwindled; ties of dependence dissolved
  - The clergy wanted **better rents** from their landed estates — granted leases, making tenants independent
  - These ties dissolved "even sooner than those which bound the same ranks of people to the great barons" because church benefices were smaller than baronial estates
- **The Reformation** — Smith's political economy analysis:
  - The papal court's authority was in decline; sovereigns tried to recover influence over church appointments (pragmatic sanction, concordat)
  - The new doctrines "received everywhere a high degree of popular favour" — the reformers had better knowledge of ecclesiastical history, austere morals, and popular arts of gaining converts
  - Princes who happened to be on bad terms with Rome easily established the Reformation in their dominions (smaller German princes, Sweden under Gustavus Vasa, Denmark)
  - **Henry VIII** did not embrace Reformation doctrines but used their general prevalence to suppress monasteries and abolish Rome's authority
  - In **Scotland**, the government was too weak and unpopular — the Reformation overthrew both the Church and the state's attempt to support it
- **Two principal sects** of the Reformation:
  1. **Lutheran** (Church of England): preserved episcopal government; sovereign disposed of all bishoprics and consistorial benefices — became real head of the church; **"favourable to peace and good order, and to submission to the civil sovereign"**
     - Clergy cultivate the esteem of the court and nobility through learning, manners, and contempt for fanatics
     - But they are "very apt to neglect altogether the means of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower ranks"
  2. **Calvinist/Presbyterian**: equality of authority and benefice among clergy
     - Popular election of pastors led to factionalism and fanaticism — "the most fanatical candidate" preferred
     - Magistrates in Switzerland, Holland, and Scotland assumed the right of presentation to prevent disorder
     - Where patronage rights are established, Presbyterian clergy are **"a more learned, decent, independent, and respectable set of men"** than elsewhere — clergy of Holland, Geneva, and Scotland cited as examples
     - **Equality of benefice** forces exemplary morals — "nothing but exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune"
     - Presbyterian clergy have **"more influence over the minds of the common people, than perhaps the clergy of any other established church"**
     - In Presbyterian countries only is the common people found "converted, without persecution completely, and almost to a man, to the established church"
- **Where church benefices are very large** (university chairs being better than church livings), the church drains talent from universities; where benefices are moderate, universities retain the best minds
  - Voltaire observed that Father Porée, a Jesuit, was the only great professor whose works were worth reading — in a country that produced so many eminent men of letters, it was singular that scarce one had been a university professor
  - Cassendi was advised to leave his university professorship for the Church to get "a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence"

---

### Chapter I, Part III — Article III continued: Church Revenue and State (pp. 664-666)

- **Protestant vs. Catholic universities**: In Geneva, Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark — the most eminent men of letters have been university professors; in Catholic countries the church continually drains universities of talent
  - Teaching is "the natural employment of a mere man of letters" — the mediocrity of church benefices in Protestant countries draws talent to universities instead
- **Church revenue as a branch of state revenue**: The tithe is effectively a **real land tax** — it diverts revenue from the defence of the state; the more given to the church, the less the state can spare
  - **"The more of this fund that is given to the church, the less, it is evident, can be spared to the state"**
  - Land rent is the sole fund in all great monarchies from which the state must ultimately be supplied
- **Church of Scotland as proof of efficiency**: In 1755, the whole revenue of the Church of Scotland clergy (including glebe lands, rents, and manses) amounted to only £68,514:1s:5d — a "very moderate revenue" supporting 944 ministers
  - Total church expense (building, repairs, manses) under £80,000–£85,000/year
  - **"The most opulent church in Christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith, the fervour of devotion, the spirit of order, regularity, and austere morals, in the great body of the people, than this very poorly endowed church of Scotland"**
- Swiss protestant churches similarly well-managed — in some cantons, not a single person refuses to profess the established church; such thoroughness "could never have been executed in such free countries, had not the diligence of the clergy beforehand converted to the established church the whole body of the people"
- **Proper proportion of pay to service**: underpaid services suffer from "meanness and incapacity"; overpaid services suffer from "negligence and idleness" — a man of large revenue thinks he ought to live like other rich men, spending on "vanity and dissipation"

### Chapter I, Part IV: Of the Expense of Supporting the Dignity of the Sovereign (pp. 666-667)

- A certain expense is required to support the sovereign's **dignity** — this varies with periods of improvement and forms of government
- In an opulent society, all orders grow more expensive in houses, furniture, dress, equipage — **the sovereign cannot hold out against the fashion** and must naturally grow more expensive too
- A monarch, raised higher above subjects in dignity than a republican magistrate, requires greater expense — **"We naturally expect more splendour in the court of a king, than in the mansion-house of a doge or burgo-master"**

### Chapter I — Conclusion (pp. 667-668)

- **Defence**: should be funded by general contribution of the whole society, members contributing in proportion to their abilities
- **Justice**: may properly be funded by particular contributions of those who benefit (court fees), except criminal prosecution which requires general contribution
- **Roads and communications**: most beneficial to those who travel or carry goods — turnpike tolls and peages properly discharge the general revenue of this burden
- **Education and religion**: may be funded by general contribution, but "might, perhaps, with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether by those who receive the immediate benefit"
- **Public works** whose benefit is local should be funded locally, not burdening general revenue

---

## CHAPTER II: Of the Sources of the General or Public Revenue of the Society (pp. 668-675)

- The revenue must defray not only defence and dignity, but **all other necessary expenses** for which the constitution has not provided particular revenue
- Sources of public revenue: (1) funds **peculiarly belonging** to the sovereign (independent of the people), or (2) the **revenue of the people** (taxes)

### Part I: Funds Peculiarly Belonging to the Sovereign (pp. 668-675)

- These funds consist of either **stock** or **land**
- **Stock revenue**: the sovereign may derive revenue from stock by employing it (profit) or lending it (interest)
  - A Tartar chief's revenue = profit from his herds and flocks; only in the "earliest and rudest state" has profit been a principal part of public revenue
- **Mercantile projects of states**: Small republics (Hamburg, Venice, Amsterdam) have profited from public banks and mercantile ventures
  - The **post-office** is the only mercantile project successfully managed by every government — capital is small, returns certain and immediate
  - Princes who become merchants "have scarce ever succeeded" — their agents treat the prince's wealth as inexhaustible, are careless in buying and selling
  - **"No two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and sovereign"** — the East India Company's trading spirit made them bad sovereigns, and their sovereignty made them bad traders
- **Public bank profits**: Bank of England dividend at 5.5%, capital £10.78 million, net annual profit £5,292,000 — but whether a "slothful" government like England's could manage a bank well is "a good deal more doubtful"
  - Democracies prone to "thoughtless extravagance" in war and peace alike
- **Canton of Berne**: derives considerable revenue by lending treasury to foreign states (France, England) — security depends on the debtor nation's good faith and probability of peace
- **Hamburg's pawn-shop** (lombard): lends to subjects at 6% on pledges — revenue = 150,000 crowns (£33,750)
- **Pennsylvania paper money**: government lent paper bills at interest on land security (double value), redeemable in 15 years, made legal tender — raised moderate revenue defraying annual expenses of ~£4,500
  - Success depended on: (1) demand for circulating medium besides gold/silver, (2) credit of government, (3) moderation in issuance — paper never exceeding gold/silver that would otherwise be needed
  - Other American colonies adopted same expedient but "from want of this moderation... produced much more disorder than conveniency"
- **Land as public revenue**: land rent is the most **stable and permanent** fund — "that sure, steady, and permanent revenue, which can alone give security and dignity to government"
  - Ancient republics (Greece, Italy) derived the greater part of revenue from public lands
  - Crown lands of medieval Europe: originally sufficient for all government expenses in peacetime — lord treasurer, lord chamberlain, lord steward, lord constable, lord marshal were household officers
  - **Modern state**: rent of all lands combined (even if under one proprietor) would barely equal ordinary revenue needed; war and public debt have made the old system impossible
  - Britain's land tax at 4 shillings/pound: ordinary revenue (£10 million+) doesn't exceed what lands could produce; but land tax falls short at £2 million/year — assessed far below real value
  - Land rent estimated at £20 million; the people's revenue from land is **not to the rent, but to the produce** — the whole annual produce, minus seed, is either consumed or exchanged
- **Crown lands should be sold**: crown lands are badly managed (negligent, expensive agents); private owners would improve them; increased population and consumption would raise customs and excise revenue
  - In countries with improved lands, crown lands sell at 30 years' purchase; unimproved crown lands might sell at 40-60 years' purchase
  - **"Lands, for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence, parks, gardens, public walks, etc.... seem to be the only lands which, in a great and civilized monarchy, ought to belong to the crown"**
- **Conclusion of Part I**: Public stock and public lands being "improper and insufficient" for defraying state expenses, taxes must supply the greater part of revenue

### Part II: Of Taxes (pp. 676-683)

- Private revenue arises from **rent, profit, and wages** — every tax must fall on one or more of these
- **Smith's Four Maxims of Taxation**:
  1. **Equality**: Subjects should contribute in proportion to their respective abilities — "in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state"; the expense of government is like the expense of managing a great estate, tenants contributing proportionally
  2. **Certainty**: The tax must be **certain and not arbitrary** — "the time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other person"; uncertainty "encourages the insolence, and favours the corruption" of tax-gatherers; **"The certainty of what each individual ought to pay is, in taxation, a matter of so great importance, that a very considerable degree of inequality... is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty"**
  3. **Convenience**: Every tax should be levied at the time and manner most convenient for the contributor — rent taxes payable at same term as rent; taxes on consumable luxuries paid "little and little" at purchase
  4. **Economy**: Every tax should take out as little as possible beyond what it brings into the treasury — four ways a tax can drain more than it yields: (a) requiring a great number of revenue officers, (b) obstructing industry and discouraging business, (c) forfeitures and penalties ruining unsuccessful evaders and destroying their capital, (d) subjecting people to "frequent visits and the odious examination of the tax-gatherers"
  - **"An injudicious tax gives a great temptation to smuggling"** — the law creates the temptation then punishes those who yield; penalties ought to alleviate, not aggravate, the temptation

#### Article I: Taxes upon Rent — Taxes upon the Rent of Land (pp. 678-683)

- A land tax may be imposed on: (1) a **fixed valuation** (invariable canon), or (2) a **variable rate** that rises and falls with actual rent
- **Fixed valuation** (like Great Britain's land tax): originally equal, it becomes **unequal over time** as cultivation improves or declines in different areas
  - Britain's land tax assessed by William and Mary's 4th year valuation — perfectly certain, convenient, but offends maxim of equality
  - Landlords have **gained** from the constancy of valuation as rents have generally risen since establishment; the sovereign has lost correspondingly
  - Changes in silver value or coinage standards could have made the fixed valuation advantageous or hurtful in different ways
- **The Physiocrats' (économistes') proposal**: a land tax varying with every variation in rent — they claim all taxes ultimately fall on land rent, so tax it directly
  - Such a tax would be "certainly more equal" than a fixed one
  - But it might be less certain, more troublesome to the landlord, and more expensive to levy (requiring register-offices in every district)
- **Venetian system**: arable lands taxed at a tenth of rent; leases recorded in a public register; owner-cultivated land assessed by arbitration of neighbours with a one-fifth deduction
- **Rents in kind** (corn, cattle, wine) and **fines for lease renewal**: both hurtful practices — rents in kind take more from tenant than they give to landlord; fines let spendthrift landlords sell future revenue for ready money
  - Tax policy should **discourage** these practices by valuing them higher for tax purposes
- **Landlord-prescribed cultivation**: leases requiring specific crop rotation reflect "the landlord's conceit of his own superior knowledge (a conceit in most cases very ill-founded)" — should be taxed to discourage it
- **Variable land tax advantages**: would give the sovereign an interest in encouraging improvement; should allow the landlord a period of indemnification before reassessment, but not too long lest remoteness discourage attention
  - **"No incitement to the attention of the sovereign can ever counterbalance the smallest discouragement to that of the landlord"**
  - Such a tax would "readily suit itself to the actual situation of things" — adapting to all variations in society, agriculture, silver value, and coinage

#### Article I continued: Land Tax Surveys and Valuations (pp. 684-685)

- **Actual surveys vs. lease registers**: some states suspect lessor and lessee may collude to conceal true rent, so they conduct expensive surveys and valuations instead
  - **Domesday Book** appears to be the result of such a survey
- **Prussian land tax**: assessed according to actual survey and valuation, reviewed and altered periodically
  - Silesia: noble tenure taxed 3% higher than base tenure — honours and privileges compensate
  - Lay proprietors pay 20-25% of rent; ecclesiastics pay 40-50% — church revenue is a burden on land rent, seldom applied to improvement
- **Bohemia survey**: work of more than a hundred years, not perfected until after 1748 peace
- **Duchy of Milan**: survey begun under Charles VI, perfected after 1760 — "one of the most accurate that has ever been made"
- **Savoy and Piedmont**: survey by the late king of Sardinia
- **Montauban (France)**: predial taille assessed by exact survey in 1666; by 1727, completely unequal again — government's remedy was an additional tax of 120,000 livres levied on under-taxed districts to relieve over-taxed ones
  - Application is at the intendant's discretion — "in a great measure arbitrary"
- **A land tax based on general survey** will become unequal over time — maintaining it requires "continual and painful attention" that is unsustainable for most governments

#### Taxes Proportioned to Produce, Not Rent (pp. 686-688)

- Taxes on **produce** (like the tithe) are really taxes on rent — the farmer computes his liability and makes a proportionate abatement in his rent to the landlord
- **The tithe is a very unequal tax on rent**: on rich lands, produce is so great that half replaces the farmer's capital with profit; on poor lands, four-fifths of produce goes to replacing capital, leaving very little rent
  - A tenth of produce on rich land = one-fifth of rent; on poor land = one-half of rent
  - **"The tythe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is always a great discouragement, both to the improvements of the landlord, and to the cultivation of the farmer"**
- The church, which lays out no expense, shares largely in the profit of the most expensive improvements — the most valuable crops
  - **Madder cultivation**: confined to the United Provinces (Presbyterian, no tithe) for a long time; tithe exemption gave Dutch a monopoly on this dyeing drug; England only introduced madder after a statute substituted 5 shillings/acre in lieu of tithe
- **Asian land taxes** are proportioned to produce, not rent — in China, the sovereign's principal revenue is a tenth of produce (estimated very moderately, ~one-thirtieth of ordinary produce in many provinces)
  - This land tax interests the sovereign in improvement — Chinese and Egyptian sovereigns were extremely attentive to canals and roads
  - **Church tithes**: divided into small parish portions, no proprietor has an interest in making roads or canals; "The parson of a parish could never find his account in making a road or a canal"
- **Taxes on produce levied in kind vs. money**:
  - In kind: produce of tax varies only with real produce of the land
  - In money according to variable market valuation: varies with both produce and value of precious metals
  - In money according to fixed valuation (modus): same nature as the English land tax — neither rises nor falls with rent
- **Bengal under East India Company**: exchanged the modus (fixed money payment) for payment in kind in some provinces — likely to discourage cultivation and increase abuse opportunities

#### Taxes upon the Rent of Houses (pp. 689-694)

- House rent has **two parts**: (1) **building-rent** (profit on capital invested in building), and (2) **ground-rent** (what the inhabitant pays for the use of the ground)
- **Building-rent** is regulated by the ordinary interest rate — must be sufficient to replace builder's capital with interest and keep the house in repair; at 4% interest, a house renting at 6-6.5% above ground-rent affords a sufficient profit
- **Ground-rent** is highest in the capital and wherever demand for housing is greatest — for trade, business, pleasure, vanity, or fashion
- A tax on house-rent, proportioned to the **whole rent**, cannot affect building-rent for any considerable time (builders would quit the trade otherwise) — in the long run, **"the whole of it must necessarily fall upon the ground-rent"**
  - The tax divides itself: partly upon the inhabitant (who gives up some convenience), partly upon the ground-owner
- **House-rent taxes fall heaviest on the rich** — "A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be any thing very unreasonable"
  - **"It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion"**
- **House rent vs. land rent**: Land rent is paid for a **productive** subject; house rent is paid for an **unproductive** subject — neither the house nor the ground produces anything; the person paying must draw from some other revenue source
  - A tax on houses is therefore like a tax on any consumable commodity — falls indifferently on all three sources of revenue
- **House-rent as measure of wealth**: "there is not, perhaps, any one article of expense or consumption by which the liberality or narrowness of a man's whole expense can be better judged of than by his house-rent"
  - A proportional tax on house-rent "might, perhaps, produce a more considerable revenue than any which has hitherto been drawn from it in any part of Europe"
- **Uninhabited houses** should pay no tax — taxing the proprietor for a house yielding no revenue would be taxing him for "neither conveniency nor revenue"
  - Houses should be rated by **equitable arbitration** of what they would bring if leased, not by building cost
- **Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation** than house rents — a tax on ground-rent would fall altogether on the ground-owner (a monopolist); would not raise the rent of houses; would not discourage building or any industry
  - Ground-rents owe their existence entirely to **good government** — they should be taxed peculiarly
  - **"Nothing can be more reasonable, than that a fund, which owes its existence to the good government of the state, should be taxed peculiarly"**
- **In Great Britain**, rent of houses taxed in same proportion as land (same annual valuation) — originally extremely unequal, continues so; in most of the kingdom, falls more lightly on houses than on land
- **History of English house taxes**:
  1. **Hearth-money**: tax of 2 shillings per hearth — required tax-gatherer to enter every room; abolished soon after the Revolution as "a badge of slavery"
  2. **Tax of 2 shillings** per dwelling-house inhabited — crude, didn't distinguish rich from poor
  3. **Window tax**: houses with 10 windows pay 4 shillings; 20 windows pay 8 shillings; graduated upward
  - **Principal objection to window taxes**: their inequality — "inequality of the worst kind, as they must frequently fall much heavier upon the poor than upon the rich"
  - A 10-pound country house may have more windows than a 500-pound London house; the country inhabitant is likely poorer
  - Despite the tax, house rents have on the whole risen — demand for houses has increased more than the window tax could sink them

#### Article II: Taxes upon Profit, or upon the Revenue Arising from Stock (pp. 695-703)

- Profit from stock divides into: (1) **interest** (belongs to owner of stock) and (2) **surplus above interest** (compensates risk and trouble of employing the stock)
  - The surplus is "no more than a very moderate compensation for the risk and trouble" — **not properly taxable directly**; if taxed, the employer must either raise the rate of profit or charge the whole tax upon the interest of money
- **Why interest on money is less proper for direct taxation than land rent**:
  1. The **quantity and value of land** is always known; the capital stock a man possesses is "almost always a secret" — liable to continual variation, "frequently not a single day" the same
  2. **Land cannot be removed; stock can easily be moved** — the proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen; the proprietor of stock "is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country"
  - **"A tax which tended to drive away stock from any particular country, would so far tend to dry up every source of revenue"** — not only profits but rent and wages would diminish
- **Nations have contented themselves with loose, arbitrary estimations** of stock — the extreme inequality and uncertainty is compensated by "extreme moderation" in rates; every man rates himself below his real revenue
- **England's land tax on stock**: intended to tax stock at same proportion as land (4 shillings/pound = one-fifth); when interest was 6%, every £100 stock taxed at 24 shillings (one-fifth of £6); since interest fell to 5%, stock is taxed at 20 shillings only — far below real value in both cases
  - In Westminster, tax is assessed on houses; in London, on stock and trade — both essentially assessed on houses or reputation
- **Hamburg's stock tax**: every inhabitant pays one-fourth per cent of all he possesses; self-assessed on oath, without declaring the amount — "the wealth of the people of Hamburg consists principally in stock, this tax may be considered as a tax upon stock"
  - Works only because of great public fidelity in a small republic where people trust their magistrates
- **Swiss cantons**: Underwald, Zurich, Basil — citizens declare their fortunes on oath in cases of necessity; assessed accordingly
  - At Hamburg and in Swiss cantons, requiring citizens to declare publicly is considered a hardship — "The ruin of their credit, and the miscarriage of their projects, they foresee, would too often be the consequence"
- **Holland's tax after Orange's exaltation**: 2% or the fiftieth penny on every citizen's whole substance — self-assessed; intended for a particular exigency, "too heavy to be permanent"
  - **"A tax of two per cent. upon the highest neat revenue... is a tax which very few people could pay, without encroaching more or less upon their capitals"** — would soon ruin them and render them "altogether incapable of supporting the state"

#### Taxes upon the Profit of Particular Employments (pp. 700-703)

- Extraordinary taxes sometimes imposed on profits of stock in **particular branches** of trade or agriculture
- A tax on dealers' profits in any branch **falls on consumers** — dealers must have their reasonable profit; where competition is free, they can seldom have more; consumers must pay the price advance, generally with some overcharge
- **Proportional vs. flat taxes on trades**: When proportioned to the trade, a tax occasions no oppression (paid by consumer); when a **flat fee** (same for all dealers), it **favours the great and oppresses the small** — e.g., a tax of 5 shillings/week on every hackney coach is proportional, but 20 shillings/year for a licence to sell ale is the same for all retailers, giving an advantage to the great
  - The tax on shops (proposed during a war) was wisely abandoned — would have forced all retail into the hands of great dealers, who as monopolists would have raised prices "much beyond what the tax could have occasioned"
- **France's personal taille**: the most important tax on agricultural profits in Europe
  - **Real taille**: imposed on lands held by ignoble tenure; necessarily unequal but not always arbitrary
  - **Personal taille**: imposed on supposed profits of farmers/leaseholders — "necessarily both arbitrary and unequal"
  - Personal taille (1775) imposed on twenty generalities (countries of elections), totalling 40,107,239 livres, 16 sous
  - Assessment varies year to year based on council reports about crops and circumstances — each generality divided into elections, elections into parishes
  - Both election and parish assessments are "more or less, under the direction and influence of the intendant" — subject to ignorance, misinformation, friendship, party animosity, and private resentment
  - **"No man subject to such a tax, it is evident, can ever be certain, before he is assessed, of what he is to pay. He cannot even be certain after he is assessed"**
  - If a contributor goes bankrupt, the collector must advance his tax; if the collector goes bankrupt, the parish must answer; reimposition always falls on the five or six richest contributors
- **Tax on agricultural stock discourages cultivation**: the farmer, needing stock for proper cultivation, cannot withdraw any without reducing his ability to pay rent or tax
  - The farmer can never raise the price of his produce to reimburse himself (unlike merchants) — the final payment of such a tax always falls on the **landlord** through reduced rent
  - **"The more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax, the less he can afford to pay in the way of rent"**
  - Where the personal taille applies, the farmer is assessed by the stock he appears to employ — "He is upon this account, frequently afraid to have a good team of horses or oxen, but endeavours to cultivate with the meanest and most wretched instruments of husbandry that he can"

#### Personal Taille's Effect on Cultivation (pp. 704)

- The farmer who counterfeits poverty and cultivates badly "does not, perhaps, always consult his own interest in the most effectual manner" — he loses more from diminished produce than he saves in tax
- The public and the landlord both suffer from degraded cultivation
- **"That the personal taille tends, in many different ways, to discourage cultivation, and consequently to dry up the principal source of the wealth of every great country, I have already had occasion to observe in the third book of this Inquiry"**

#### Poll-Taxes (pp. 704-705)

- **Poll-taxes on slaves**: proportioned not to supposed revenue but to supposed fortune — really taxes on agricultural profits; the planter is both farmer and landlord, so final payment falls on him as landlord
- Poll-taxes in **North America and West India islands** (so much per negro) are properly taxes on profits of agricultural stock
- **Bondmen taxes** (ancient Europe, Russia): anciently common; represented as "badges of slavery" — but every tax is "a badge, not of slavery, but of liberty"
- **Tax on servants** (Holland, Great Britain): not on stock but on expense — a guinea/head tax on man-servants "falls heaviest upon the middling rank"; a man of £200/year may keep one; a man of £10,000 will not keep fifty — does not affect the poor

#### Taxes on Profits in Particular Employments — continued (pp. 705)

- Taxes on profits of stock in particular employments can never affect the **interest of money** — nobody will lend for less to the taxed than to the untaxed
- Taxes on revenue from stock in all employments (vingtième in France, land tax in England) fall ultimately on the **interest of money**
- France's vingtième: assessed on revenue from land, houses, and stock — "with much more exactness" than England's land tax, though still falling on the same fund
- Money sunk in French **rentes** (perpetual annuities constituted for a rent, redeemable by debtor) — the vingtième has not raised the rate of these annuities

#### Appendix to Articles I and II: Taxes upon the Capital Value of Lands, Houses, and Stock (pp. 705-709)

- While property remains with the same person, permanent taxes diminish only **revenue**, not capital value
- But when property **changes hands** (death, gift, sale), taxes on the transfer "necessarily take away some part of its capital value"
- **Roman vicesima hereditatum** (twentieth penny of inheritances, imposed by Augustus): applied to all successions/legacies except nearest relations; direct successions to descendants pay only the twentieth penny
  - A father's death to children living with him "is seldom attended with any increase, and frequently with a considerable diminution of revenue" — taxing this would be "cruel and oppressive"
  - Children who are "foris-familiated" (emancipated, living independently) — their inheritance is a real addition; could be liable to some tax
- **Dutch tax on successions**: collateral successions taxed 5-30% according to degree of relation; husband-to-wife or wife-to-husband taxed at the fiftieth penny
  - The *luctuosa hereditas* (mournful succession) of ascendants to descendants = twentieth penny only; direct descendant successions pay nothing
- **Feudal casualties**: heir of every immediate vassal paid a year's rent (relief); if a minor, the whole rents devolved to the superior during minority; relief on coming of age was also a year's rent
  - Long minorities frequently disburden estates of encumbrances — but "the waste, and not the disincumbrance of the estate, was the common effect of a long minority"
- **Feudal alienation fines**: vassal could not sell without lord's consent — fine was at first arbitrary, later regulated as a proportion of the price
  - Canton of Berne: a sixth of noble fiefs, a tenth of ignoble ones
  - Canton of Lucerne: tax on land sales is not universal
- **Stamp duties and registration duties**: may or may not be proportioned to the value of property transferred
  - In Holland: all testaments on stamped paper (3 pence to 300 florins); stamps proportioned to property; this is over and above all other succession taxes
  - All deeds, bonds, contracts, bills of exchange = stamp duty (not proportioned to value of subject)
- **Great Britain**: stamp duties are higher or lower, **not proportioned to value** — an 18-penny stamp suffices for a bond of any sum; the highest duty = £6/sheet of parchment; these fall chiefly on grants from the crown and on law proceedings
  - Crown derives no revenue from registration fees (officers' fees only)
- **Taxes on property transfer from dead to living** fall on the persons receiving property
- **Taxes on sale of land** fall on the **seller** (who sells under necessity); taxes on sale of new-built houses fall on the **buyer** (regulated by demand)
- **Stamp duties and registration duties on bonds and mortgages** fall on the **borrower** — reduce the capital value of property in dispute
- **"All taxes upon the transference of property of every kind, so far as they diminish the capital value of that property, tend to diminish the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour"**
- They are "unthrifty taxes that increase the revenue of the sovereign... at the expense of the capital of the people, which maintains none but productive" labour
- **Registration of mortgages** is extremely advantageous to creditors and the public — but multiplying register-offices and requiring unnecessary registrations is a natural abuse in France ("several different sorts of secret registers")
- **Stamp duties on newspapers, pamphlets, licences** for ale, wine, spirits: properly taxes on consumption — final payment falls on consumers

#### Article III: Taxes upon the Wages of Labour (pp. 710-712)

- A direct tax on wages raises them **somewhat higher than the tax** — if wages are 10 shillings/week and the tax is one-fifth (4 shillings/pound), wages must rise not to 12 shillings but to 12 shillings and sixpence — so the labourer, after paying tax, has the same free wages
  - **"Whatever was the proportion of the tax, the wages of labour must, in all cases rise, not only in that proportion, but in a higher proportion"** — if the tax is one-tenth, wages must rise not one-tenth but one-eighth
- A direct tax on wages is ultimately advanced by the employer:
  - In **manufacturing**: the master manufacturer charges it to consumers with a profit, so the final payment falls on consumers
  - In **agriculture**: the farmer must employ a greater capital, retain a larger portion of produce, pay less rent — the final payment falls on the **landlord** through reduced rent, plus advanced price of manufactures
- **"In all cases, a direct tax upon the wages of labour must, in the long-run, occasion both a greater reduction in the rent of land, and a greater rise in the price of manufactured goods"**
- Where direct taxes on wages have not raised wages proportionally, it is because they have caused a **fall in the demand for labour** — "the declension of industry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the annual produce"
- **France's taille on workmen and day-labourers**: computed by district wage rates; yearly gains estimated at no more than 200 working days; tax varied by collector/commissary judgment — "Absurd and destructive as such taxes are"
- **Bohemia's tax on artificers** (after 1748): divided into four classes — highest pay 100 florins (£9:7:6), lowest 25 florins; varied by collector
- **England**: when the land tax was at 4 shillings/pound, a tax of 5 shillings and 6 pence/pound was levied on salaries over £100/year, pensions, and military/naval pay — no other direct taxes on wages in England
- **Taxes on emoluments of office**: the lucrative offices are "objects of general envy" — a tax on them is always popular; even if somewhat higher than on other revenue, "not very unreasonable"

#### Article IV: Taxes Which It Is Intended Should Fall Indifferently upon Every Different Species of Revenue (pp. 713-723)

**Capitation Taxes (pp. 713-715)**:
- If proportioned to fortune/revenue → **altogether arbitrary** (fortune varies day to day, requires intolerable inquisition renewed yearly)
- If proportioned to **rank** → **certain but unequal** (degrees of fortune frequently unequal in the same rank)
- **"Let the tax be light or heavy, uncertainty is always a great grievance. In a light tax, a considerable degree of inequality may be supported; in a heavy one, it is altogether intolerable"**
- **English poll-taxes** (William III): contributors assessed by rank — dukes, marquises, earls, etc.; all shop-keepers and tradesmen worth over £300 subject to same assessment regardless of fortune; several originally taxed by supposed income were later assessed by rank
  - English poll-taxes **never produced** what was expected — "the mild government of England, when it assessed the different ranks of people to the poll-tax, contented itself with what that assessment happened to produce"
- **French capitation** (since the beginning of the 18th century): highest orders rated by invariable tariff (rank); lower orders assessed by supposed fortune varying year to year
  - In the provinces, the capitation on those subject to the taille (the common people) is the least part; the largest portion is assessed as a supplement — "so much a-pound of what they pay to that other tax"
  - **Capitation taxes levied on the lower ranks = direct taxes on wages** — attended with all their inconveniences
  - But capitation taxes, "where they are rigorously exacted, afford a very sure revenue to the state"

**Taxes upon Consumable Commodities (pp. 715-723)**:
- **Necessaries vs. luxuries**:
  - **Necessaries**: not only things indispensable for life, but whatever "the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without"
    - A linen shirt is a necessary in England (for both sexes); leather shoes are necessary in England and Scotland; in France, the lowest rank may go barefoot without discredit
  - **Luxuries**: everything else — beer, wine in Great Britain; any article whose temperate use throws no reproach
- **Tax on necessaries operates exactly as a direct tax on wages**: raises prices → raises wages → final payment falls on employer → if manufacturer, charged to consumer with profit; if farmer, pays less rent to landlord
  - **"The middling and superior ranks of people, if they understood their own interest, ought always to oppose all taxes upon the necessaries of life, as well as all taxes upon the wages of labour"** — they pay both with considerable overcharge; they fall heaviest on landlords "in a double capacity"
- **Tax on luxuries** does NOT raise wages — the price rise does not necessarily diminish the ability of the poor to bring up families
  - Taxes on tobacco, tea, sugar, chocolate in England have had no effect on wages of labour
  - The rise in porter price (3 shillings/barrel additional tax on strong beer) has not raised London wages — still about 18-20 pence/day
  - **"Upon the sober and industrious poor, taxes upon such commodities act as sumptuary laws"** — increase their frugality; the sober poor who bring up the most numerous families are the ones who "principally supply the demand for useful labour"
  - The dissolute poor indulge regardless, bringing distress on their families — but "such disorderly persons, however, seldom rear up numerous families"
- **Taxes on the four principal necessaries** in Great Britain: **salt, leather, soap, and candles**
  - Salt: taxed at 3 shillings/bushel (~3x original price); very ancient, universal
  - Leather: 3.5 pence/pound (~8-10% of original price)
  - Soap: ~20-25% of original price
  - Candles: penny/pound (~14-15% of original price)
  - These are real necessaries — heavy taxes on them raise subsistence costs and consequently wages
  - **Sir Matthew Decker's observation**: in certain goods, taxes are "sometimes repeated and accumulated four or five times" — the price of leather includes not just the leather tax but the tax on the salt, soap, and candles consumed by the shoemaker and tanner
- **Fuel (coal)** is a real necessary in Britain — manufactures have concentrated in coal counties because other parts "not being able to work so cheap"; coal duties on coastwise transport are more than 60% of original pit-head price
  - The corn bounty, high import duties on grain, and prohibition of live cattle imports have all had bad effects — **"Nothing seems necessary for the repeal of such regulations, but to convince the public of the futility of that system in consequence of which they have been established"**
- **Taxes on bread and butcher's meat**: common in many countries; Holland's bread prices supposedly doubled by such taxes; a French author (*Le Réformateur*) proposed substituting a single tax on bread for all other taxes — "this most ruinous of all taxes"
  - **Whether butcher's meat is a necessary**: grain and vegetables, with milk, cheese, butter, oil, can provide the most wholesome and nourishing diet; "decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butcher's meat"
- **Two methods of taxing consumable commodities**:
  1. **While in the dealer's hands** (excise/customs) — most goods taxed this way
  2. **By annual licence to consume** (coach-tax, plate tax) — consumer pays once for durable goods
  - Durable goods (coach, plate) are better taxed by moderate annual payments than by a heavy one-time tax at purchase
- **Sir Matthew Decker's proposal**: tax all commodities (including immediate/speedy consumption) by annual consumer licence — the dealer advances nothing, enabling free trade and carrying trade
  - Smith identifies **four objections**: (1) the tax would be unequal — not well proportioned to actual consumption; (2) it would diminish the convenience of **piece-meal payment** (paying 3.5 pence for a pot of porter is voluntary; paying all at once for a year's worth could distress a workman); (3) it would not operate as a sumptuary law (the licence, once bought, taxes the sober and drunk equally); (4) workmen paying all at once in annual/quarterly sums would be frequently distressed
  - **"This mode of taxation, therefore, it seems evident, could never, without the most grievous oppression, produce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode"**

**Duties of Excise and Customs (pp. 722-723)**:
- **Excise duties**: imposed chiefly on goods of home production destined for home consumption — salt, soap, leather, candles, and "always the four duties above mentioned"
  - There can never be doubt about which goods are subject to excise, or what particular duty applies — "They fall almost altogether upon what I call luxuries, excepting always the four duties above mentioned"
- **Customs duties**: much more ancient than excise; seem to denote "customary payments" from time immemorial
  - Originally considered **taxes upon the profits of merchants** — in feudal times, merchants were despised bondmen whose gains were envied
  - The king who consented to tallage his own tenants' profits was not unwilling to tallage those of merchants he had less interest in protecting
  - **Alien vs. English merchants**: aliens taxed more heavily (spirit of monopoly); this distinction continued "from ignorance"
- **Three ancient branches of customs**:
  1. **Duty on wool and leather** — chiefly an exportation duty (protecting domestic woollen manufacture)
  2. **Tonnage** — on wine by the tun
  3. **Poundage** — on all other goods by value; Edward III: 6 pence/pound on exports and imports; Richard II: 1 shilling; later reduced to 6 pence; Henry IV: 8 pence; finally settled at 1 shilling/pound from the 9th year of William III
  - **"The subsidy of tonnage and poundage"**: tonnage and poundage generally granted by Parliament in the same act; having continued at 1 shilling/pound (5%), "a subsidy" came in customs language to denote a general duty of 5%

#### History of British Customs Duties (pp. 724-725)

- The **old subsidy** (Charles II's book of rates) is still levied — method of ascertaining value is said to be older than James I
- The **new subsidy** (9th & 10th William III) = additional 5% on the greater part of goods
- **One-third and two-third subsidies** between them = another 5% (proportionable parts)
- **Subsidy of 1747** = a fourth 5%; **subsidy of 1759** = a fifth 5% on some particular goods; plus a great variety of other occasional duties
- **Growing favour of exportation, discouragement of importation**: the old subsidy was indifferent (export and import alike); the four subsequent subsidies and most other duties have been laid **altogether upon importation**
  - Ancient export duties on home produce and manufactures have been either lightened or removed entirely; bounties given on exportation of some; drawbacks granted on re-exportation of foreign goods
  - **Exceptions**: materials of some home manufactures — merchants want these cheap and available; foreign raw materials sometimes imported duty-free (Spanish wool, flax, raw linen yarn); exportation of home-produced raw materials sometimes prohibited (English wool, beaver skins, gum-senega)

#### The Mercantile System and Customs Revenue (pp. 725-726)

- The mercantile system has used taxation as **"an instrument, not of revenue, but of monopoly"**
- High import duties have in many cases prohibited importation altogether, entirely prevented foreign wollens, very much diminished foreign silks and velvets — **"annihilated the revenue of customs which might have been levied upon such importation"**
- **Smuggling**: heavy duties encourage smuggling; **"Dr. Swift's arithmetic of the customs, two and two, instead of making four, make sometimes only one"** — moderate duties would yield more revenue
- **Bounties and drawbacks**: bounties on exportation of home produce and drawbacks on re-exportation of foreign goods have given occasion to many frauds and smuggling "more destructive of the public revenue than any other"
  - Goods are shipped for the bounty/drawback, then clandestinely re-landed in another part of the country
  - Gross produce of customs (year ending Jan 5, 1755): £5,068,000; bounties paid: £167,806; drawbacks: £2,156,800; bounties + drawbacks = £2,324,600; net customs after deductions: £2,743,400; after management expenses (£287,900): **neat customs revenue = £2,455,500**
  - Management expense = 5-6% of gross, but over 10% of net (after bounties and drawbacks)

#### Smith's Customs Reform Proposal (pp. 726-729)

- Not every article of expense need be taxed separately — revenue which excise raises on a few articles of most general consumption falls as equally on all contributors as customs on every article
- **Proposal**: confine customs duties to **a few articles only** of the most general use and consumption; extend the excise system to all imported goods (warehousing system)
  - The importer should be able to lodge goods in a **public warehouse** (under customs key), paying no duty until taken out for home consumption; if taken out for exportation, duty-free
  - If carried to private warehouse: duty paid immediately, warehouse subject to customs visits
  - **Excise-style administration for customs**: would much more effectively obstruct smuggling; current customs allow a merchant who has paid duties to be free from further visits; excise dealers have no respite from continual examination
- **Revenue impact**: the savings from abolishing all bounties on exportation + the drawback losses recovered, added to the simplification savings, would likely make the neat customs revenue **at least equal** to what it had ever been before
- **Trade benefits**: goods not taxed (the vast majority) would be perfectly free — free importation of necessaries would reduce the money price of labour without reducing real wages; home manufactures would gain advantage in all foreign markets; raw materials (silk from China, flax) imported duty-free would let English manufacturers undersell French and Italian rivals
- **Sir Robert Walpole's excise scheme** (wine and tobacco): intended as introduction to a more extensive system of the same kind — "Faction, combined with the interest of smuggling merchants, raised so violent... a clamour against that bill, that the minister thought proper to drop it; and, from a dread of exciting a clamour of the same kind, none of his successors have dared to resume the project"

#### Who Bears the Taxes on Consumable Commodities (pp. 729-731)

- **Duties on foreign luxuries** (wine, coffee, chocolate, tea, sugar): fall principally on people of middling or more than middling fortune
- **Duties on cheaper home-produced luxuries** (malt, hops, beer, ale): fall pretty equally on all ranks proportioned to expense — the poor pay on their own consumption; the rich pay on both their own and their servants'
- **"The whole consumption of the inferior ranks of people... is, in every country, much greater, not only in quantity, but in value"** — though individually small, collectively it amounts to the largest portion of national expense
  - The capital of every country = wages of productive labour distributed among the inferior ranks; profits of stock also partly go to small shopkeepers and retailers; some land rent goes to the same rank
- **"It must always be remembered... that it is the luxuries, and not the necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people, that ought ever to be taxed"** — taxing necessaries would fall on superior ranks and annual produce
- **Excise on home-brewed beer and ale**: the most productive branch of excise (gross produce year ending July 5, 1775: £3,341,837:9:9); falls "very much, perhaps principally" on common people
  - **Malt tax reform proposal**: replace all the different taxes on malt, beer, and ale with a single, trebled malt tax (from 6 to 18 shillings/quarter of malt)
  - Revenue estimate: current total from all malt/beer/ale duties averages ~£2,595,835:7:10; a trebled malt tax alone would produce ~£2,876,685:9:0 — exceeding the current revenue by £280,832:1:3
- **Private brewing exemption is unjust**: rich and middling families who brew at home are exempt from duty; their strong beer costs 8 shillings/barrel less than common people pay; such families drink 9-10 shillings/barrel cheaper than comparable ale-house quality
  - The exemption was meant to spare private families from "the odious visit and examination of the tax-gatherer" — but it makes the burden fall much lighter on the rich than on the poor
  - Under the malt tax, private brewers who malt their own grain would compound at 7 shillings 6 pence/head (= excise on 10 bushels of malt, a fair per-person average)

#### Malt Tax Details (pp. 732-735)

- **London porter brewery**: a quarter of malt yields 2-2.5 barrels; combined duties on malt, beer, and ale amount to 26-30 shillings/quarter
- **Country brewery**: a quarter yields barely 2 barrels of strong and 1 of small beer; combined duties = 23-26 shillings/quarter
- Taking the whole kingdom average, duties on malt, beer, and ale = no less than 24-25 shillings/quarter
- **By trebling the malt tax** (to 18 shillings) and removing all beer and ale duties: a single tax would yield more than all the current various taxes combined
- The **annual malt tax** also comprehends a tax of 4 shillings/hogshead on cyder and 10 shillings/barrel on mum; cyder tax (1774) produced only £3,083:6:8 (below normal — all cyder taxes that year produced less than ordinary); mum tax even less productive
- **Malt in the distillery**: used in manufacture of low wines and spirits; if malt tax raised to 18 shillings, "it might be necessary to make some abatement in the different excises which are imposed upon those particular sorts of low wines and spirits"
  - Malt = about a third of distillery materials (rest = barley or wheat); opportunity and temptation to smuggle greater in distillery than brewery
- **By increasing the duties upon malt and reducing those upon the distillery**, both smuggling opportunities and temptation would be diminished — a "still further augmentation of revenue"
- British policy has aimed to **discourage spirituous liquors** (health and morals) — the abatement on distillery duties should not be so great as to reduce spirit prices; but price of beer and ale might be considerably reduced, relieving the common people while augmenting revenue
- **Dr. Davenant's objections** (that the malt tax would concentrate profit on the maltster): Smith argues the maltster, advancing a lighter tax per quarter than the brewer currently advances per batch, would actually be better off; any inconvenience could be remedied by granting the maltster a few months' longer credit
- **"Nothing could reduce the rent and profit of barley land, which did not reduce the demand for barley"** — a system reducing combined duties from 24-25 to 18 shillings on a quarter of malt brewed into beer would not reduce that demand
  - The price of malt has constantly risen in proportion to taxes; those taxes have never lowered the rent of barley land; the final payment has fallen **constantly upon the consumer, and not upon the producer**
- **Monopoly-price produce** (wine, sugar): a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and profit — the price of precious vineyards is already the highest obtainable; it cannot be raised; so quantity and quality cannot be diminished; the whole weight falls on the vineyard rent
  - Sugar planters similarly complain that new sugar taxes fall on the producer — but the price was already a monopoly price before the tax; "the gains of monopolists, whenever they can be come at, being certainly of all subjects the most proper"

#### Tolls and Passage Duties (pp. 736-737)

- **French peages** (old Saxon peages = turnpike tolls or river tolls): originally local/provincial, for maintaining roads/bridges/canals; most properly imposed by **bulk or weight** of goods
  - When imposed by value (like inland customs/excise), they obstruct interior commerce
  - If turnpike tolls in Great Britain became a government revenue, "we may learn, by the example of many other nations, what would probably be the consequence" — the consumer pays not in proportion to value but to bulk/weight
- **Transit duties**: some small states (Italian states on the Po) levy duties on goods crossing their territory — paid entirely by foreigners; the only duties one state can impose on another without obstructing its own commerce
  - **The Sound toll** (king of Denmark on all merchant ships passing the Sound) = the most important transit duty in the world
- **Taxes on luxuries as customs and excise**: they fall indifferently on every species of revenue; paid by whoever consumes the commodities; **"every man's contribution is altogether voluntary"** — in his power to consume or not
  - They are agreeable to the first three maxims of taxation but **offend the fourth** (economy)
- **Absentee taxes**: where those who possess property in one country live in another, contributing nothing to the state's support — taxes on consumable commodities may be the only way to reach them (Ireland's situation with respect to Great Britain)

#### Four Ways Taxes on Consumable Commodities Offend the Fourth Maxim (pp. 738-741)

1. **Great number of revenue officers**: their salaries and perquisites are a real tax on the people bringing nothing to the treasury
   - But this expense is "more moderate in Great Britain than in most other countries" — excise gross produce (year ending July 5, 1775): £5,507,308:18:8¼, levied at expense of 5.5%; deducting bounties, drawbacks, and allowances → neat produce: £4,975,652:19:6
   - Customs are much more expensive (perquisites of custom-house officers "everywhere much greater than their salaries; at some ports more than double or triple")
   - **Confining customs to a few articles + levying all others as excise** might save over £50,000/year in customs administration
2. **Obstruction and discouragement to industry**: taxes always raise prices, discouraging consumption and production; taxes on home commodities divert labour into less advantageous channels; taxes on foreign commodities may encourage competing home industry but necessarily discourage almost every other
   - **"The dearer the Birmingham manufacturer buys his foreign wine, the cheaper he necessarily sells that part of his hardware with which... he buys it"** — his hardware becomes of less value to him and he has less encouragement to work at it
   - All taxes on consumable commodities **"tend to reduce the quantity of productive labour below what it otherwise would be"**
3. **Encouragement of smuggling**: forfeitures and penalties ruin the smuggler, whose capital is "absorbed either in the revenue of the state or in that of the revenue officer" — employed unproductively to the diminution of the general capital
   - **"A person who, though no doubt highly blameable for violating the laws of his country, is frequently incapable of violating those of natural justice"** — the laws create crimes that nature never meant; the smuggler, first imprudent then criminal, becomes "one of the hardiest and most determined violators of the laws of society"
   - **"Not many people are scrupulous about smuggling, when, without perjury, they can find an easy and safe opportunity of doing so"**
4. **Subjecting dealers to vexatious visits**: excise officers' frequent examinations expose dealers to "oppression, and always to much trouble and vexation" — though not strictly equivalent to expense, "certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it"
   - Excise laws are "more vexatious than those of the customs" — but excise officers are less corrupted than customs (more recent establishment, shorter history of authorized abuses)
   - These inconveniences "fall as light upon the people of Great Britain as upon those of any other country of which the government is nearly as expensive"

#### The Alcavala of Spain (pp. 741-742)

- Based on the notion that duties on consumable goods were taxes on merchants' profits — repeated upon every successive sale
- First 10%, then 14%, now 6% — on sale of every sort of property, moveable or immoveable, repeated every time the property is sold
- Requires a multitude of revenue officers guarding transportation from province to province, even shop to shop
- **Ustaritz** imputes to it the ruin of Spanish manufactures; "He might have imputed to it, likewise, the declension of agriculture"
- **Kingdom of Naples**: similar tax of 3% on all contracts/sales — but lighter; towns and parishes can pay a composition in lieu; Neapolitan tax is "not near so ruinous as the Spanish one"

#### Uniform vs. Non-Uniform Tax Systems (pp. 742-743)

- **Great Britain's uniform system**: with few exceptions, the same throughout the united kingdom; inland trade and coasting trade almost entirely free — no permit, let-pass, or examination by revenue officers (except coals carried coastwise needing certificates)
  - **"The effect of the uniformity of the system of taxation, is perhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of Great Britain"**
- **France's non-uniform system**: different revenue laws in different provinces; a multitude of revenue officers surround not only the kingdom's frontiers but those of almost each province
  - **Three groups of provinces**: (1) the five great farms (Picardy, Normandy, etc.) subject to tariff of 1664, the greater part of interior provinces; (2) provinces subject to tariff of 1667 ("reckoned foreign"), the frontier provinces; (3) provinces "said to be treated as foreign" (Alsace, three bishoprics of Metz/Toul/Verdun, Dunkirk, Bayonne, Marseilles) — free commerce with foreign countries but taxed as foreign when trading with other French provinces
  - Even within these divisions, many local duties that don't extend beyond a particular town or district
  - **Wine trade** (France's most important product after corn): subject to particular restraints favouring famous provinces' vineyards above others — "The provinces most famous for their wines... are those in which the trade in that article is subject to the fewest restraints of this kind"

#### Tax Farming vs. Government Administration (pp. 744-746)

- Taxes on consumable commodities may be levied by:
  1. **Government-appointed officers** (administration) — revenue varies year to year with consumption
  2. **Let in farm** for a fixed rent — the farmer collects with his own officers, obliged to levy in the manner directed by law
- **"The best and most frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm"** — over and above the stipulated rent, salaries, and expenses of administration, the farmer must always draw a profit proportioned to his advance, risk, trouble, and knowledge — a profit that is "always exorbitant"
- **Why tax farming is exorbitant**: farming requires great capital or great credit; few have the necessary knowledge/experience — this restrains competition; the few who can compete tend to **combine as copartners** rather than compete; when the farm is auctioned, they offer "no rent but what is much below the real value"
- **Tax farmers' cruelty**: "They have no bowels for the contributors" — universal bankruptcy after the farm expires would not affect their interest; in the greatest exigencies of state, they demand laws more severe than would otherwise exist
  - **"The most sanguinary are always to be found in countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm; the mildest, in countries where it is levied under the immediate inspection of the sovereign"**
- **France's tax farming system**: the greater part of actual revenue comes from eight sources — taille, capitation, two vingtièmes, gabelles, aides, traites, domaine, and farm of tobacco
  - The last five are farmed in the greater part of provinces; the first three levied by government administration — "it is universally acknowledged, that, in proportion to what they take out of the pockets of the people, they bring more into the treasury of the prince"
- **France's three needed reforms**:
  1. **Abolish the taille and capitation**, increase the vingtièmes to produce equal additional revenue — the superior ranks would not be more burdened; the taille's great inequalities would be eliminated
  2. **Make the gabelle, aides, traites, and excises uniform** throughout the kingdom (as in England) — levied at much less expense; interior commerce rendered as free as England's
  3. **Subject all taxes to government administration** rather than farming — the exorbitant profits of the farmers-general would be added to state revenue
  - **"The opposition arising from the private interest of individuals, is likely to be as effectual for preventing the two last as the first-mentioned scheme of reformation"**

#### France vs. Britain Comparison (pp. 746-748)

- **French system inferior in every respect**: Britain's £10 million annually levied on fewer than 8 million people without oppressing any particular order; France's people (23-24 million) "are much more oppressed by taxes than the people of Great Britain"
  - **"France, however, is certainly the great empire in Europe, which, after that of Great Britain, enjoys the mildest and most indulgent government"**
- **Holland**: heavy taxes on necessaries of life have "ruined, it is said, their principal manufacturers" and are "likely to discourage, gradually, even their fisheries and their trade in ship-building"
  - "The taxes upon the necessaries of life are inconsiderable in Great Britain, and no manufacture has hitherto been ruined by them"
  - British taxes hardest on manufactures are **duties on importation of raw materials**, especially raw silk
- **Revenue of the States-General and Dutch cities**: said to exceed £5,250,000 sterling — inhabitants cannot be supposed to exceed a third of Britain's; they must, in proportion, be much more heavily taxed
- **"After all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted, if the exigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes, they must be imposed upon improper ones"** — Holland's taxes on necessaries may be no impeachment of the republic's wisdom, given its expensive wars and need to maintain independence

#### Holland's Republican Government and Capital (pp. 748)

- The republican form supports Holland's present grandeur — great mercantile families have direct or indirect influence in administration
- For the sake of that respect and authority, they are willing to live where their capital brings less profit and interest — willing to accept less than they could earn elsewhere
- But any public calamity destroying the republican form would soon "annihilate altogether the importance of those wealthy merchants" — they would remove both their residence and capital to another country, and Holland's industry would follow

---

## CHAPTER III: Of Public Debts (pp. 749-763+)

### The Disposition to Save vs. Spend in Different Ages of Society

- In the rude state before commerce, a person with large revenue can spend it only by maintaining people — "a hospitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there is no ostentation"
  - Feudal ancestors were frugal by necessity — estates stayed in families for generations; trade was disgraceful; lending at interest was prohibited as usury; hoarding was the only option
  - **Treasure-trove** (found hoard with no known owner) was an important branch of sovereign revenue — showing how common hoarding was
- In a **commercial country**: the sovereign, like any great lord, spends revenue on luxuries, finery, pageantry — dismisses retainers, makes tenants independent
  - **"The same frivolous passions, which influence their conduct, influence his"** — he becomes the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to such pleasures; he spends so much as to debilitate the defensive power of the state
- **Modern government expenditure**: ordinary expense in peacetime is equal or nearly equal to ordinary revenue; in war, expense becomes 3-4x the peace revenue
  - Taxes from which the additional wartime revenue must be drawn will not begin coming into the treasury for 10-12 months after imposition
  - **"In this exigency, government can have no other resource but in borrowing"**

### Why Commercial States Borrow

- The same commercial state that creates the **necessity** of borrowing also creates in the subjects both the **ability and inclination to lend**
  - Merchants and manufacturers abound with capital that passes through their hands frequently; they can advance large sums at all times
  - **"The merchant or monied man makes money by lending to government, and instead of diminishing, increases his trading capital"** — he considers it a favour when admitted to subscribe to a new loan
  - The security granted to the original creditor, being transferable, generally sells for more than originally paid — the government borrows on "terms extremely advantageous to the lender"
- **"The government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this ability and willingness of its subjects to lend their money on extraordinary occasions. It foresees the facility of borrowing, and therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving"**
- In a **rude state**: no mercantile/manufacturing capitals; individuals who hoard distrust government (fear of plunder); the sovereign **must save** because he foresees the impossibility of borrowing

### The Progress of Public Debt

- Nations have generally begun to borrow on **personal credit** (no assigned fund for repayment); when that fails, they assign/mortgage particular branches of revenue
- **Two methods**: (1) assign for a **short period** (anticipation) — fund is supposed sufficient to pay both principal and interest within the time; (2) assign for **perpetuity** (funding) — government pays interest only, or a perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest
- **Anticipation** → **perpetual funding**: the produce of temporary taxes, insufficient to pay both principal and interest, necessitated prolonging the term; this led to charging interest only (perpetual annuity); "such improvident anticipations necessarily gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding"
  - **"This practice necessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period, to one so indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive"**
  - But perpetual funding can raise more than anticipation in most cases — once familiar with it, men prefer it; **"To relieve the present exigency, is always the object which principally interests those immediately concerned in the administration of public affairs. The future liberation of the public revenue they leave to the care of posterity"**

### History of British Public Debt (pp. 754-763)

- **1697 (Treaty of Ryswick)**: foundation of the present enormous debt laid; first general mortgage or fund established
  - 1st general mortgage (1697): deficiencies amounted to £5,160,459:14:9½
  - 2nd general mortgage (1701): prolonged to 1710; deficiencies £2,055,999:7:11½
  - 3rd general mortgage (1707): prolonged to 1712; borrowed £983,254:11:9¼
  - 4th general mortgage (1708): prolonged to 1714; borrowed £925,176:9:2¼
  - 5th general mortgage (1709): £922,029:6s
  - 6th general mortgage (1710): prolonged to 1720
- **South Sea Company (1711)**: different anticipations continued forever and made a fund for paying interest on the company's capital of £9,177,967:15:4d — "the greatest loan which at that time had ever been made"
- **1715 (George I, c. 12)**: different mortgaged taxes rendered perpetual, accumulated into the **aggregate fund**
- **1717**: more perpetual taxes accumulated into the **general fund** (£724,849:6:10½)
- **The sinking fund**: from reductions in interest rates (from 6% to 5% to 4% to 3-3.5%), a considerable surplus accumulated in the produce of the three great funds — this became the sinking fund
  - But the sinking fund has been "almost always applied to other purposes" — misapplied to defray extraordinary peacetime expenses
  - **"The more the public debts may have been accumulated, the more necessary it may have become to study to reduce them; the more dangerous, the more ruinous it may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund; the more likely, the more certainly, is the sinking fund to be misapplied"**

### The Debt Through Successive Wars

- **War of 1702-1713 (Treaty of Utrecht)**: debt by Dec 31, 1714 = £53,681,076:5:6½; South-sea subscription and long/short annuities increased it to £55,282,978:1:3 5/6 (Dec 31, 1722)
  - 17 years of profound peace (1723-1739) reduced total paid off to only £8,328,354:17:11 3/12 — remaining debt £46,954,623:3:4 7/12
- **War of Spanish Succession + French War (1739-1748, Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle)**: debt by Dec 31, 1748 = £78,293,313:1:10¾
  - 17 years of peace took no more than £8,328,354:17:11¼ from it; a war of less than 9 years added £31,338,689:18:6 1/6
- **Mr. Pelham's administration**: interest reduced from 4% to 3%; sinking fund increased; some debt paid off
  - Before the Seven Years' War, funded debt on Jan 5, 1763 = £72,289,675
  - At conclusion of peace: funded debt = £122,603,336:8:2¼; unfunded = £13,927,589:2:2
  - War did not end with peace — by Jan 5, 1764, funded debt increased to £129,586,789:10:1¾ (partly by new loan, partly by funding part of unfunded)
- **Jan 5, 1775**: funded debt = £124,996,086:1:6¼d; unfunded (excluding civil-list debt) = £4,150,236:3:11 7/8; **total = £129,146,322:5:6**
  - During 11 years of profound peace, only £10,415,476:16:9 7/8 paid off — and even this small reduction was not all from savings; extraneous sums contributed (shilling/pound land tax for 3 years, £2 million from East India Company for territorial acquisitions, £110,000 from bank for charter renewal)

### Methods of Borrowing: Annuities for Terms of Years and for Lives (pp. 757-760)

- **Annuities for terms of years**: William III and Anne frequently borrowed this way — 1695: £1 million borrowed at 14% (£140,000/year for 16 years); in 1691, another £1 million for life annuities (subscription not filled, deficiency made good at 14% for lives = ~7 years purchase)
  - In 1695, annuity purchasers were allowed to exchange for 96-year annuities at 63¾ years purchase (i.e. 14% for life converted to 14% for 96 years)
  - By 1719-1720, annuities of 32, 89, and 99 years were converted into South-sea stock
- **Annuities for lives**: value depends on expected lifetime — intrinsically worth nearly the same as a perpetual annuity, but does not attract the same purchasers (families making settlements prefer perpetual stock whose value is constant)
  - An annuity for a long term of years (98-99) is very nearly a perpetuity and should find nearly the same purchasers
- **Tontines**: annuities granted on lots of 20-30 lives; survivors succeed to the annuities of those who die before them; last survivor receives the whole lot's annuity
  - **"Upon the same revenue, more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities for separate lives"** — the right of survivorship makes each annuity worth more than its actuarial value (lottery principle: everyone overestimates their own longevity)
- **France**: much greater proportion of public debt consists in annuities for lives — because French merchants (not being in the seat of government) prefer to advance money for annuities on their own lives rather than for a transferable perpetuity
  - Rich bachelors of great fortune and great pride, "too proud to marry their equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them" — having no care for posterity, they exchange capital for a revenue lasting "just as long, and no longer, than they wish it to do"
  - Such people = "much greater in France than in England"

### Government Borrowing in Wartime (pp. 760-761)

- In peacetime, governments are unwilling and unable to increase revenue in proportion to war expenses — unwilling for fear of offending; unable from not knowing what taxes would suffice
- **"The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment"** — by means of borrowing, a very moderate increase of taxes, from year to year, suffices to carry on the war; by perpetual funding, the smallest possible increase raises the largest possible sum
- People in the capital and provinces remote from the scene of action "scarce feel any inconveniency from the war" — they enjoy reading about their fleets and armies in the newspapers; this amusement compensates the small tax difference between war and peace
- **"They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory"**
- Return of peace rarely relieves them of war taxes — these are mortgaged for interest on the debt
- **Sinking fund misapplication**: if war taxes, over and above paying interest and ordinary government expenses, produce surplus → sinking fund for paying off debt
  - But the sinking fund is "generally altogether inadequate" for paying the whole war debt during any reasonable period of peace
  - In the second place, it is "almost always applied to other purposes" — misapplied to defray extraordinary peacetime expenses
  - A momentary suspension of debt payment causes neither murmur nor complaint; "To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious and easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty"

### British Debt: The Numbers (pp. 762-763)

- **Treaty of Ryswick (1697)**: debt = £21,515,742:13:8½
- After peace → War of Utrecht → Dec 31, 1714: £53,681,076:5:6½
- South-sea subscription → Dec 31, 1722: £55,282,978:1:3 5/6
- 17 years peace → Dec 31, 1739: debt reduced by £8,328,354 only → £46,954,623
- War → Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle → Dec 31, 1748: £78,293,313:1:10¾
- 17 years peace → no more than £8,328,354 taken off
- Seven Years' War → Jan 5, 1764: funded + unfunded ≈ £139,561,807
- 11 years peace → Jan 5, 1775: £129,146,322:5:6 — only £10,415,476 reduced, and not all from state savings
  - Extraneous contributions: extra land tax shilling (3 years), £2 million from East India Company, £110,000 from Bank of England for charter renewal
- **Seven Years' War annuities for lives** (granted as premiums to subscribers in 1757): valued at 14 years purchase = £472,500
- Long-term annuities (1761-1762) granted as premiums: valued at 27.5 years purchase = £6,826,875
- **During ~7 years of peace**, Mr. Pelham's administration could only pay off £6 million of old debt; during nearly the same duration of war, a new debt of more than £75 million was contracted

### The Impossibility of Repaying Public Debt (pp. 764-766)

- Total debt including Earl of Chatham's balance, Mr. Calcraft's accounts, army savings, Bank receipts, East India Company funds, and the additional shilling in the pound land tax = "a good deal more than five millions" beyond £1,455,949:18:9
- Since the peace, not one year with another, has savings from ordinary revenue amounted to half a million a-year
- Sinking fund augmented by reduction of redeemable 4% to 3%, and by annuities for lives falling in — if peace continued, perhaps a million/year could be spared
- But a large civil-list debt was left unpaid, and "we are now involved in a new war" (American Revolution) — may prove as expensive as any former wars
- **"It would be altogether chimerical, therefore, to expect that the public debt should ever be completely discharged, by any savings which are likely to be made from that ordinary revenue as it stands at present"**
- One author (probably Pinto) represented public debt as "the accumulation of a great capital, superadded to the other capital of the country" — Smith demolishes this view
- The capital lent to government was **turned away from maintaining productive labourers** to maintaining unproductive ones, "and wasted, generally in the course of the year, without even the hope of any future reproduction"
- Creditors received annuities of more than equal value — enabling them to borrow or sell the annuity to get new capital — but this new capital **must have already existed** in the country; it was merely redirected, not created
- **"Though it replaced to them what they had advanced to government, it did not replace it to the country"**

### Funding vs. Taxation for War Expenses (pp. 765-766)

- When war is defrayed by funding, it destroys existing capital; when by taxation within the year, it merely redirects revenue from private unproductive to public unproductive spending
- Taxation within the year "does not necessarily occasion the destruction of any actually-existing capital"
- Under the system of funding, frugality of private people can more easily repair government waste — **"but it is only during the continuance of war"** that funding has this advantage
- Without funding: wars would be felt immediately, end sooner, be undertaken less wantonly — **"The people feeling, during continuance of war, the complete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it"**
- Funding creates the illusion of painless war: people remote from fighting "scarce feel any inconveniency" — enjoy reading about battles in newspapers — **"They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory"**
- When funding has progressed far enough, the multiplication of taxes impairs accumulation "as much as the ability of private people to accumulate would in time of war" without funding
- Britain's peace revenue = more than 10 million a-year; if free and unmortgaged, it could fund the most vigorous war "without contracting a shilling of new debt"
- **The pernicious system of funding** has made the ability to accumulate as impaired in peace as it would be in the most expensive war

### Bankruptcy: The Inevitable Resolution of National Debt (pp. 769-772)

- **"When national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid"**
- Liberation of public revenue has **always been brought about by bankruptcy** — sometimes avowed, often disguised as "pretended payment"
- **Raising the denomination of the coin**: the most usual expedient for disguised bankruptcy — e.g., if sixpence raised to denomination of a shilling, a borrower of 20 shillings repays with only half the silver
- **"A national debt of about a hundred and twenty-eight millions... might in this manner be paid with about sixty-four millions of our present money"** — but creditors really defrauded of 10 shillings per pound
- **Roman examples**: At end of first Punic war, Romans reduced the As from 12 ounces to 2 ounces of copper, then to 1 ounce, then ½ ounce — paying debts with 1/24 of original value; combining all three operations, £128 million could be reduced to £5,333,333:6:8
- **"So sudden and so great a bankruptcy, we should in the present times be apt to imagine, must have occasioned a very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have occasioned any."**
- Roman debtors in the Republic were constantly in debt to the rich; senators consented to debt-abolition laws partly to liberate public revenue and restore vigour to government "of which they themselves had the principal direction"
- An operation reducing £128 million to £21,333,333:6:8 at once
- **Adulteration of the standard**: mixing more alloy into coins — a concealed operation; "Both operations are unjust. But a simple augmentation is an injustice of open violence; whereas an adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud"
- After augmentation, coin is "very seldom brought back to its former weight"; after adulteration, "almost always brought back to its former fineness"
- King John of France adulterated his coin and swore all mint officers to secrecy
- Henry VIII and Edward VI both raised denomination AND adulterated — "The like frauds were practised in Scotland during the minority of James VI"

### Can Britain's Debt Ever Be Repaid? (pp. 772-773)

- **"That the public revenue of Great Britain can never be completely liberated"** seems clear — surplus over peace expenses is too small
- Liberation requires either **considerable augmentation of public revenue** or **considerable reduction of public expense**
- A more equal land tax, tax on house rents, and alterations to customs and excise could augment revenue — but even "the most sanguine projector" could not expect this alone to suffice

### Smith's Grand Proposal: Extending British Taxation to All Provinces (pp. 773-783)

- **"By extending the British system of taxation to all the different provinces of the empire"** — inhabited by people of British or European extraction — much greater revenue might be expected
- This could scarcely be done without admitting colonial representatives into the British Parliament — "a fair and equal representation of all those different provinces, that of each province bearing the same proportion to the produce of its taxes"
- **The private interest of many powerful individuals and the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people** oppose this
- Such a speculation "can, at worst, be regarded but as a new Utopia"

#### The Four Branches of British Taxation Applied to Ireland, America, and the Colonies

- **Land tax**: Ireland and American/West Indian plantations more able to pay land tax than Great Britain; America pays no tythe, could afford it; lands not yet on rent rolls could be assessed by equitable valuation (as in the Milanese, Austria, Prussia, Sardinia)
- **Stamp duties**: could be levied without variation everywhere the legal forms are the same
- **Customs**: extending customs uniformly to Ireland and plantations — would create a vast internal free-trade zone; "The British empire would thus afford, within itself, an immense internal market for every part of the produce of all its different provinces"
- **Excise**: the only branch requiring variation by province; could be applied to Ireland without change; in America, modifications needed (e.g., molasses beer brewed privately, not suitable for ale-house-style excise regulation)
- **Sugar, rum, and tobacco** = "commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life" but "objects of almost universal consumption" — extremely proper subjects of taxation; if colonial union occurred, could be taxed before leaving manufacturer/grower, or deposited in public warehouses

#### Revenue Projections from the Union

- Britain levies 10+ million on 8 million people; Ireland has 2+ million; twelve American colonies contain 3+ million (accounts possibly exaggerated)
- Suppose 13 million inhabitants total → system should raise 16+ million (£250,000 sterling)
- Deduct revenue for Ireland and plantations civil government → ~15 million two hundred fifty thousand remaining for general empire expense and debt payment
- If even 1 million/year spared for debt reduction, the sinking fund could discharge the whole debt in a few years, "and thus restore completely the at-present debilitated and languishing vigour of the empire"

#### Revenue Growth and Consumption Patterns Across the Empire (pp. 777-779)

- Revenue would not immediately increase proportionally — new provinces need time to adjust to burdens
- In poor/thinly inhabited countries, smuggling opportunities are great; consumption of taxed commodities is small
- Scotland: excise on malt/beer/ale produces less than England proportionally — different quality and more smuggling
- Ireland: inferior ranks poorer than Scotland; thinly inhabited; consumption proportionally less
- America/West Indies: white people (even lowest rank) in much better circumstances than English counterparts; consumption of luxuries "probably much greater"
- **The blacks** "who make the greater part of the inhabitants, both of the southern colonies upon the continent and of the West India islands, as they are in a state of slavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people either in Scotland or Ireland"
- For enslaved people: it is their master's interest they be "fed well, and kept in good heart" for work — their allowance of rum, molasses, or spruce-beer would not be withdrawn; "though those articles should be subjected to moderate duties"
- With two simple changes (single malt duty + excise-law customs), smuggling in excise largely eliminated; customs/excise could produce revenue proportional to population even in thinly inhabited provinces

#### Paper Money in the American Colonies (pp. 778-782)

- Americans lack gold/silver money — domestic commerce uses paper currency — this is "the effect of choice, and not of necessity"
- Scarcity of metals = colonists prefer investing in "active and productive stock" over "dead stock" (gold/silver)
- Colony governments find it in their interest to supply paper money; some (Pennsylvania) lend it at interest for revenue; others (Massachusetts Bay) issue it for public emergencies, later redeem at depreciated value
- In tobacco colonies (Virginia, Maryland): British goods advanced on credit, paid in tobacco — gold and silver rarely appear in their commerce
- Northern colonies (Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, New England): exports to Britain less than imports — balance paid via trade with other colonies (carriers), and ultimately in gold/silver to Britain
- Sugar colonies: produce value exported to Britain far exceeds imports — large balance paid in gold/silver; irregular payments from Jamaica (uncultivated land tempts speculation)
- American revenue could be remitted in bills drawn on British merchants rather than gold/silver — unnecessary to export specie

#### The East India Company and Other Revenue Sources (pp. 784)

- Territorial acquisitions of East India Company = "undoubted right of the Crown" — could render another revenue source, perhaps more abundant than all those mentioned
- Those countries are more fertile, extensive, and populous than Great Britain
- No need to introduce new taxation into countries already sufficiently taxed — "It might, perhaps, be more proper to lighten than to aggravate the burden of those unfortunate countries"
- Revenue improvement should come from preventing embezzlement and misapplication of existing taxes

#### The Colonial Empire: Smith's Final Verdict (pp. 784-785)

- Peace-establishment expense of colonies was very considerable even before the present disturbances
- Last war (Seven Years' War) cost Britain upwards of 90 million on account of colonies; Spanish War of 1739 cost upwards of 40 million, "a great part of which ought justly to be charged to the colonies"
- **In those two wars alone, the colonies cost Great Britain much more than double the sum which the national debt amounted to before the commencement of the first of them**
- Had it not been for those wars, the old debt "might, and probably would by this time, have been completely paid"
- **"The rulers of Great Britain have, for more than a century past, amused the people with the imagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only."**
- **"It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expense, without being likely to bring any profit"**
- The monopoly of the colony trade = "to the great body of the people, mere loss instead of profit"
- **"It is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this golden dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as well as the people; or that they should awake from it themselves, and endeavour to awaken the people"**
- If the project cannot be completed, it ought to be given up — Britain should free herself from the expense of defending provinces that will not contribute to the empire
- **"It is surely time that Great Britain should free herself from the expense of defending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of their civil or military establishment in time of peace, and endeavour to accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances."**
