# The Wealth of Nations — Summary
## By Adam Smith | 1776

### About the Author
Adam Smith (1723–1790) was a Scottish moral philosopher and political economist. A professor at the University of Glasgow, he published *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759) before spending a decade writing *The Wealth of Nations*, widely regarded as the founding text of modern economics. Smith drew on his travels in France (where he met the Physiocrats), his Scottish Enlightenment milieu (David Hume was a close friend), and exhaustive historical research to produce a systematic account of how nations become prosperous.

### About the Book
Published in 1776 — the same year as American independence — *The Wealth of Nations* is divided into five Books spanning approximately 785 pages. It moves from microeconomic foundations (division of labour, prices, wages) through capital accumulation and economic history, to a devastating critique of mercantilism, and concludes with a theory of public finance. The book is simultaneously a work of economic theory, a polemic against commercial monopoly, and a moral argument for the liberty of ordinary people.

## Key Takeaways

1. **National wealth is measured by annual production, not gold reserves.** The central error of mercantilism — equating money with wealth — leads to ruinous policy. Real wealth is the total annual produce of a nation's land and labour.

2. **The division of labour is the primary engine of productivity.** Smith's pin factory example (1 worker = 1 pin/day; 10 specialized workers = 48,000 pins/day) demonstrates that specialization multiplies output by orders of magnitude through increased dexterity, time savings, and machine invention.

3. **Self-interest, channelled through markets, serves the public good.** "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." Individuals pursuing private gain are "led by an invisible hand" to promote ends they never intended.

4. **Prices gravitate toward a "natural price" determined by wages, rent, and profit.** Market price fluctuates with supply and demand, but competition constantly pushes it toward the natural price — a proto-equilibrium concept.

5. **Wages are highest in growing economies, not the richest ones.** North America paid higher wages than wealthier England because its demand for labour was increasing fastest. Stagnant economies (China) push wages to bare subsistence; declining economies (Bengal) push them below it.

6. **High wages are a feature, not a bug.** "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable." Well-fed workers are more productive, not less.

7. **Profits and wages are inversely related.** As capital accumulates and competition among employers increases, profits naturally fall and wages rise — the normal trajectory of an improving economy.

8. **Monopoly is the great enemy of prosperity.** Whether corporate charters, guild restrictions, apprenticeship laws, or colonial trade monopolies — every exclusive privilege raises prices, misallocates capital, and enriches the few at the expense of the many.

9. **Free trade benefits both parties.** Trade forced by bounties and monopolies may be disadvantageous, but "that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places, is always advantageous to both." The maxim of every prudent family — never make at home what costs more to make than to buy — applies equally to nations.

10. **The mercantile system sacrifices the consumer to the producer.** "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer." The entire mercantile system inverts this logic.

11. **The natural order of investment is agriculture → manufactures → commerce, but Europe reversed it.** Commerce and luxury goods lured feudal lords into dismissing their retainers, which inadvertently established order, good government, and secure property rights — the preconditions for agricultural improvement.

12. **Capital accumulation drives economic growth, and parsimony (saving) is its engine.** "Every prodigal appears to be a public enemy, and every frugal man a public benefactor." The "uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition" is powerful enough to overcome the worst government policy.

13. **Paper money and banking are powerful but dangerous tools.** Substituting paper for gold frees up metal for productive use (like replacing a highway through productive land with a "waggon-way through the air"), but over-issuance by reckless banks leads to collapse.

14. **Government has exactly three duties**: defending society from external violence, protecting every member from injustice, and maintaining certain public works and institutions that private enterprise cannot profitably provide (roads, canals, education, basic justice).

15. **Public education is essential to counteract the stupefying effects of the division of labour.** The worker confined to "a few very simple operations" becomes "as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become." Parish schools, geometry, and mechanics should be universally taught.

16. **Endowed institutions become corrupt through lack of accountability.** At Oxford, professors have "given up altogether even the pretence of teaching." Where teachers depend on fees and reputation, quality thrives; where salaries are guaranteed regardless of performance, indolence prevails.

17. **Taxation should follow four maxims: equality, certainty, convenience, and economy.** An uncertain tax is worse than an unequal one. Taxes should take as little as possible beyond what they deliver to the treasury.

18. **Taxes on necessaries of life operate as indirect taxes on wages**, raising costs for employers and landlords. The middling and superior ranks should oppose them in their own self-interest.

19. **National debt, once accumulated beyond a certain point, is never honestly repaid.** "There is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid." Governments invariably resort to disguised bankruptcy through coin debasement or inflation.

20. **The British Empire is an expensive delusion.** "This empire has hitherto existed in imagination only. It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine" — a project of "immense expense, without being likely to bring any profit."

21. **Commerce should be a bond of friendship among nations, not a source of war.** Mercantile jealousy makes neighbours into enemies when their prosperity should be welcomed — rich neighbours are better customers.

22. **The interests of merchants and manufacturers diverge from the public interest.** "The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution... It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public."

23. **Standing armies, not militias, are necessary for modern defence — and are compatible with liberty.** After firearms, regularity and discipline matter more than individual skill. A standing army under a constitutional sovereign can even be favourable to liberty by making repressive surveillance unnecessary.

24. **Religious establishments are best managed when clergy are paid modestly and diverse sects coexist.** Hundreds of small sects competing for adherents would "in time, probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational religion, free from every mixture of absurdity, imposture, or fanaticism."

25. **Property creates the need for government.** "Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality... It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property can sleep a single night in security." Government is "instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor."

## Thematic Breakdowns

### The Nature of Wealth and Value
Smith demolishes the mercantilist equation of wealth with gold. Wealth is the annual produce of land and labour — the goods and services a nation creates, not the metal it hoards. Labour is "the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for all things." The diamond-water paradox (water is essential but cheap; diamonds are useless but expensive) reveals the distinction between value in use and value in exchange.

### The Mechanics of Markets
Prices are composed of three elements: wages, rent, and profit. The "natural price" is the equilibrium around which market prices gravitate. When market price exceeds natural price, profits attract new entrants, increasing supply and driving price down. Smith's price theory is essentially a gravitational model — constant fluctuation around a stable centre, maintained by the force of competition.

### Labour and Class
Smith is remarkably sympathetic to workers. Masters hold structural advantages (fewer in number, legally permitted to combine, able to hold out longer), while workers' combinations are illegal. The law, "when it has attempted to regulate wages, has always been rather to lower them than to raise them." Smith identifies three orders of society: landlords (whose interest aligns with the public but who are too indolent to understand it), labourers (whose interest aligns with the public but who lack education and time to articulate it), and merchants/manufacturers (whose interest diverges from the public and who actively deceive it).

### Capital and Growth
Capital accumulation precedes and enables the division of labour. Fixed capital (machines, buildings, skills) and circulating capital (money, materials, goods) work together. Saving (parsimony) is the engine of growth — what is saved from revenue is added to capital, employing additional productive hands. The "uniform, constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition" is more powerful than any government policy, capable of overcoming "the greatest errors of administration."

### Trade and Empire
Smith's critique of mercantilism is devastating: export bounties impose double taxes on the people; import restrictions misallocate capital; colonial monopolies enrich a few merchants while impoverishing the nation. The British Empire's colonial monopoly cost more in wars and administration than it ever returned in profit. Smith's radical proposal — voluntarily give up the colonies or grant them parliamentary representation — was ignored, and the American Revolution vindicated his analysis.

### Government and Public Finance
The sovereign's three duties are defence, justice, and public works. Smith's four maxims of taxation (equality, certainty, convenience, economy) remain foundational principles. He analyzes every major tax instrument — land taxes, profit taxes, wage taxes, consumption taxes, stamp duties — with forensic precision, always tracing who ultimately bears the burden. His conclusion: taxes on luxuries are relatively harmless; taxes on necessaries cascade through the economy, raising costs for everyone.

## Contrarian Ideas

1. **Talent differences between people are mostly environmental, not innate.** "The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education." Human nature is more uniform than it appears.

2. **Slavery is the most expensive form of labour.** "The work done by slaves, though it appears to cost only their maintenance, is in the end the dearest of any." Without incentive, slaves produce the minimum possible.

3. **Great proprietors are terrible at improving land.** The landowner born to wealth attends to ornament, not profit. Small proprietors with everything at stake are the best improvers.

4. **The discovery of America brought "dreadful misfortunes" to natives.** Smith is clear-eyed about colonialism: "folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over and directed the first project of establishing those colonies."

5. **Commerce destroyed feudalism by appealing to vanity.** Lords traded "the maintenance of 1000 men for a year for a pair of diamond buckles" — "For the gratification of the most childish, the meanest, and the most sordid of all vanities, they gradually bartered their whole power and authority."

6. **Wine countries are sober; beer countries are drunk.** Cheapness of wine in southern Europe discourages excess; dearness of alcohol in northern Europe turns drinking into a vice of distinction.

7. **The division of labour makes workers stupid.** Smith, the great champion of specialization, acknowledges its human cost: the worker confined to repetitive tasks "naturally loses the habit of exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become."

8. **Science is "the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition."** Smith advocates state-supported scientific education to combat religious fanaticism.

9. **Fear of engrossing and forestalling (hoarding) is compared to belief in witchcraft.** Popular panic about food merchants profiteering is as irrational as witch-hunting; free corn trade is the best preventive of famine.

10. **National debt is never honestly repaid.** Every historical example of debt resolution involves some form of bankruptcy — usually disguised as coin debasement. The Romans reduced their debt by 96% through successive currency devaluations.

11. **Joint-stock companies are inherently wasteful.** Directors "manage other people's money, not their own" and are "apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour." Only four businesses are suited to the joint-stock form: banking, insurance, canals, and water supply.

12. **"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public."** Even social gatherings of businessmen tend toward cartel behaviour.

## Author's Key Proposals

1. **Abolish all monopolies, bounties, and trade restrictions** — restore "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty"
2. **Open colonial trade to all nations** — or grant colonies parliamentary representation with proportional taxation
3. **Sell all crown lands** to private improvers — the state is a terrible landlord
4. **Establish universal parish schools** teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, and mechanics
5. **Ban bank notes under £5** to prevent small-bank failures that ruin the poor
6. **Reform taxation** according to four maxims: equality, certainty, convenience, economy
7. **Tax ground-rents specifically** — they owe their existence to good government and should fund it
8. **Abolish apprenticeship and settlement laws** that restrict labour mobility
9. **Gradually restore free trade** — "only by slow gradations, and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection"
10. **Separate judicial from executive power** and make judges independent
11. **Allow hundreds of small religious sects** rather than establishing one church — competition produces moderation
12. **Fund public works through user fees** (tolls, port-duties) rather than general taxation
