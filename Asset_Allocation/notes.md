## Foreword by Sir John M. Templeton (April 1989)

Drawing on 49 years of professional investing, Templeton distills his core principles:

**Value Investing as Foundation.** Successful investing is mainly common sense -- searching for the best asset value for each dollar you pay. If you buy a share for a small fraction of its intrinsic value, there is less risk of a major price decline and more opportunity for a major price increase.

**Diversification.** Do not put all your assets in any one type of investment, one company, one industry, or one nation. By searching across all nations, you find more bargains, and you reduce risk because bear markets and recessions occur at different times in different countries. Changing economic conditions affect various types of investment assets differently; by diversifying among them, the value of your portfolio will not fluctuate as much.

**Thrift.** An investor seeking to build wealth must adhere to a budget that includes a large amount of savings. During Templeton's first 15 years after college, he saved 50 cents out of every dollar earned. "Those who are thrifty will grow wealthy, and those who are spendthrifts will become poor."

**Dollar-Cost Averaging.** Invest the same amount at regular intervals in a fluctuating investment. Your average cost will be below the average price, because your dollars buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high.

**Be a Lender, Not a Borrower.** John D. Rockefeller said to grow wealthy you must have your money work for you. If you never borrow, interest will always work for you, and you will have peace of mind through bear markets and recessions that occur in most nations about twice every ten years.

**Prepare for Bear Markets -- Financially and Psychologically.** Experts do not know when each bear market will begin, but you can be certain there will be many during your lifetime. Financially, never be forced to sell at the wrong time; have additional funds to buy when prices are unreasonably low. Psychologically, expect the cycles so you do not act on emotion rather than facts.

**Contrarian Investing.** Templeton's founding principle:

> "To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest reward."

If you go to 10 doctors who all agree on the proper medicine, you should take that medicine. But if 10 security analysts all agree you should buy a particular share, you must do the opposite -- because if 100% are buying and even one changes his mind, you have already passed the peak. Common sense is not common, but careful logic shows it is impossible to produce superior performance if you buy the same assets at the same time as others.

**Judging Investments.** A share is nothing more than a right to receive a share of future earnings. For the part-time investor, three simple questions reveal management quality: (1) Is the company growing more rapidly than competitors? (2) Is the profit margin wider? (3) Are annual earnings on invested assets larger?

**Long Time Horizons.** Asset price fluctuations may be even greater and more frequent in the future because all human activity is accelerating. Judge investment advisors over at least one full market cycle, preferably several. An advisor who takes the most risk will have top performance in a bull market and the opposite in a bear market.

**The Power of Starting Early.** If you begin at age 25 to invest $2,000 annually in an IRA compounding tax-free at 10% annually, you will have nearly a million dollars at age 65.

## Chapter 1: The Importance of Asset Allocation

### Ancient Roots, Modern Practice

The Talmud (circa 1200 B.C.--500 A.D.) counseled dividing money into thirds: land, business, and reserve. Asset allocation is not new -- it is approximately 2,000 years old.

### How Markets Became Efficient

Historically, full-time professionals competed mostly against amateur investors and could "beat the market" through stock selection. Today, **institutional trading accounts for more than 80% of exchange activity**. On the New York Stock Exchange, millions of transactions occur between willing buyers and sellers -- both typically institutions with nearly instantaneous access to publicly available information, staffed by well-trained analysts who have carefully evaluated the same data and reached opposite conclusions. At the moment of trade, both parties act from informed conviction, though time will prove one right and the other wrong. The free-market price is a consensus of a security's intrinsic value.

The irony: the same high-powered talent that creates marketplace efficiency also makes achievement of above-average returns exceedingly difficult. Research repeatedly shows that most money managers underperform the market on average over time, and those who outperform in one period do not have better than even odds of outperforming in the next.

The growth of **index funds** is tangible evidence of this efficiency. In an efficient market, active management with its transaction costs is expected to underperform on average over time. Not all sectors may be equally efficient -- small company stocks command less institutional research than large stocks, and various international markets may be less efficient than the U.S. market -- but increasing efficiency will continue to narrow possible rewards from superior skill.

### Markowitz and the Birth of Modern Portfolio Theory

**Harry M. Markowitz** published "Portfolio Selection" in the *Journal of Finance* in 1952, developing the first mathematical model showing how combining investments with different return patterns reduces portfolio volatility -- amazingly, nearly a half century before the advent of modern computers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990.

Before Markowitz, investment management was **two-dimensional**: focusing on the volatility and return of individual securities. Modern portfolio theory added a **third dimension** -- the **diversification effect** -- evaluating a security's impact on the overall portfolio. Optimal diversification goes beyond spreading eggs across baskets; the baskets must be **distinctly different from one another**, so each basket's unique return pattern partially offsets the others, smoothing overall portfolio volatility.

**ERISA (1974)** and the **prudent investor rule** codified this portfolio-level thinking into law, stressing the importance of diversification within a broad portfolio context and focusing on the trust's portfolio as a whole rather than viewing specific investments in isolation.

### The Three-Step Portfolio Design Process

1. **Decide which asset classes** will be represented (default: include all major classes unless sound reasons exist for exclusion)
2. **Set long-term target percentages** for each asset class, based on the investor's objectives, time horizon, and volatility tolerance
3. **Specify tactical ranges** (minimum/maximum) for each asset class to allow for adjustments -- the "market timing" dimension, whose obvious danger lies in being in the wrong place at the wrong time with 100% of one's capital

Security selection (step 4) can be done either passively via index funds or actively, predicated on the belief that exploitable inefficiencies exist at the individual security level.

### The Brinson Study: Asset Allocation Explains 91.5% of Returns

**Gary P. Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower** (1986, updated 1991) studied 91 large pension plans over 1974--1983. They attributed the variation in quarterly total returns to three factors:

| Factor | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **Asset Allocation Policy** | **91.5%** |
| Security Selection | 4.6% |
| Market Timing | 1.8% |
| Other Factors | 2.1% |

Despite this, the profession remains obsessively focused on security selection and market timing, because the hope of superior results has tremendous seductive appeal. As data emerge to refute the hypothesis that most managers can add value through timing and selection, the tendency is often to attempt to refit the data to the hypothesis.

### The Difficulty of Identifying Skill vs. Luck

If 1,000 managers make decisions on the basis of a random process like rolling dice: after year one, 500 will be above average; after year two, 250; by year five, roughly 30 will have outperformed every year -- purely by chance. **Professor Barr Rosenberg** developed a statistical approach showing that several decades of outperformance are typically required to confidently attribute results to skill rather than luck. By this yardstick, track records like Templeton's are truly exceptional.

### Modern Portfolio Theory as Evolution

Gibson draws an analogy to physics: Einstein did not invalidate Newton's laws but defined the limited context in which they were true. Similarly, modern portfolio theory does not invalidate security analysis; it prescribes limits within which it can add value. Without the financial analysis and trading of intelligent market participants, markets would not be efficient in the first place.

The goal shifts from beating the market to devising **long-term strategies that move investors to their goals with the least amount of risk**. These strategies do not fight capital markets so much as they intelligently ride with them.

> "Hindsight is always 20-20." -- Billy Wilder

### Managing Expectations Before Managing Money

Gibson's cardinal rule: **first manage the client's expectations, then manage their money**. Clients must share a common investment worldview with their advisor before any strategy is implemented. The "ideal investment" is a myth -- there are no liquid investment alternatives with stable guaranteed principal values which can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and income taxes. Any misconceptions that go uncorrected will surface later, often to the detriment of the investment management process.

### Data Foundation

All historical data come from **Ibbotson Associates' Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation**, covering **1926 through 1998** -- decades that include war and peace, inflation and deflation, multiple bull and bear market cycles. Performance figures are not adjusted for income taxes and generally do not include transaction costs. The wealth indices use a logarithmic scale, where a given vertical distance represents a specific percentage change regardless of where measured.

### Inflation (CPI-U): 3.1% Compound Annual Rate

- A $1 breakfast in 1925 cost $9.14 by 1998 -- a ninefold increase
- **1925--1932**: Deflationary, averaging -4.7% per year (breakfast fell to $0.73)
- **Post-WWII**: Unlike prior wars, no postwar deflation occurred; inflation persisted at a modest 2.8% compound annual rate for two decades
- **Mid-1960s through 1981**: Inflation compounded at ~7% annually, doubling the cost of living each decade
- **1982--1998**: Returned to a modest 3.3% compound annual rate
- Range: from -10.3% (1932) to +18.2% (1946)
- Persistent post-WWII inflation was a worldwide phenomenon; governments are primary beneficiaries because they tax nominal rather than real income, shifting wealth from the private to the public sector

### Treasury Bills: 3.8% Compound Annual Return

- Short-term government loans sold at a discount; free of default risk; stable principal value
- $1 invested at end of 1925 grew to $14.94 by end of 1998
- The real (inflation-adjusted) return: approximately 0.7% per year
- After income taxes, T-bill returns **lagged considerably behind inflation**
- Range: 0% to 14.7%
- Yields were artificially pegged at low levels during the 1940s, producing negative real returns; deregulated in 1951, after which yields tracked inflation more closely
- **Cash equivalents** (including commercial paper, money market funds) generally produce pre-tax returns of approximately 1% above inflation

**The "Safe Haven" Illusion (Table 2-1).** The 50-year-old widow example: $1 million in CDs at 5% with 4% inflation and a 30-year life expectancy. Even without touching a penny of principal, using only interest for living expenses:
- After 10 years: purchasing power of $1 million drops to $675,564; her $50,000 income buys only $33,778 of goods
- After 30 years: purchasing power drops to $306,319; income buys only $15,416 of goods

Many investors who fear equity risk seek what they perceive to be a safe haven in short-term interest-generating investments. Investors are often not sufficiently sensitive to inflation because of the time-lag way it takes its toll.

**Nominal vs. Real Returns.** During 1979--1981, T-bills returned 12.1%, but inflation was 11.5%. A 30% tax bracket investor earned 8.5% after tax -- producing a real after-tax loss. During 1982--1984, T-bills fell to 9.7% with inflation at only 3.9%, producing a positive real after-tax return of nearly 3%. The lower nominal returns were actually far better in real terms. Investors need to understand that the nominal illusion of wealth may increase when in fact it is eroding.

### Bonds: Key Concepts

Bonds are negotiable promissory notes paying a series of interest payments followed by return of principal at maturity. Key terms:
- **Par value**: face amount the issuer promises to repay
- **Coupon rate**: stated interest rate determining annual payments
- **Yield to maturity**: the internal rate of return equating the bond's future cash flows to its current market price
- **Current yield**: annual interest payments divided by current market price

The term "fixed income" is somewhat misleading -- only the maximum payment is fixed, not necessarily the income paid.

**The Inverse Relationship.** Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. If you buy a 7% coupon bond and rates rise to 8%, no one will pay full price for your $700 annual stream when $10,000 can buy an $800 stream. Your bond's price must fall until its total return (from the discount plus remaining payments) matches new market rates.

**Three Dimensions of Bond Risk:**
1. **Interest-rate-risk sensitivity**: longer maturity = more price fluctuation; historically a 1% change in one-year yields corresponds to only 0.6% and 0.3% changes in three-year and six-year yields. The marketplace normally prices bonds so that longer maturities with more price sensitivity have higher yields, giving rise to the **normal upward-sloping yield curve**. Interest-rate-risk sensitivity makes even U.S. government bonds risky.
2. **Creditworthiness**: from default-free government bonds (backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government) to varying degrees of corporate credit risk, with highest yields associated with the highest possibility of default
3. **Tax status**: municipal bonds issued by local and state governments may be free from federal income taxes and can be issued at lower yields; for high-bracket investors, always consider munis alongside taxable obligations

### Long-Term Government Bonds: 5.3% Compound Annual Return

$1 invested grew to $44.18 by 1998. Returns ranged from -9.2% (1967) to +40.4% (1982).

**Three Distinct Periods:**

1. **1926--1945 (Deflation/Low Inflation)**: Bonds excelled. Compound annual return of 4.7%; with near-zero inflation, real returns were nearly identical to nominal. Yields trended down within 2--4%, producing capital appreciation that reached its 73-year peak of $1.47. With the notable exception of 1931 (-5.3%), all years had positive total returns.

2. **1946--1981 (Prolonged Bear Market for Bonds)**: Compound inflation of 4.7% drove yields relentlessly higher. Bond compound annual return was only 2% -- less than half of T-bills' 4.1%. The capital appreciation index fell from its peak of $1.42 to a 73-year low of $0.48 -- a cumulative capital loss of more than two-thirds before considering additional inflation damage. By 1981, the cumulative performance of T-bills actually surpassed long-term government bonds. No period more clearly demonstrates the danger of buying "safe" long-term government bonds and spending the interest for living expenses.

3. **1982--1998 (The Great Bond Rally)**: Inflation and rates dropped precipitously. In 1982 alone, government bonds returned 40%. In the 56 years before 1982, only two years (1952 and 1976) exceeded 15% total return; after 1982, eight more years did (1984, 1985, 1986, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997). The spectacular returns re-established bonds' long-term performance advantage over T-bills.

**Three Components of Government Bond Yield:**
1. Inflation component
2. Real riskless interest rate
3. Premium for bearing interest rate risk

The policy of consistently spending all three components is a prescription for long-term trouble. An investor can be assured of receiving the yield to maturity only by holding a bond until maturity; selling prior exposes the investor to intervening interest rate movements.

### Intermediate-Term Government Bonds: 5.3% Compound Annual Return

Surprisingly, intermediate-term bonds (maturities of not less than five years) matched long-term bonds' compound return ($43.93 vs. $44.18 from $1). Long-term bonds had higher income but suffered a slight cumulative capital loss; intermediate bonds had lower income but appreciated at 0.4% annually. These offsets produced nearly identical total returns -- but with **far less volatility**:
- Intermediate bonds had negative returns in only **7 of 73 years** vs. **20 for long-term bonds**
- 1994's six Federal Reserve rate hikes produced intermediate bonds' worst single-year loss: -5.14% (vs. -7.77% for long-term bonds)

The lesson: longer maturity does not always mean higher total return, because the upside is matched by a correspondingly worse downside.

### Long-Term Corporate Bonds: 5.8% Compound Annual Return

$1 grew to $61.34. The 0.5% annual premium over government bonds reflects the **default premium** -- compensation for credit risk. Because corporate bonds have the possibility of default, expected return will be less than yield to maturity. Lower-quality bonds have historically provided higher net returns after adjustments for capital losses. Returns on low-quality bonds are more volatile because of greater sensitivity to stock price movements.

### Large Company Stocks (S&P 500): 11.2% Compound Annual Return

$1 invested at end of 1925 grew to **$2,350.89** by end of 1998. Key milestones:
- Grew rapidly to $2.20 by end of 1928, then the crash and Depression took it to a 73-year low of $0.84 by end of 1932
- By end of 1944, stocks had made up lost ground, surpassing long-term corporate bonds for the first time and maintaining the lead thereafter
- The 1982--1987 bull market produced a 250%+ advance (nearly 30% compounded annually from trough to peak)
- October 19, 1987: the largest single-day decline in history, with prices falling over 20%, followed by a quick recovery in the next bull market beginning December 4, 1987

**The "Miracle of Compound Interest"**: Large stocks returned only 7.4% more than T-bills, yet produced **over 157 times** the accumulated wealth over 73 years.

**Capital appreciation alone** (ending value $96.36) was over 10 times the CPI ($9.14), meaning even if all dividends had been spent for living expenses, large stocks' price appreciation would have stayed well ahead of inflation. Stocks are a long-term "inflation-indexed investment" because corporations can raise the prices of their goods and services to match inflation.

**Performance by Inflation Environment:**
- Best in low, stable inflation with relatively stable growth in consumer prices
- Poor during deflation or high inflation
- Unanticipated inflation is especially harmful in the short run, though over longer periods corporations can make adjustments

**Dividend Income Stability.** The standard deviation of stock income returns is only 1.4%, vs. 19.6% for capital appreciation -- virtually all of stock volatility comes from price movements, not dividend changes. Corporations set dividends at rates comfortably payable through good and bad years, resisting cuts unless absolutely necessary and raising them only when confident of relatively permanent earnings improvements. This produces a relatively stable, gradually increasing dividend stream.

The capacity of a common stock portfolio to produce a relatively stable, growing dividend stream is critical for the investor who wants to maintain purchasing power. Had the 50-year-old widow described in Table 2-1 allocated a portion of her money to common stocks, her portfolio would not have been so susceptible to the devastating impact of inflation.

**Stocks vs. Bonds: The Forward-Looking Case.** If 3.5% annual inflation doubles prices over two decades, and corporations maintain the same production levels, profit margins, and price-earnings ratios, then corporate earnings and share prices will likewise double. With common stocks, anticipated inflation is priced into expected returns, but the portfolio can also maintain its purchasing power while generating a growing dividend stream. By contrast, bonds promise only the return of principal in nominal terms with a fixed-income return -- in essence, you also have the assurance that your principal will lose to inflation.

### Small Company Stocks: 12.4% Compound Annual Return

$1 grew to **$5,116.65**. The **small stock premium** of 1.2% over large stocks reflects:
1. Higher volatility (standard deviation 33.8% vs. 20.3%) demanding more compensation
2. Higher betas making them more susceptible to overall market movements
3. Growth potential: large companies may be in mature businesses with rapid growth behind them; small companies may have more growth ahead

The small stock premium has a serial correlation of 0.39, indicating it follows a trend -- there are prolonged periods when one category outperforms the other.

### Bond Duration (Appendix)

Maturity is an inadequate measure of interest-rate sensitivity because it considers only the timing of principal repayment, ignoring interim interest payments. **Duration** -- the present-value-weighted average time until all cash flows are received -- is superior.

Example: A 7% coupon bond with 3-year maturity priced at $9,742 (8% yield to maturity) has a duration of **2.81 years**, less than its 3-year maturity because of the consideration given to interim interest payments. A zero-coupon bond's duration equals its maturity.

A bond with a six-year duration and 8% yield: a 50-basis-point yield decrease causes approximately 6 x 0.5% = 3% price increase, to $10,300.

**Positive Convexity.** When yields increase, duration shortens (making the bond less susceptible to further loss). When yields decrease, duration lengthens (making the bond more susceptible to further gain). This asymmetry is advantageous to the bondholder in both directions, producing realized returns better than expected given the bond's yield.

## Chapter 3: Comparative Relationships Among Capital Market Investment Alternatives

> "The best way to suppose what may come is to remember what is passed." -- George Savile

### Return Models Built on Historical Premiums

Gibson constructs a layered model where each asset class adds a premium above T-bills:

| Component | Premium | Model |
|---|---|---|
| T-bill yield | -- | Expected inflation + 0.7% real riskless rate |
| LT government bonds | +1.5% **horizon premium** | T-bill yield + 1.5% |
| LT corporate bonds | +0.5% **default premium** | T-bill yield + 2.0% |
| Large company stocks | +7.4% **equity risk premium** | T-bill yield + 7.4% |
| Small company stocks | +1.2% **small stock premium** | T-bill yield + 8.6% |

The horizon premium of 1.5% was derived by subtracting T-bill returns (3.8%) from long-term government bond returns (5.3%), then adjusting for any unanticipated capital gain or loss in the bond portfolio (which happened to be 0.0% over the full period). If there had been cumulative capital appreciation, a downward adjustment would be needed; if cumulative loss, an upward adjustment.

**Important caveats**: These models are based on long-term averages across many different subperiods. The equity risk premium varies widely -- Figure 3-1 shows its rolling five-year volatility and the variability is quite apparent. During periods when the yield curve is flat or inverted, the models need modification. The models provide single-point estimates; clients need to understand the probabilistic range of outcomes.

**Correcting Misperceptions.** In the late 1970s, clients asked: "Why invest in risky stocks for 11.2% when I can get 12% from T-bills?" The answer: 11.2% was achieved when T-bills returned 3.8% in an average inflation environment of 3.1%. In a 12% T-bill environment, the model projects stocks at approximately 19.4%. Returns should always be compared as arithmetic differences (spreads), never multiplicatively.

### Summary Statistics (Table 3-1, 1926--1998)

| Asset Class | Geometric Mean | Arithmetic Mean | Std Deviation | Serial Correlation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small company stocks | 12.4% | 17.4% | 33.8% | 0.09 |
| Large company stocks | 11.2% | 13.2% | 20.3% | 0.01 |
| LT corporate bonds | 5.8% | 6.1% | 8.6% | 0.10 |
| LT government bonds | 5.3% | 5.7% | 9.2% | -0.01 |
| IT government bonds | 5.3% | 5.5% | 5.7% | 0.18 |
| Treasury bills | 3.8% | 3.8% | 3.2% | 0.92 |
| Inflation | 3.1% | 3.2% | 4.5% | 0.65 |

Higher returns are obtained at the price of more volatility. Stock and long-term bond total returns have near-zero serial correlation (resembling random walks), while income components and T-bill returns show high serial correlation (trending behavior).

### The Miracle of Compound Interest

Small incremental differences in return produce enormous differences in wealth:
- T-bills (3.8%): $1 became $14.94
- Large stocks (11.2%, just 7.4% more): $1 became $2,350.89
- Small stocks (12.4%, just 1.2% more than large): $1 became $5,116.65

Clients are often surprised by how small incremental advantages compound over time.

### Geometric Mean vs. Arithmetic Mean (Appendix)

Example: A stock rises 25% in year one ($100 to $125), then falls 20% in year two ($125 back to $100). The arithmetic mean is +2.5%, but the geometric mean (compound return) is 0%. The arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean; the gap widens with greater variability. Only when returns are constant are the two measures equal.

The disparity arises because it takes a larger percentage of above-average performance to offset a given percentage of below-average performance. Use **geometric means** for multi-period wealth accumulation comparisons; use **arithmetic means** for single-period expected return estimates.

Gibson uses arithmetic differences (not geometric differences) to derive risk premiums because most clients think of the difference between 5% and 12% as 7%, not 6.7%. This simpler approach does not impair the conceptual value of the models.

### Standard Deviation, the Normal Distribution, and Serial Correlation

A **normal distribution** (bell-shaped curve) is completely specified by its mean and standard deviation. **68% of outcomes fall within one standard deviation** of the mean; **95% within two standard deviations**. Example: Common stock ABC with expected return of 15% and standard deviation of 20% has a two-out-of-three chance of returning between -5% and +35%, and a 95% chance of returning between -25% and +55%.

Security returns are more accurately described by a **lognormal distribution** (bounded at -100% on the downside, open-ended on the upside), but Gibson uses normal distributions for simplicity throughout.

**Serial correlation** measures the predictability of a return series from one period to the next. Near +1.0 indicates a trend; near -1.0 indicates highly cyclical behavior; near 0 indicates a random walk (no predictable pattern). Key serial correlations from Table 3-1:
- T-bill returns: 0.92 (strong trend -- each year's return is predictive of the next)
- Stock income returns: 0.84 (dividends follow stable trends)
- LT government bond income: 0.97 (very stable coupon streams)
- Stock total returns: 0.01 (essentially a random walk -- past performance does not predict future)
- LT government bond total returns: -0.01 (also random walk)
- Small stock premium: 0.39 (not in the table but notable -- suggests prolonged periods when one size category outperforms the other)

The variability of principal value in stocks and long-term bonds overwhelms the trending behavior of their income components, making total returns approximate random walks.

## Chapter 4: Market Timing

> "The evidence on investment managers' success with market timing is impressive -- and overwhelmingly negative." -- Charles D. Ellis

> "He that cannot abide a bad market, deserves not a good one." -- John Ray (1678)

### The Impossible Dream

A perfect market timer switching annually among T-bills, corporate bonds, large stocks, and small stocks from 1926 through 1998 would have turned $1 into **over $20 million**. Had $1 million been invested, the result would exceed $20 trillion -- substantially more than the $13 trillion market value of all publicly traded U.S. stocks. Our 1925 millionaire would now own all of corporate America and approximately half of all non-U.S. companies. Such timing ability does not exist.

### Why Random Markets Look Predictable

The resolution lies in recognizing that **a random series of numbers does not always look random**. Flip a coin 100 times and you will notice occasional runs of heads or tails, but each flip is independent of the preceding one. Similarly, prolonged bull and bear markets are not predictable trends -- they are random sequences that look patterned in hindsight.

**Efficient markets** incorporate into current security prices all relevant known information plus consensus expectations regarding the unknown. What moves the market is information that was not previously known -- surprises, which are random events by definition. Occasionally there are more good surprises than bad (bull market), other times the reverse (bear market). Knowing whether we are at war or at peace, have a Republican or Democrat in the White House, or are in an expansion or contraction is of no predictive value -- all this is already priced in.

### The Statistical Case Against Timing

**Trinity Investment Management** studied ten post-WWII stock market cycles (May 1946 -- August 1987):
- Up months outnumber down months 1.7 to 1 (309 vs. 187)
- Average bull market: +104.8% over 41 months; average bear market: -28% over 14 months
- Bull markets last nearly three times as long as bear markets
- Within bear markets, 3--4 months out of 10 are still up months (making it hard to know you are in a bear market until well after the fact)
- In bull markets, just **8 months** (out of 41) accounted for **more than 60%** of the total gain

**William Sharpe** found that a market timer must be right **roughly three out of four times** merely to match a buy-and-hold competitor, because: (1) the timer will often be in cash during good years, sacrificing higher stock returns; (2) he will incur transaction costs from switches, many unprofitable.

**Robert Jeffrey** showed that if a stock investor missed just the **seven best years** out of 73 (1926--1998), a $1 investment declined from $2,351 to just $202:

> "The superior returns available from common stocks do not accrue in a uniform manner. Rather, they can be traced to a few periods of sudden bursts of strength... these positive surges often occur when pessimism is running high."

**Chua and Woodward** concluded it is more important to correctly forecast bull markets than bear markets. Required forecast accuracies for timing to pay: at least 80% bull/50% bear, 70% bull/80% bear, or 60% bull/90% bear. With only 50% accuracy on bull markets, you should not practice timing at all, even with perfect bear market forecasts.

**Charles Ellis** cited a study of 100 large pension funds: while all had attempted market timing, not one improved its return. **89 out of 100 lost**, averaging a 4.5% loss over five years.

### The 1990--1991 Example

At the end of 1990, stocks had posted a loss (-3.71%), recession was upon us, and the Persian Gulf War loomed. Many clients and money management firms argued it was a good time to be out of stocks with money safely in T-bills. Gibson urged them to remain invested -- not because he predicted a rally, but because it is impossible to know when the particularly good periods will occur. 1991 posted a **30.55% advance**, much of it quickly after the war began. Those who fled to cash missed it entirely.

### The Persistent Allure Despite Evidence

Over any given period there will be a wide dispersion of investor experiences, with some doing very well and some very poorly -- statistically expected. The danger is the leap of logic presuming that good results come from superior predictive ability. Successful market timing firms are written up in financial publications and interviewed on television; unsuccessful ones fade away as clients flee to the latest guru. Many investors prefer to live with false hope rather than critically examine whether timing is possible.

> "A plausible impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility." -- Aristotle

### The Paradox of Timing

If market timing actually worked, investors buying before rises and selling before declines would smooth out volatility. But **when common stock volatility disappears, so does the reward for bearing it**. The market timer's worldview implies money is made in common stocks **despite** the volatility. Gibson's worldview: money is made **because of** the volatility.

Ellis

### Two Categories of Investments

All investments divide naturally into two groups, whether ranked by return or by volatility. The biggest gap in both rankings falls between long-term corporate bonds and large company stocks:

| | Interest-Generating (Loaner) | Equity (Owner) |
|---|---|---|
| **Examples** | T-bills, intermediate bonds, long-term bonds | Large stocks, small stocks |
| **Primary advantage** | Predictable cash flows; specified payments | Long-term real capital growth; no upper limit |
| **Major disadvantage** | Susceptible to inflation; no growth | High short-run volatility; no promised return |
| **Appropriate for** | Short time horizons | Long time horizons |

A low return is the price paid by the loaner who wants a more predictable outcome. Short-run volatility is the price paid by the owner who wants long-term capital growth. The two most important risks in money management are **inflation** (most damaging to loaners) and **volatility** (most pronounced for owners).

### Why Investors Over-Fear Volatility

Three reasons investors fear stock volatility more than inflation:

1. **Immediacy**: The stock market can drop 20% in a single day (October 19, 1987); the worst annual inflation was 13%. Volatility inflicts visible, dramatic damage; inflation is insidious, taking its toll little by little.

2. **Nominal thinking**: During 1979--1980, T-bills yielded 10--11% and investors fondly remember "the good old days" of high returns, not recognizing that 12--13% inflation produced negative real returns. The lower single-digit returns of the mid-1980s were actually far superior in real terms. It would be interesting to see how perceptions would change if T-bill returns were routinely reported in inflation-adjusted terms.

3. **Permanence illusion**: Investors who suffered through the 1973--74 bear market sold near the bottom and said "Common stocks? -- never again," thereby missing one of the century's best bull markets. They incorrectly conclude that common stock losses are permanent.

### The Economics of Volatility Aversion

Economists explain volatility aversion through **declining marginal utility of wealth**: each additional dollar adds to well-being but at a declining rate. An extra $100 means more to someone with $1,000 net worth than to a millionaire. In investment terms, the additional dollar gained from a good outcome is not as valuable as the dollar lost from a bad outcome.

**Example**: Given two investments with identical 7% expected returns but different volatilities (Investment A: 2% standard deviation; Investment B: 4% standard deviation), rational investors always choose A. In the real world, investors sell B to buy A, driving up A's price and down B's, until in equilibrium B has a higher expected return to compensate for its greater volatility. The same mechanism operates between T-bills and common stocks -- the buying and selling activities of investors cause stocks to be priced to provide higher expected returns as compensation for bearing equity volatility.

### If Market Timing Worked: The Paradox Restated

If investors could easily time the market, their buying and selling would smooth out volatility. But when volatility disappears, so does the reward. Perfect market timing creates a paradox: common stocks retain their short-run unpredictable volatility precisely because it is the foundation on which their higher long-term returns are built.

### Time Transforms Volatility from Enemy to Friend

Large company stocks outperformed T-bills:
- **64%** of individual years (47 of 73)
- **84%** of rolling 5-year periods
- **94%** of rolling 10-year periods
- **100%** of rolling 20-year periods (and 25-year periods)

**Table 5-1 detail**: For 1-year holding periods, large stocks outperformed other alternatives in 59% of cases, but returns ranged from -43.3% to +54.0%. For 10-year periods, stocks dominated in 78% of cases, and the worst outcome was a compound -0.9% (even then, $1,000 was still worth $913). For 20-year periods, stocks dominated 94% of the time; only the 20-year periods beginning 1928, 1929, and 1930 (the Great Depression) saw corporate bonds outperform stocks.

Using rolling monthly (not just calendar-year) starting points to capture a more comprehensive range of outcomes, all 240-month (20-year) holding periods produced positive compound annual returns for large stocks. The median return was approximately the same across 12-, 60-, 120-, and 240-month holding periods -- only the range narrowed dramatically.

> "The volatility of common stocks is undoubtedly an enemy in the short run, but it is the basis for their higher expected returns. Time transforms this short-run enemy into a friend for the long-term investor."

### The Daily Perspective

The 7.4% annual equity risk premium allocated across 365 days is negligible. On any given day, stocks have essentially a 50/50 chance of beating T-bills. The standard deviation of 20.3% completely swamps the equity risk premium in the short run -- the same is true for one-month and one-year horizons. Short-term stock performance is meaningless noise for a long-term investor.

### The Miracle of Compounding Over Time

Assuming T-bills at 5% and stocks at 12%: in only **11 years**, cumulative stock wealth doubles that of T-bills; by **17 years**, stocks are worth three times T-bills. The modest-sounding 7.4% equity risk premium produced over 157 times the T-bill wealth over 73 years.

In summary, volatility swamps the expected payoff from common stocks in the short run, making them a risk not worth taking on short horizons. But in the long run, stocks emerge as the winner because of the convergence of average returns around their higher expected return, coupled with the miracle of compound interest.

**Time horizon is the key variable** in determining the appropriate balance of interest-generating versus equity investments.

## Chapter 6: A Model for Determining Broad Portfolio Balance

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." -- Albert Einstein

### The Data-Gathering Process

The client/advisor relationship begins by collecting both **objective data** (assets, liabilities, income, taxes, family composition, employment, legal constraints) and **subjective data** (psychology, hopes and dreams, opinions and preferences regarding investments, and tolerance for various types of risk).

### Five Key Areas of Client Assessment

**1. Specific Goals.** Goals like "early retirement" or "college for the kids" must be made specific: At what age? What lifestyle? What income level? Which schools -- private or public? What about tuition inflation? The advisor helps flesh out vague aspirations into quantifiable targets. Institutional clients with quantifiable future benefit payments can develop even greater specificity.

**2. Investment Objectives.** Goals are often more ambitious than realistically achievable. The common pattern: investors decide to get serious about retirement just a few years before, by which point the achievable lifestyle has been largely predetermined. Human desires tend to exceed available resources. Objectives must be prioritized, sometimes compromised, and built on realistic capital market assumptions.

**3. Investment Knowledge.** Questionnaires listing investment alternatives are only a starting point -- not a basis for inferring volatility tolerance or choosing portfolio building blocks. A client who says she "knows about" stocks may not understand them sufficiently for informed decisions. Gibson's medical analogy:

> "A physician will not recommend a course of treatment based on the patient's familiarity with various prescription drugs."

A client who says he has never invested in bonds and prefers not to may be expressing unfamiliarity, not informed judgment.

**4. Risks.** Professionals define risk as standard deviation; clients define it as chance of loss. Clients are more accurately described as **"loss-averse" rather than "risk-averse"** -- year-to-year variability may not trouble them as long as there are no negative returns. Beneath loss aversion lurks a conviction that negative returns represent permanent capital losses.

Key problems with client risk perception:
- **Nominal vs. real thinking**: 5% gain in 12% inflation feels better than -1% loss in 4% inflation, though the latter is actually a smaller real loss (-5% vs. -7%)
- **Familiarity bias**: Without guidance, clients assume familiar = safe, unfamiliar = risky. Real estate professionals who consider themselves very risk-averse yet hold highly leveraged property respond: "There's no risk there. I understand real estate and am comfortable with it!"
- **Terminology confusion**: It is a mistake to use "risk" and "volatility" interchangeably. For the long-term investor, the equity-oriented portfolio is the **low-risk** strategy because it protects against inflation

**5. Volatility Tolerance.** This is not a fixed characteristic like eye color. It can be modified through education -- often toward greater comfort with equities for long horizons, sometimes toward greater caution for short horizons. Whatever approach is used to assess it, it is dangerous to develop a strategy based solely on an initial assessment that inappropriately presumes clients already know what is in their best interest. If their risk perceptions are inaccurate, they cannot make wise decisions.

The informed modification of volatility tolerance is one of the advisor's **major responsibilities** and represents a great opportunity to add value.

### The Portfolio Balance Model: A Five-Step Methodology

**Step 1.** Verify the client understands the volatility/return characteristics of T-bills (5% return, no volatility) and large stocks (12% modeled return = T-bill yield + 7.4% equity risk premium, volatility +/-20%).

**Step 2.** Review how time horizon determines whether volatility or inflation is the greater risk.

**Step 3.** Determine the total portfolio value broadly -- including:
- All liquid and nonliquid investments (e.g., investment real estate)
- Employer-sponsored retirement plans (even without investment discretion)
- Present value of annuitized income streams (important economic assets seldom on the balance sheet)

This focuses the client on the "big picture."

**Step 4.** Have the client hypothetically convert everything to cash, overcoming inertia and freeing them from the ghosts of past decisions.

**Step 5.** In a world with only two investments (T-bills and large stocks), ask the client to allocate:

| Portfolio | T-Bills | Stocks | Modeled Return | Volatility (+/-) | Typical Range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100% | 0% | 5.0% | 0.0% | 5.0% |
| 2 | 70% | 30% | 7.1% | 6.0% | 1.1% to 13.1% |
| 3 | 50% | 50% | 8.5% | 10.0% | -1.5% to 18.5% |
| 4 | 30% | 70% | 9.9% | 14.0% | -4.1% to 23.9% |
| 5 | 0% | 100% | 12.0% | 20.0% | -8.0% to 32.0% |

Calculations: Portfolio 2 return = 0.70(5%) + 0.30(12%) = 7.1%; volatility = 0.70(0%) + 0.30(20%) = 6.0%.

### Understanding the Trade-Off

By dividing the 20% standard deviation by the 7% equity risk premium, we see that for every **1% increase in modeled return, volatility increases by approximately +/-2.9%**. To increase modeled return by just 2.1% (from 5.0% to 7.1%), we must accept +/-6.0% additional volatility. The incremental volatility rises much faster than the incremental return.

**Clients often believe returns are more easily achieved with less volatility** than the model indicates. If there is going to be a struggle over the volatility/return trade-off, it is best to deal with it now. Generally, clients accept the framework because the alternative requires rejecting over seven decades of historical relationships in favor of a different investment mythology.

**Focus on volatility tolerance, not return requirement.** Most clients require unrealistically high returns. If the return at maximum tolerable volatility is insufficient, the client should modify goals or acknowledge they will most likely not be realized. If the return at maximum tolerance exceeds what is needed, the client can move to a more stable portfolio.

### Time Horizon and the Probability Distribution of Outcomes

For clients needing more detail, Gibson provides distributions of annualized returns over 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 25-year horizons for each portfolio.

**Example -- Portfolio 3 (50/50 split):**
- 1-year, 10th percentile: -3.97% (90% chance of doing better)
- 5-year, 10th percentile: +2.49%
- 25-year, 10th percentile: +5.52% (meaning a 90% chance of beating the 5% T-bill return)

In other words, with a 25-year horizon, the chances are 9 out of 10 that a 50/50 mix will outperform an all-T-bill portfolio. Longer time horizons mean more opportunity for good and bad years to offset each other, dramatically narrowing the range of outcomes.

A client who requests "12% returns with little or no risk" is expressing two competing objectives. The model forces acknowledgment that to the extent one is pursued, the other must be sacrificed.

### Key Insights from the Model

- **Short-term performance is noise.** The 40.6 percentage points of relative volatility (one standard deviation range) dwarf the 7.4% reward. A quarterly or annual performance report does not measure return so much as it measures volatility around a long-term growth path completely obscured by the noise. The path becomes clear only in retrospect.
- **Portfolio-balance decisions are nondelegatable** (Charles Ellis). The client must make this choice; the advisor provides the framework. The client's portfolio selection is an indirect measure of informed volatility tolerance.
- **Volatility tolerance evolves.** This exercise should be repeated periodically. Clients who thought they could tolerate stock volatility may temper their views after a crash like October 1987. Life events -- family changes, career shifts, health problems -- also alter tolerance.
- **Historical grounding matters.** Discuss specific events like the 1973--74 bear market (stocks lost 40%+). Such declines will surely happen again. Clients should be educated to expect that.
- **Lognormal distributions.** The actual return distributions in the book use the more realistic lognormal assumption (impossible to lose more than 100%, but upside is open-ended), producing asymmetric ranges around the expected return.

### From Broad Balance to Diversification

The balance chosen between interest-generating and equity investments is the most important investment decision the client will make. It simultaneously determines both the general volatility level and the return characteristics of the portfolio. Subject to this broad decision, the advisor can proceed to design a more diversified portfolio utilizing multiple asset classes -- which brings us to the concept of diversification as the "third dimension."

### Technical Note

Gibson acknowledges a dilemma: technically, the standard deviation should be measured around the arithmetic average return, not the compound return. Using the arithmetic return, however, might mislead clients into thinking their money will compound at that higher rate. Using the compound return avoids this problem. In Gibson's judgment, the technical inaccuracy serves the more important consideration of the client's conceptual understanding: clients naturally think of compound returns within a time horizon context, yet their experience of volatility will be in the near term.
## Chapter 7: Diversification: The Third Dimension

> "Better a steady dime than a rare dollar." --Anonymous

### Beyond Naive Diversification

Diversification is far more powerful and subtle than simply "not putting all your eggs in one basket." Gibson introduces a **third dimension** -- the **diversification effect** -- to complement the two-dimensional world of volatility and return.

Three scenarios illustrate the concept:

- **Perfect positive correlation (+1.0)**: Two investments moving in lockstep. Combining them merely averages their volatilities. No diversification effect exists.
- **Perfect negative correlation (-1.0)**: Two investments moving in opposite cycles. Combining them can completely eliminate portfolio volatility while retaining a weighted-average return. This is the maximum diversification effect -- but such perfectly negatively correlated investments do not exist in reality.
- **Middle-ground correlation**: The real-world situation. Investments sometimes move together, sometimes apart. Portfolio volatility falls below the weighted average of its components' volatilities, producing a genuine diversification benefit.

The key insight: **portfolio return is always a weighted average of component returns**, regardless of correlation. But **portfolio volatility is less than the weighted average** of component volatilities in all cases except perfect positive correlation.

### The Minimum Volatility Portfolio

Applying this to stocks and bonds (1926-1998 data: large company stocks returned 13.2% with 20.3% standard deviation; long-term corporate bonds returned 6.1% with 8.6% standard deviation; correlation of +0.26):

- The minimum volatility portfolio is **not** 100% bonds -- it is **93% bonds and 7% stocks**, with a standard deviation of 8.5% (lower than bonds' 8.6%) and an expected return of 6.2% (higher than bonds' 6.1%)
- A portfolio of 85% bonds/15% stocks matches bond volatility but delivers a full percentage point more in expected return
- **Ultraconservative investors holding only bonds are missing a free lunch** -- they can simultaneously improve returns and reduce volatility through modest equity diversification

### Variability in Historical Relationships

Rolling 60-month analyses reveal sobering instability in all three key statistics:

- **Returns**: The dominance of stocks over bonds is apparent over long periods, but over 5-year windows, stocks frequently lag bonds
- **Volatility**: Common stock volatility peaked before World War II; bond volatility was low until the mid-1960s, then surged through the 1980s as the interest rate environment became volatile
- **Correlations**: Stock/bond correlation varied from +0.62 to -0.28 over the 1926-1998 period, despite the overall figure of +0.26. The strongest diversification effect occurs during periods of negative correlation

This variability is a critical warning about the uncertainty inherent in optimization inputs. Historical data are **helpful** in understanding investment relationships, but cannot be massaged to extract "the truth" from what is basically an uncertain process.

### The Efficient Frontier

With three or more investment alternatives, many different allocations can produce the same expected return but with different volatility levels. The **efficient frontier** is the set of portfolios that minimize volatility for each level of expected return. Key principles:

- **Efficient portfolios** maximize return for a given volatility (or minimize volatility for a given return)
- **Inefficient portfolios** carry unnecessary volatility without compensation -- this is not a "free lunch" but rather "volatility needlessly incurred without compensation"
- More investment alternatives expand the efficient frontier upward, creating better risk-return possibilities
- Any artificial restriction on investment choices confines investors to a lower efficient frontier

### Diversification as Return Enhancement

Although usually framed as volatility reduction, diversification equally serves as **return enhancement**. This matters because aggressive investors often dismiss diversification, believing it will impair returns. In fact, the diversification effect enables more aggressive investors to commit a **greater percentage to equity investments** than would otherwise be possible, because the smoothing effect of partially offsetting returns allows more risk to be taken at the portfolio level.

### Diversifiable vs. Nondiversifiable Volatility

If we took diversification to its logical conclusion by representing all major investment alternatives, would we eliminate all portfolio volatility? No -- the remaining volatility is **nondiversifiable volatility**, inherent in the market as a whole.

Gibson uses a firefighter analogy: a firefighter deserves compensation for the unavoidable risks of the job (nondiversifiable volatility), but not for removing his protective suit before entering a burning building (diversifiable volatility).

> One big lesson of modern portfolio theory is that in an efficient market, there is no compensation for bearing volatility that can be easily avoided.

A stock with high total volatility but low nondiversifiable volatility will be priced to provide a **lower** expected return than a stock with less total volatility but more nondiversifiable volatility. The market assumes investors are smart enough to diversify away avoidable risk.

### The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The CAPM, developed by **William F. Sharpe** in the mid-1960s, formalizes these ideas. Under its assumptions (identical information, no transaction costs, tax-free world), all investors hold the same **market portfolio** -- composed of all volatile assets weighted by market value. The formula:

**R_i = R_f + (R_m - R_f) x Beta_i**

**Beta** measures an asset's nondiversifiable volatility relative to the market portfolio. The **Security Market Line (SML)** plots expected return against beta, showing the upward-sloping relationship between nondiversifiable risk and expected return.

## Chapter 8: The Rewards of Multiple-Asset-Class Investing

> "My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, / Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate / Upon the fortune of this present year." --William Shakespeare, *Merchant of Venice*

### The Case for Global Diversification

As of 1998, non-U.S. capital markets were as large as U.S. markets. Gibson poses a thought experiment: two identical investment firms, one restricted to U.S. stocks and bonds, one investing globally. The global firm's worst case is matching the domestic firm; its best case is finding attractive opportunities unavailable domestically.

### International Bonds

Rolling 20-year analysis shows that adding 10-30% international bonds to a domestic bond portfolio improved returns and reduced volatility in almost every period examined. The **theory of interest rate parity** explains why high foreign coupon rates don't fully translate to U.S. investor returns -- higher foreign interest rates often accompany higher inflation, triggering currency depreciation.

### International Stocks

Using the **EAFE Index** (Europe, Australia, Far East): in 8 of 10 rolling 20-year periods, international stock diversification (10-30%) improved portfolio returns. Portfolio volatility was consistently lower with international exposure. Special risks include accounting differences, liquidity constraints, political instability, currency risk, and capital flow restrictions.

> In essence, every international investment is two investments: one in the security itself and the other in the native foreign currency.

### Real Estate and REITs

Real estate is unique -- non-interchangeable, non-liquid properties that may be less efficiently priced than stocks or bonds. **Equity REITs** (Real Estate Investment Trusts) provide accessible diversification across property types and geographies with a relatively small investment. By stock market standards, equity REITs generate above-average yields and have smaller capitalizations.

### The Blindfolded Portfolio Exercise

Gibson's most compelling demonstration uses four equity asset classes from 1972-1997:

- **A**: S&P 500 (domestic stocks)
- **B**: EAFE Index (international stocks)
- **C**: NAREIT Equity Index (real estate)
- **D**: Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (commodities)

Fifteen portfolios (all single-, two-, three-, and four-asset-class combinations, equally weighted) are plotted in volatility/return space. When audiences choose blindly, they consistently prefer more diversified portfolios -- confirming the pattern that multiple-asset-class portfolios dominate single-asset-class portfolios.

### The Surprising Results

| Portfolio Type | Avg Compound Return | Avg Std Dev | Avg Sharpe Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Four-asset-class | 14.38% | 10.30% | 0.71 |
| Three-asset-class | 14.23% | 11.55% | 0.66 |
| Two-asset-class | 13.95% | 13.99% | 0.58 |
| One-asset-class | 13.18% | 19.55% | 0.40 |

The four-asset-class portfolio had **1.2 percentage points higher return** with **47% less volatility** than the average single-asset-class portfolio. Its Sharpe ratio was nearly **twice** the average of its components.

**The GSCI paradox**: The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index had the lowest return and highest volatility of any single asset class, yet every one of the 5 highest-returning portfolios and 7 least-volatile portfolios included GSCI as a component -- because its **dissimilar pattern of returns** produced the strongest diversification effect.

**The REITs paradox**: Equity REITs had the highest return with least volatility of any single asset class (1972-1997). Yet a portfolio of the other three asset classes (ABD) generated a **higher return with approximately 50% less volatility** than REITs alone -- even though each of those three asset classes individually had lower returns and more volatility than REITs.

### End-Point Sensitivity: The 1998 Warning

The year 1998 produced strikingly different returns (S&P 500: +28.58%, EAFE: +20.33%, NAREIT: -17.50%, GSCI: -35.75%). Adding this single year dramatically reshuffled the rankings: REITs fell from first to third place in return; the S&P 500 jumped from thirteenth to fifth. This underscores the danger of naively extrapolating any asset class's relative performance.

### Downside Risk Reduction

Examining the five worst years (1972-1998) for each single asset class versus the four-asset-class portfolio:

- Every single-asset class had at least one year with losses worse than -20%
- The four-asset-class portfolio's worst year was a modest loss of **-7.63%** (1974)
- Portfolio ABCD also experienced **fewer years of negative returns** than any single-asset class

Most of this downside improvement came from the GSCI's tendency to perform countercyclically to other asset classes, which proved especially valuable during the 1973-74 bear market.

### Why Isn't Everyone Doing It?

Three reasons:

**1. Lack of awareness.** Investors believe diversification impairs returns. The data show it tends to improve them.

**2. Market timing illusion.** Gibson's test: a market timer who perfectly predicted the winning asset class each year (1984-1998) would have earned 32.19% compound annually. Among nearly 600 mutual funds with 15+ year track records, **not one** came remotely close. Even a timer who only predicted the second-best asset class would have beaten all but 5 of 600 funds.

**3. Frame-of-reference bias.** U.S. investors compare results to the S&P 500. When U.S. stocks lead, diversified portfolios feel like losers. As one client admitted: "I would rather follow an inferior strategy that wins when my friends are winning than a superior strategy that at times results in my losing when my friends are winning."

### The Tortoise and Hare

> The multiple-asset-class strategy is a tortoise-and-hare story. The GSCI rabbit led the first third of the race during the 1970s. The EAFE rabbit ran fastest in the 1980s. The S&P 500 rabbit outpaced all others in the 1990s. Yet the tortoise, in the long run, leaves the pack behind.

## Chapter 9: Portfolio Optimization

> "All business proceeds on beliefs, on judgments of probabilities and not on certainties." --Charles W. Eliot

### How Optimization Works

An **efficient portfolio** is one where each asset's volatility-adjusted incremental contribution to portfolio expected return is equal. If contributions are unequal, swapping from the lowest contributor to the highest improves the portfolio without increasing volatility. This iterative process eventually reaches the efficient frontier -- analogous to standing atop a mountain where any direction you walk causes you to lose altitude.

### Required Inputs and Their Dangers

Optimization programs require estimates of expected returns, standard deviations, and cross-correlations for each asset class. Gibson's stern warning:

> "Garbage in, garbage out!"

Historical returns are particularly unreliable as inputs. For rolling 20-year periods ending 1979-1988, large company stocks barely outperformed Treasury bills by 2 percentage points -- clearly understating the true equity risk premium.

**Technical note**: The **simple average return** (not compound return) should be used as the expected return input, because the compound return already contains volatility information. Using compound returns would double-count volatility.

### Sensitivity Analysis: Small Changes, Radical Shifts

Five optimizations for the same client demonstrate alarming sensitivity:

- **Optimization 1** (unconstrained, 9 asset classes): Over half the portfolio goes to real estate -- driven by suspiciously low appraisal-based volatility statistics
- **Optimization 2** (removes real estate separate account): Treasury bills jump to 26.6%; large company stocks and international stocks are completely unrepresented
- **Optimization 3** (equity REIT return reduced by just 1%): REIT allocation plummets from 21.0% to 5.9%
- **Optimization 4** (equity REIT standard deviation increased by 1%): REIT drops from 21.0% to 13.0%
- **Optimization 5** (perfect REIT/small-cap correlation assumed): REIT jumps to 37.6% with complete elimination of small company stocks

Gibson's conclusion: attempting to specify inputs with greater precision is **futile**. Instead, constrain the optimizer.

### The Constrained Optimization Solution

By requiring minimum (5%) and maximum (25%) allocations for each asset class and a core 36% in corporate bonds/large company stocks, the constrained portfolio sacrificed only 0.4% in expected return with 0.6% more volatility -- but produced a **much more broadly diversified and sensible** allocation. Its diversification effect still reduced volatility by over 50% versus perfectly correlated assets.

### Hindsight Test: Inputs vs. Reality (1995-1998)

The optimizations used 1973-1994 data as inputs. The subsequent four years (1995-1998) revealed the danger: large company stocks -- completely excluded by the optimizer -- earned a 30.5% compound annual return, turning $1,000 into $2,900. Meanwhile, precious metals -- allocated 12% by the optimizer -- compounded losses at -17.40%. Computer programs cannot eliminate market uncertainty; they are **not reliable fortune tellers**.

### The Nonlinear Nature of Portfolio Improvement

The relationship between an asset class allocation and portfolio expected return is **nonlinear** -- steeply positive at first, then flat near the optimum. For example, if the optimal real estate allocation is 30%:

- Moving from 0% to 15% captures most of the improvement in portfolio expected return
- Moving from 15% to 30% produces a smaller additional gain
- The curve is relatively flat at and around the optimal point
- Beyond 30%, returns decline slowly at first, then faster

This has very important implications:

- It **removes anxiety about finding the exact optimal allocation** -- being close is nearly as good
- It means that despite wild swings in optimizer output from small input changes, the **actual portfolio performance differences may be modest**
- It justifies a **constrained approach** that sacrifices mathematical optimality for practical robustness
- It supports **limited market timing** within narrow bands around the strategic allocation, preserving most diversification benefits while allowing some active management

### Psychology and Precision

> Psychologically, it is easy to believe that a more precise answer is more certain. An advisor who recommends "exactly 19.3% in international stocks" may inspire more confidence than one who says "about 20%" -- even though there is no real difference.

Computer optimization programs give precise-looking outputs with color pie charts and probability estimates. All this technology can be seductive. Knowledgeable advisors will remember that **input variables are hard to specify with confidence** and that output is highly sensitive to small changes.

## Chapter 10: Know Your Client

> "The beginning is the most important part of the work." --Plato

### The 10-Step Money Management Process

Gibson lays out the money management process as an interactive loop:

- **Steps 1-2**: Know your client (gather data, identify needs/constraints)
- **Steps 3-6**: Manage client expectations (communicate philosophy, develop frame of reference, set objectives, determine diversification)
- **Steps 7-10**: Manage the money (allocate assets, write IPS, implement, report/revise)

The critical point: **money is not actually invested until Step 9**. Rushing through the first six steps is the most common and costly mistake.

### Step 1: Gather Client Data

The advisor should personally handle data gathering -- **psychological bonding begins here**. Key items:

- Organize assets into four classifications: interest-generating investments, equity investments, lifestyle assets, and liabilities
- The balance between investment and lifestyle assets indicates financial discipline
- Current portfolio composition reveals present volatility tolerance (a client with 90% in money markets is volatility-averse; one heavy in gold and rare coins has different attitudes)
- Watch for contradictions -- inherited stock positions carry psychological/emotional weight beyond financial analysis

### Step 2: Identify Needs, Constraints, and Circumstances

**Liquidity**: Non-liquid investments must be sized relative to possible future withdrawals.

**Portfolio cash withdrawal rate**: Portfolios should not be designed to intentionally produce a specific yield. The broad portfolio balance should reflect the time horizon, not income needs. If yield is insufficient for expenditures, the solution is periodic rebalancing with cash set-asides -- not distorting the allocation.

**Tax situation**: Determines municipal bond advisability, timing of asset sales, and IRA positioning strategies.

**Regulatory/legal constraints**: ERISA for retirement plans, trust instruments, IRA rules, restricted stock conditions.

**Time horizon**: The crucial variable. Clients systematically underestimate their time horizons by assuming retirement defines the endpoint. But inflation remains a threat throughout retirement, and a conservative posture requires planning beyond life expectancy. Institutional portfolios may have perpetual horizons.

**Psychological factors**: Client preferences should be accommodated when reasonable, but preferences based on misconceptions require education. The advisor's goal is to present new ideas in ways that facilitate acceptance.

### The Four Quadrants of Investment Worldview

Gibson's 2x2 matrix of worldviews, based on two questions -- "Is successful market timing possible?" and "Is superior security selection possible?" -- defines four distinct investment approaches:

**Quadrant 1** (Yes/Yes): Concentrate in the best asset class, pick the best securities. "Easy to sell, hard to deliver." The first time the advisor picks the wrong asset class, he has failed.

**Quadrant 2** (No/Yes): Diversify across asset classes but pick winning securities within each. The majority of professional money managers hold this view.

**Quadrant 3** (Yes/No): Time asset class moves but use index funds for implementation. The fewest proponents -- reserved for "market timing purists."

**Quadrant 4** (No/No): Markets are efficient. Diversify broadly using index funds. "Hard to sell, easy to deliver."

> Whereas quadrant 1 is "easy to sell, hard to deliver," quadrant 4 is "hard to sell, easy to deliver."

### The Trend Toward Quadrant 4

The more vigorously money managers compete to beat the market, the more quickly quadrant 4 becomes reality. Success invites imitation; as competitors replicate a winning strategy, its rewards trend downward. The professionals are not competing against unsophisticated investors -- they are competing against one another for the brass ring.

In an efficient market without transaction costs, trading is a **zero-sum game** (one investor's wins exactly offset another's losses). Add real-world costs and fees, and it becomes a **negative-sum game** -- participants expect to lose money by the mere act of playing, like slot machines (aptly called "one-arm bandits").

> The way to win a negative-sum game is not to play it.

Quadrant 4 investors strategically expect to win by **not playing**. They accept the asset class return as their upside and minimize costs through index funds. Whereas quadrants 1-3 investors *fight* market forces through skill, quadrant 4 investors *use* market forces.

> "If we think of the trend line of an asset class's growth path as the signal and the random fluctuations of security prices around that growth path as the noise, quadrant 1, 2, and 3 investors believe the key to investment success lies in the noise, whereas quadrant 4 investors believe it lies in the signal."

Gibson identifies a **conspiracy against the quadrant 4 worldview** among three co-conspirators:

- **Investors** don't want to accept that no one can protect them from harsh market realities
- **The money management profession** sees its existence threatened by a worldview that says skill cannot add value
- **The financial press** would have much less to write about

> "A cord of three strands is not easily broken." --Ecclesiastes

### Step 4: Develop a Frame of Reference

An advisor who educates clients about capital market behavior **empowers them to make wise decisions with greater equanimity**. Clients must understand that **there is no ideal investment** -- one that is simultaneously liquid, stable, and inflation-beating. Once that fantasy dissolves, clients grasp the necessity of compromise.

The constant they can rely on: **people will always prefer stability over unpredictability**, ensuring that volatile assets will always be priced to deliver higher expected returns. Without the uncertainty and volatility of common stocks, there would be no incremental payoff from equity investing.

### Step 5: Develop an Investment Objective

Gibson rejects traditional labels like "aggressive growth" or "growth and current income." He words objectives to **acknowledge the return/volatility trade-off**:

1. Low portfolio volatility with low total return
2. Medium total return with medium portfolio volatility
3. High total return with high portfolio volatility

Clients should be encouraged to choose a portfolio balance near the **upper end of their volatility-tolerance range** while ensuring they will remain committed through market extremes. The goal: maximize expected return subject to the client's need to **sleep well at night**.

### Step 6: Determine Breadth and Degree of Diversification

**Breadth** refers to which asset classes are included; **degree** refers to the relative allocation across them. Gibson designs three levels of equity diversification:

- **Limited**: 70% domestic stocks, with small allocations to international stocks, real estate, and commodities
- **Moderate**: More balanced allocation across all four equity asset classes
- **Greater**: 38% domestic stocks, with 62% spread across the other three classes

As diversification increases, frame-of-reference risk also increases -- the pattern of returns diverges further from the S&P 500. Clients must actively participate in this decision.

### Frame-of-Reference Risk

Gibson shows year-by-year comparisons of diversified portfolios versus the S&P 500. During 1973-74, the diversified portfolio lost only 7.63% in its worst year versus the S&P 500's -26.47%. But during 1995-98, the S&P 500's dominance made diversification feel painful. A Japanese investor would have been delighted with the exact same diversified results that frustrated American investors. **Same results, same time period -- different frame of reference.**

## Chapter 12: Money Management

> "Don't fight forces; use them." --R. Buckminster Fuller

### The Central Thesis

The tendency for most money managers to underperform the market underscores the value of **broadly diversified, multiple-asset-class investing**. The remarkable aspect: much of the improvement flows from the **simple policy decision to diversify** rather than from superior skill. Strategy should be grounded in realistic capital market expectations, not reliance on skill that is inherently difficult to identify.

### Step 7: Asset Allocation and Portfolio Design

Gibson organizes portfolios across seven asset classes: short-term debt, domestic bonds, international bonds, domestic stocks, international stocks, real estate investments, and investment hedges (commodity-linked securities, precious metals).

**Three model portfolios** for a $1 million portfolio:

| Component | Lower Volatility | Medium Volatility | Higher Volatility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Short-term debt | 55% | 20% | 10% |
| Longer-term bonds | 15% | 20% | 20% |
| Equity investments | 30% | 60% | 70% |

The author prefers handling volatility tolerance at the **broad portfolio balance level** rather than through security selection (e.g., low-beta vs. high-beta stocks). This approach builds directly from the decision framework, is easy for clients to understand, and permits broader diversification for all clients regardless of risk tolerance.

### Index Funds vs. Active Management

> "Investors as a group are the market and therefore cannot outperform the market." The attempt to beat the market through superior security selection comes with higher expenses that directly reduce realized returns.

**John C. Bogle**: "Indexers always win. In any financial market, indexers owning all securities at low cost must provide better returns than active investors in the aggregate, simply because the costs incurred by active investors are substantially higher."

### Step 8: The Investment Policy Statement

The IPS is the most important document in the fiduciary process. Its advantages:

1. Supports disciplined execution through extreme markets
2. Provides continuity for institutional committees as members rotate
3. Defends against Monday morning quarterbacking
4. Evidences proper fiduciary stewardship

**Litmus test**: An unfamiliar advisor should be able to implement the strategy from the IPS alone.

### Step 9: Implementation

**Dollar-cost averaging** is recommended for transitioning to a new portfolio. More volatile investments warrant longer transition periods (12-18 months for stocks, 6-12 for bonds). Benefits include both economic (more shares bought at lower prices) and psychological (gradual comfort with new volatility levels).

**IRA positioning strategy**: Design the target portfolio first, ignoring the IRA. Then place the investments generating the **highest taxable income per dollar invested** inside the IRA. Counterintuitively, this often means actively traded stock funds (with high capital gain distributions) go into the IRA, while index funds (with mostly unrealized appreciation) stay outside.

**Holistic portfolio management**: Always consider all assets including non-discretionary employer plans. A client with 40% of wealth in an employer plan invested entirely in short-term debt will need a much more aggressive allocation of discretionary funds to achieve the target overall balance.

### Step 10: Performance Reporting and Portfolio Revision

**Performance measurement challenges**: The typical quarterly reporting interval is far too short relative to investment time horizons. The S&P 500 is not a suitable benchmark for a diversified portfolio -- use a **weighted average of asset class index returns** instead.

**Passive rebalancing** (maintaining target allocations) is fundamentally different from buy-and-hold:

A buy-and-hold strategy has serious flaws:
- Equity commitment reaches its maximum just as bear markets begin
- Equity commitment is at its minimum as bull markets get underway
- Over time, higher equity returns create an increasing equity tilt, producing rising volatility exposure coupled with a shortening time horizon

**Passive rebalancing** avoids these problems:

1. Easy to understand and implement
2. Maintains constant portfolio volatility
3. Preserves balanced diversification
4. Inherently contrarian -- continually reallocates from recent outperformers to relative underperformers
5. Enforces discipline: sells stocks during bull markets, buys during bear markets

**Active approaches** include:
- **Dynamic asset allocation**: Sells as prices decline for downside protection, buys as prices advance -- characterized as "sell low, buy high"
- **Tactical asset allocation**: Attempts to "buy low, sell high" through economic scenario forecasting, dividend discount models, or business cycle analysis
- Gibson cautions that without superior predictive ability, active approaches easily underperform passive strategies. If used, minimum and maximum allocation limits should be maintained for each asset class

## Chapter 13: Resolving Problems Encountered During Implementation

### Client Inertia and Concentrated Positions

Clients equate familiarity with safety, creating resistance to change. Gibson presents a revealing advisor-client dialogue:

**Advisor**: "You have a very large percentage of your portfolio in XYZ stock."
**Client**: "Yes, I bought it at $10 per share and now it's worth $85. Why should I get off a winning horse?"
**Advisor**: "Assume you don't own the stock but have cash equal to its current value. Would you buy that much XYZ at $85 per share?"
**Client**: "No. I would never purchase a position that big at today's price!"

The long pause that follows reveals the client's anchor to historical cost. **Historical cost has nothing to do with whether a stock will continue to perform well** from its current price.

### The Paper Loss Syndrome

The same technique works for positions with large unrealized losses:

**Client**: "ABC stock has been rotten -- I bought it at $50 and it's now $8. But if I sell, I'll lose money."
**Advisor**: "You have already lost the money."
**Client**: "No, it's just a paper loss."
**Advisor**: "If you had cash equal to your position, would you buy ABC at $8 per share?"
**Client**: "No way. I can't wait to sell it -- as soon as it gets back to $50, I'm dumping it!"

What the client is really resisting is the **admission of having made an investment that did not work out**. Once sold at a loss, the verdict is unavoidable. But holding on preserves the hope of breaking even.

Gibson's overcoming technique: have the client hypothetically assume their **entire portfolio has been converted to cash** before designing the target portfolio. This frees the client from past decisions and allows all investment options to be evaluated on equal footing.

> Hold in your portfolio only those investments that you would actively repurchase if you did not already own them. Sell everything else.

### Tax Complications with Appreciated Assets

- Carry appreciated investments on the balance sheet at after-tax value to create awareness that taxes will eventually be due
- Consider the income yield impact: a stock bought at $10 now at $85 with a $3.60 dividend yields 4.2% on market value but after a 30% capital gains tax on sale, reinvested proceeds would need an 8% yield to match the income
- **Stepped-up tax basis** at death eliminates the capital gains tax entirely -- terminally ill investors should generally retain appreciated positions

### Total Return vs. Income Yield

Clients conditioned to "never spend your principal" may distort their portfolios toward bonds to meet income needs. Gibson shows that a properly balanced 50/50 bond/stock portfolio with 9% total return (4% yield + 5% appreciation) far outperforms a 100% bond portfolio with 6% total return (all yield) -- even though the stock portfolio requires small principal invasions to meet current expenses.

### Sustainable Withdrawal Rates

| Portfolio | Total Return | Less Inflation | Sustainable Withdrawal Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100% Bonds | 6% | 4% | 2% |
| 50/50 | 9% | 4% | 5% |
| 100% Stocks | 12% | 4% | 8% |

Even intentional full liquidation of principal barely helps: a $1 million CD portfolio at 5% yields $50,000/year in interest; systematic liquidation over 30 years only increases annual cash flow to approximately $65,000 -- useless against inflation that will triple the cost of living.

### Resistance to Specific Recommendations

When a client rejects a specific investment (e.g., an international stock fund), dig deeper. Often the real objection is not to the specific fund but to the **asset class itself** -- meaning a prior level of decision making was not properly resolved. The portfolio design process should proceed hierarchically: broad balance first, then asset allocation, then specific positions. Each level must be firmly established before proceeding to the next. If an objection surfaces at the wrong level, **withdraw the recommendation and return to the appropriate decision point**.

### Big Dollar Decisions

Investing large sums produces anxiety, especially for unsophisticated clients facing major decisions for the first time (lottery winners, inheritance recipients). Expressing recommendations as **percentages of total portfolio** helps: "3% of your $1 million portfolio in commodity-linked securities" sounds far less dramatic than "$30,000 in commodities."

## Conclusion

> "Money management is simple but not easy."

### Simple Because...

The principles are few and easy to understand. Two risks dominate: **inflation** and **volatility**. Avoiding one exposes you to the other. Time horizon determines which is more dangerous. Short horizons favor interest-generating investments; long horizons favor equities. Broad diversification benefits all clients regardless of volatility tolerance.

Because money management is simple, **every client can be meaningfully involved** in the decision-making process. Better education leads to better decisions, more realistic expectations, greater equanimity, and stronger commitment through market extremes.

### Not Easy Because...

Uncertainty cannot be eliminated. Gibson tells the **Mount Fuji story**: visitors who traveled four hours by bus to see the mountain arrived to find it shrouded in fog. No matter how carefully they focused their cameras, they could only get a sharper picture of the fog. "So it is with money management. All we can hope to accomplish is to get a better picture of the uncertainties -- we cannot eliminate them."

> "The window to the future is opaque."

As difficult as it is to live with, uncertainty is not necessarily bad. For the client with a long time horizon, volatility is rewarded by higher expected equity returns. There is a difference, though, between intellectually understanding something and living with it on a day-to-day basis. **Successful investing will always be as much a psychological process as a money management endeavor.**

### The Las Vegas Casino Analogy

Imagine standing amid slot machines in Las Vegas. All around you, jackpots are dropping coins noisily into metal trays. Although at any point some players are ahead, on average the flow of money runs from the players' pockets to the casino. In the midst of the magic, our excitement overrides judgment as we win just often enough to keep believing.

The day-to-day investment environment sends the same misleading signals: a new market-timing guru, an investment idea that seems superior to disciplined diversification. Rebalancing during bear markets feels dangerous; rebalancing during bull markets feels like a parent telling a child he has to leave a party just when everyone starts having fun. Without a **very firm commitment to long-term investment policies**, clients end up collecting portfolio positions the way they collect shells at the beach -- picking up whatever catches their eye at the moment.

### The Advisor's Role

Historically, the money manager's job was to enhance return through superior skill in security selection and market timing. Today, capital markets are highly efficient and **skill should not be relied on as the primary performance driver**. If future results will be determined primarily by asset allocation decisions, that is where advisors and clients must focus.

In a world trending toward efficient markets, the advisor's role shifts from security selector to **educator, architect, and general contractor**:

- **Educator**: Teaching clients the principles of capital markets so they make informed decisions
- **Architect**: Designing broadly diversified strategies in collaboration with clients
- **General contractor**: Implementing, monitoring, and providing perspective through extreme conditions

During extreme markets, clients need the **discipline and assurance of a steady hand** urging them to remain committed to their long-term strategies.

> Clients do not need sporadic investment suggestions. They need and will value the comprehensive management of their portfolios by knowledgeable investment professionals committed to their financial well-being.
