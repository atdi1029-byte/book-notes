# The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing — Detailed Chapter Notes

## Foreword (by John C. Bogle)

Bogle compares the Bogleheads to the American associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville in *Democracy in America* (1840) — voluntary groups of citizens combining for mutual benefit.

Two defining characteristics of Boglehead culture:
1. **Rationality** — common sense, intolerant of illogic, preference for facts over hyperbole. Popular investment misconceptions (short-term focus, chasing past performance, ignoring fees and taxes) are anathema.
2. **Caring** — eager to help all investors without compensation or bias. The Bogleheads forum embodies the Golden Rule.

> "Choose a sound financial lifestyle. Start early and invest regularly. Know what you're buying. Preserve your buying power. Keep costs and taxes low. Diversify your stock portfolio [and diversify your stock risk with a bond portfolio]." — John C. Bogle

Bogle draws parallels to Benjamin Franklin's *The Way to Wealth* (1757), noting that sound saving and investing principles are eternal:
- "If you would be wealthy, think of Saving as well as Getting."
- "Beware of little Expences; a small Leak will sink a great Ship."
- "For Age and Want, save while you may; no Morning Sun lasts a whole Day."

The Bogleheads' message is contrarian: common life principles (hire experts, you get what you pay for, past performance predicts future results) **fail** in investing. Understanding this is the first step toward investment success.

> "In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride." — Benjamin Franklin

## Introduction

> "Do not value money for any more nor any less than its worth; it is a good servant but a bad master." — Alexander Dumas fils, *Camille*, 1852

Bogleheads follow the investment philosophy of John C. "Jack" Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group. Key facts about Bogle:
- Created the first index fund for retail investors (initially mocked as "Bogle's Folly") — now the largest mutual fund in the world (Vanguard 500 Index)
- Named one of *Time* magazine's "100 Heroes and Icons Who Shape Our Lives" (2004)
- After stepping down as Vanguard chairman in 1996 (heart transplant), devoted his life to educating investors
- Key books: *Bogle on Mutual Funds*, *Common Sense on Mutual Funds*

The Bogleheads community began in 1998 on Morningstar's Vanguard Diehards message board, later moving to bogleheads.org. The forum gets 50,000+ visits and 1,500+ posts daily.

**Key topics covered in the book:**
- Getting on sound financial footing before investing
- Understanding investment types (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs)
- Protecting against inflation
- Determining how much to save
- Building simple, effective portfolios
- Saving for college, managing windfalls
- Choosing financial advisors
- Rebalancing portfolios
- Tuning out Wall Street noise
- Managing investor emotions
- Retirement income planning
- Insurance and estate planning

The authors (Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, Michael LeBoeuf) have combined 100+ years of investing experience. They have no hidden agendas — no financial planning business, no seminars to sell.

## Part I: Essentials of Successful Investing

---

## Chapter 1: Choose a Sound Financial Lifestyle

> "Drive-in banks were established so most of the cars today could see their real owners." — E. Joseph Grossman

**The stark reality:** Of 100 young Americans starting at age 25, by age 65 only one will be rich and four financially independent. The remaining 95 will be unable to self-sustain their lifestyle. Only 5% become financially independent by 65.

### Three Financial Lifestyles

**1. The Borrowers (Bill & Betty Borrower)**
- Live on credit cards, interest-only mortgages, leased cars
- "Forget about tomorrow, let's live for today"
- Pay only minimum balances on credit cards
- Take home-equity loans for vacations
- Building negative wealth (debt), not assets
- One job loss or illness away from financial ruin
- In Texas: "big hat, no cattle"

**2. The Consumers (Chad & Cathy Consumer)**
- Spend with a paycheck mentality — earn to spend
- Buying decision: "Can we afford the monthly payments?"
- Pass up 401(k) matching and Roth IRAs for immediate gratification
- Madison Avenue controls their wallet
- Without a cash cushion or long-term plan, a rented lifestyle that ends when work ends

**3. The Keepers (Ken & Kim Keeper)**
- Focus on **net worth**, not net income
- "Debt is deadly, and earning to spend gets you nowhere"
- First thing every paycheck: minimum 10% saved and invested off the top
- Eagerly participate in employer matching programs and max out Roth IRAs
- Buy 2-3 year old cars, pay credit cards in full monthly
- They enjoy life — nice home, fine restaurants, vacations — but with a long-term plan
- The Keepers will always have more than they need

### Three Steps Before You Start Investing

**1. Graduate from the Paycheck Mentality to the Net Worth Mentality**
- Society confuses income with wealth — they are separate measures
- *Income* = how much you earn; *Wealth* = how much you keep
- **Net worth** = total assets minus total debts
- Calculate it annually; it's the true measuring stick of financial independence
- Median U.S. family net worth (2010): $77,300
- College graduates: $195,200 median; Self-employed: $285,600 median

| Age | Median Net Worth |
|-----|-----------------|
| < 35 | $9,300 |
| 35–44 | $42,100 |
| 45–54 | $117,900 |
| 55–64 | $179,400 |
| 65–74 | $206,700 |
| 75+ | $216,800 |

**2. Pay Off Credit Card and High-Interest Debts**
- Paying off credit cards is the highest, risk-free, tax-free return you can earn
- Example: $8,000 balance at 18.9% with $160/mo minimum = 8 years to pay off, $7,000+ in interest = $15,000 for $8,000 of goods
- Credit card companies can raise rates to 25-30% for any missed payment
- No federal limit on credit card interest rates
- Paying off cards = guaranteed, tax-free return of 12-30%
- If balances are large, consider home-equity loan (lower rate, tax-deductible interest)

**3. Establish an Emergency Fund**
- Readily accessible cash for emergencies (accidents, job loss, illness, divorce)
- How much: depends on job stability — 3 months (very stable) to 12 months (self-employed)
- For most people: **6 months' living expenses**
- Keep in safe, liquid accounts: bank savings, credit union, money market funds

---

## Chapter 2: Start Early and Invest Regularly

> "Adding time to investing is like adding fertilizer to a garden: It makes everything grow." — Meg Green, CFP

**The power of starting early:** A Vanguard shareholder who invested since the mid-1970s grew his portfolio to $1,250,000 — never earning more than $25,000/year. How? $601/month in stock index funds at 10% average annual return for 30 years = $1,249,655. That's ~29% of a $25,000 salary.

### The Magic is in the Compounding

**Rule of 72:** Divide 72 by annual return to find how many years to double your money.
- 8% return → doubles every 9 years
- 12% return → doubles every 6 years
- Start with a penny, double daily → $5,338,709.12 on day 30

> Einstein called compound interest "the greatest mathematical discovery of all time."

**The cost of waiting — starting at age 25 vs. 35:**
- A 25-year-old investing $4,000/year in a Roth IRA at 8% for 40 years → **$1,119,124** (tax-free, from saving $11/day)
- Same person waiting until 35 → only $489,383

**Eric Early vs. Larry Lately:**
- Eric invests $4,000/year for 10 years (age 25-35), then stops. Total invested: $40,000
- Larry invests $4,000/year for 30 years (age 35-65). Total invested: $120,000
- At 8% return: Eric = $629,741; Larry = $489,383
- Eric invested one-third the money but ended with **29% more** because of a 10-year head start

**Amount needed as one-time investment at 8% to reach $1M by age 65:**

| Age | Investment Needed |
|-----|-----------------|
| 15 | $21,321 |
| 20 | $31,328 |
| 25 | $46,031 |
| 30 | $67,635 |
| 35 | $99,377 |
| 40 | $146,018 |
| 45 | $214,548 |
| 50 | $315,242 |
| 55 | $463,193 |
| 60 | $680,583 |

### Saving is the Key to Wealth

- The Boglehead approach is simple enough to teach your children
- The hardest part: acquiring the **habit of saving**
- Bogleheads are investors, not speculators. Investing = buying assets for the long term. Speculating = gambling for quick profits.

> "The problem with getting rich quick is you have to do it so often." — Jason Zweig

**Advice:** *When you earn a dollar, try to save a minimum of 20 cents.*
- Some save 50 cents of every dollar
- Reducing spending is more efficient than earning more (every dollar saved avoids ~$1.40 pre-tax earning needed)

**Research proof (Venti & Wise, NBER 2000):** "Choice, Chance and Wealth Dispersion at Retirement" studied thousands of households. The **only significant factor** determining wealth at retirement: **some people choose to save more than others.** Not health, luck, inheritance, or investment returns.

### Finding the Money to Invest

**Pay Yourself First:** Take savings off the top of every paycheck. Minimum 10%. If saving nothing now, start at 1% and increase by 1% per month — in a year you'll be saving 12%.

**Create a Tax-Free Fortune for $15/Day:** Cut $15/day in spending → ~$5,500/year into a Roth IRA. A 25-year-old doing this at 8% for 40 years → **$1,625,149** tax-free.

**Commit Future Pay Increases to Investing:** Channel at least half of all raises to investments. Maintain current lifestyle while building wealth.

**Shop for Used Items:** Buy used cars, furniture, clothes at fraction of cost.

**Don't Drive Yourself to the Poor House:**
- New mid-priced car costs ~$2,500/year more than a 3-year-old used car
- A 19-year-old buying used cars for life and investing the $2,500/year savings at 8% → **$1,129,750** by age 65
- Warren Buffett drives an old pickup truck; Bogle drives a 6-year-old Volvo

**Move Where the Cost of Living Is Cheaper:** Relocating from high-cost coastal areas can free up significant capital to invest. Newport Beach → Florida coastal city = 50%+ cost of living reduction. Boston → Phoenix = 41% lower.

**Create a Side Income:** Diversify income sources — side businesses, rental properties. Side income also insulates against layoffs. Beware of get-rich-quick seminars and network marketing scams.

> "When a man with experience meets a man with money, the man with money gets the experience, and the man with experience gets the money." — Old racetrack proverb

### Not All Debt Is Bad Debt
- Low-interest loans for homes, education, or starting a business = "good debt"
- Key: keep interest rates low, preferably tax-deductible, and borrow only when expected payoff > cost of borrowing
- Sometimes keeping a mortgage (e.g. 5% effective rate) while investing at 8% long-term = net gain of 3%/year, plus liquidity

### Chapter 2 Summary
> "What most young people don't understand is that SAVING is more important in the beginning than finding the best performing investment." — Eric Haban, Boglehead

The habit of saving, coupled with sound investment strategies, is what makes financial freedom a reality.

## Chapter 3: Know What You're Buying: Part One — Stocks and Bonds

> "Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years." — Warren Buffett

### Stocks
- Stocks = ownership interest in a corporation
- Stock value = what another buyer is willing to pay
- Returns come from: (1) dividends and (2) price appreciation
- Don't invest all funds in a single company — if it goes bankrupt, you lose everything

### Bonds
A bond = an IOU / promissory note that pays interest (usually semiannually) until maturity, when face value is returned.
- **Short-term:** 1 year or less
- **Intermediate-term:** 2–10 years
- **Long-term:** 10+ years
- Issuers: U.S. Treasury, government agencies, corporations, municipalities

#### Treasury Issues
- Safest bonds — backed by full faith and credit of U.S. government
- Interest exempt from state and local taxes
- **T-Bills:** 13, 26, 52-week maturities
- **T-Notes:** 2, 3, 5, 10-year maturities
- **T-Bonds:** 10+ year maturities
- **TIPS:** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities — protect against inflation

#### U.S. Savings Bonds (I Bonds & EE Bonds)
- 1-year minimum holding period; early redemption (before 5 years) = lose last 3 months' interest
- Tax-deferred for up to 30 years; exempt from state/local taxes
- Can be used tax-free for qualified educational expenses (must be registered in parent's name, not child's)
- EE Bonds (post May 2005): fixed rate, guaranteed to double in 20 years (minimum 3.526% yield)
- Buy via TreasuryDirect.gov

#### Government Agency Securities (Mortgage-Backed Securities)
- **GNMA (Ginnie Mae):** Full faith and credit of U.S. government; backed by FHA/VA mortgages
- **Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac:** "Implied" government backing only; slightly more risk = higher yields
- MBS values fluctuate with interest rates:
  - Rates rise → homeowners keep mortgages → lower-yielding GNMA securities lose value
  - Rates fall → homeowners refinance → early prepayment at lower yields

#### Corporate Bonds
Yield determined by: (1) creditworthiness, (2) comparable bond yields, (3) demand, (4) call features.
- **Credit ratings:** S&P: AAA (highest) → BBB (lowest investment grade). Below BBB- = "junk bonds" / "high-yield bonds"
- Higher credit rating → lower yield; lower rating → higher yield (compensation for risk)

#### Municipal Bonds
- Issued by state/local governments; normally free from federal tax, often also state tax
- Can be **triple tax-free** (federal + state + local) if issued by your city
- Worth considering in higher tax brackets (25%+)
- Some munis subject to AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)
- Municipal bond insurance guarantees only as good as the insurer's financial strength

### Maturity and Duration
- **Duration** measures bond/fund price sensitivity to interest rate changes
- Higher duration = more volatility
- Bond prices move **opposite** to interest rates (seesaw analogy)
- Example: 4.3-year duration → 1% rate increase = ~4.3% price decline
- If rates rise 1%, it takes approximately one duration period for increased yield to offset the price decline

### Selecting the Right Bond Fund
1. Match fund duration to your investment time horizon
2. Don't try to time interest rate hikes
3. Match fund to your risk tolerance (worried about losses → shorter duration)

### Why Invest in Bonds?
- Bonds have **low correlation** to stocks — stabilizing force in a portfolio
- 2008 bear market: equity funds lost 30-60%; Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund **gained** 5.05%

### How Much Should I Invest in Bonds?
- **Bogle's rule of thumb:** Hold your age in bonds (20-year-old = 20% bonds, 50-year-old = 50% bonds)
- More conservative → increase bond %; more aggressive → decrease bond %

### Individual Bonds vs. Bond Mutual Funds
**Individual bonds advantages:** Guaranteed principal return at maturity; no ongoing expenses
**Individual bonds disadvantages:** Broker commissions; larger minimums; can't reinvest dividends; hidden markups in secondary market

**Bond mutual funds advantages:** No-load; instant diversification; low minimums; automatic reinvestment; professional management
**Bond mutual funds disadvantages:** Ongoing expenses; no maturity date guarantee; manager can make mistakes

**Conclusion:** Hard to go wrong with a good quality, low-cost short- or intermediate-term bond fund.

## Chapter 4: Know What You're Buying: Part Two — Mutual Funds, Funds of Funds, Annuities, and ETFs

> "I've found that when the market's going down and you buy funds wisely, at some point in the future you will be happy." — Peter Lynch

### Mutual Funds
- Pool money from many investors to buy securities (stocks, bonds, money market instruments)
- Governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940
- Types of equity funds: aggressive growth, growth, growth & income, international, sector/specialty (REITs, health care)
- Bond fund maturities: short-term (1-4yr), intermediate (4-10yr), long-term (10yr+)
- **Balanced/hybrid funds:** Hold both stocks and bonds (common mix: 60/40)

### Mutual Fund Management Styles
**Indexing:** Replicates a benchmark (S&P 500, Wilshire 5000, etc.). Low cost.
**Active management:** Manager picks stocks/bonds hoping to beat the benchmark. Higher costs = higher hurdle to outperform.

Key problem: Very few active managers consistently outperform over the long haul. **Always read the fund's prospectus.**

**10 Advantages of Mutual Funds:**
1. Diversification — instant, affordable
2. Professional management
3. Low minimums ($50/month or $1,000-$3,000)
4. No-load options (no sales commissions)
5. Liquidity — redeem at NAV any trading day
6. Automatic reinvestment
7. Convenience — buy/sell online, phone, mail
8. Customer service
9. Record keeping and tax reporting
10. Variety — fund for virtually any need

### Funds of Funds
- Single fund that invests in multiple underlying funds — instant diversified portfolio
- **Vanguard LifeStrategy series:** 4 funds with different stock/bond ratios:
  - Growth: 80% stocks / 20% bonds
  - Moderate Growth: 60/40
  - Conservative Growth: 40/60
  - Income: 20/80
- Each invests in 4 Vanguard funds: Total Stock Market Index, Total Bond Market, Total International Stock Index, Total International Bond
- **Target-date / life-cycle funds:** Automatically become more conservative over time (e.g. Vanguard Target Retirement, Fidelity Freedom series). No need to rebalance yourself.

### Annuities
- Investment with an insurance wrapper
- Three types: fixed, variable, immediate

**Fixed Annuities:**
- Similar to bank CD but issued by insurance company
- Pays specific rate for specified period (1-5 years), then reverts to market rates
- Often use "teaser" high initial rates, then drop; "gotcha" surrender fees (10%+) can last 10+ years
- Your money is mingled with insurance company's operating funds — if they have problems, so do you
- Offers tax deferral even with after-tax money

**Variable Annuities:**
- Sub-accounts = clones of mutual funds with insurance wrapper
- Surrender fees often last many years
- Expenses dramatically higher: ~9,500 sub-accounts charge >2.5% annually; ~2,000 charge >3.0% — vs. Vanguard Total Stock Market Index at 0.17%
- Can switch between sub-accounts tax-free
- Money segregated from insurance company (safer than fixed annuities)
- **Never put a variable annuity inside a tax-deferred account** (401k, IRA) — "like wearing two raincoats when one will suffice"

**Immediate Annuities:**
- Lump sum → guaranteed income stream for life (or joint lives / specified period)
- You cannot outlive the income, even to age 100+
- No surrender charges, but you can't normally get your money back
- Payment guaranteed only by insurance company's financial strength — check safety ratings

**Bottom line on annuities:** Most are *sold*, not *bought*. High costs, surrender fees, and decreased tax benefits make them unsuitable for most investors. Always fund 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA before considering an annuity. If you must, use low-cost providers like Vanguard. Existing high-cost annuity? Consider a tax-free 1035 exchange to a low-cost provider.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
- Mutual funds that trade like stocks on an exchange throughout the day
- Often very low expense ratios (sometimes lower than equivalent index mutual funds)
- Track equity indexes, bond indexes; also some actively managed ETFs
- Priced continuously (vs. mutual funds priced once at market close)

**Downsides:**
- Broker commissions on each buy/sell (negates low cost advantage for dollar-cost averagers making frequent small purchases)
- Can trade at slight premium or discount to NAV
- **Not suited for frequent small purchases** — use index mutual funds instead

**Best for:** Large, one-time purchases held long-term. Vanguard offers commission-free ETFs.

**Warning:** Using ETFs for day trading or market timing will likely hurt returns.

### Chapter 4 Summary
Low-cost mutual funds should be the primary investment of choice for most investors.

## Chapter 5: Preserve Your Buying Power with Inflation-Protected Bonds

> "Control your destiny or somebody else will." — Jack Welch

**Inflation = a silent thief** that steals purchasing power. What matters is not the dollar *amount* but its *purchasing power*.

- 3% inflation over 40 years: $1,000 today → need $3,262 for same goods
- 4% inflation over 40 years: $1,000 → need $4,801

**Effects of Inflation (Table 5.1):**

| Period | Years | $1,000 in 1935 dollars needed |
|--------|-------|------|
| 1935–2005 | 70 | $14,255 |
| 1950–2005 | 55 | $8,103 |
| 1965–2005 | 40 | $6,200 |
| 1980–2005 | 25 | $2,370 |
| 1995–2005 | 10 | $1,281 |

Stocks are supposed to outpace inflation, but there have been periods when both small-cap and large-cap stocks (S&P 500) **failed** to outpace inflation. Even "ultrasafe" T-Bills and long-term government bonds have had periods of **negative real returns** (after inflation).

### I Bonds
- "I" stands for Inflation; U.S. Savings Bonds backed by full faith and credit of U.S. government
- **Risk-free** with guaranteed *real return* equal to the fixed rate at time of issue
- Yield = two components:
  1. **Fixed rate** (real return) — set at purchase, stays the same for 30 years
  2. **Variable inflation adjustment** — recalculated twice annually (May & November) based on CPI-U
- Example: 1.2% fixed + 3% inflation = 4.2% yield for first 6 months
- Before-tax return **guaranteed** to equal or exceed inflation
- Tax-deferred up to 30 years; exempt from state/local taxes
- **Strategy:** Cash in after retirement when in a lower tax bracket

**Caution with high tax brackets + high inflation + low fixed rates:** After-tax real returns can turn negative, especially in 33-35% brackets with only 1% fixed rate and 4% inflation. Higher fixed rate (1.5%+) and longer holding periods help.

**I Bond fixed rates have been declining:** From 3.4-3.6% in 1998-2000 to 0-0.2% by 2010-2014.

### TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
- Also U.S. Treasury-issued, inflation-protected
- Unlike I Bonds, TIPS rate set by marketplace at auction (not by Treasury)
- Three ways to invest: (1) buy at Treasury auction, (2) buy on secondary market, (3) TIPS mutual fund (e.g. Vanguard VIPSX, Fidelity FINPX)
- **Best location:** Tax-deferred accounts (IRA, 401k) — avoids "phantom income" tax issue
- If no room in tax-deferred accounts and spread between TIPS and I Bond fixed rates is large enough, TIPS in taxable account can slightly outperform

**TIPS phantom income problem:** You pay taxes on the inflation-adjusted principal increase each year, even though you don't receive that money until maturity. In high inflation years, you could owe more in taxes than interest received.

### I Bond vs. TIPS Summary
- For practical purposes, nearly a toss-up (differences <$50 per $1,000 over 10 years)
- I Bonds: more flexible (cash after 1 year), tax-deferred, Treasury sets rate
- TIPS: higher guaranteed rates, more investment options, best in tax-deferred accounts
- Both protect the future spending power of current dollars

## Chapter 6: How Much Do You Need to Save?

> "You really don't need to begin saving for retirement before you reach 60. At that point, simply save 250 percent of your income each year and you'll be able to retire comfortably at 70." — Jonathan Pond

### Nine Factors Determining Retirement Savings Needs
1. Amount you save
2. Current age (more time = more compounding)
3. Target retirement age
4. Years in retirement (life expectancy) — plan for 30 years
5. Whether you want to leave an estate
6. Expected rate of return on investments
7. Rate of inflation
8. Expected inheritance
9. Other income sources: pensions, Social Security, reverse mortgage, part-time work

### Retirement Age
Choose based on: when you have enough, when eligible for Social Security/pension, or simply when you enjoy your work enough to continue.

### Years in Retirement
Many investors plan for 25 years, but with increasing longevity, **plan for 30 years** — better to have too much than too little.

### Leaving an Estate
Priority #1: Take care of yourself and your spouse. Only plan a legacy after that's secure. One of the greatest gifts to your children: being financially independent in old age.

### Estimating Future Returns
Richard Ferri (Portfolio Solutions, LLC) estimated 30-year returns:

| Asset Class | Est. Total Return | Est. Real Return (after 2% inflation) |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| T-Bills | 2.1% | 0.1% |
| Intermediate Treasury Notes | 3.9% | 1.9% |
| Intermediate High-Grade Corporate Bonds | 4.6% | 2.6% |
| U.S. Large-Cap Stocks | 7.0% | 5.0% |
| U.S. Small-Cap Stocks | 7.3% | 5.3% |
| U.S. Small-Cap Value | 8.0% | 6.0% |
| REITs | 7.0% | 5.0% |
| International Developed Stocks | 7.4% | 5.4% |

**How to calculate portfolio expected return:** Multiply each asset class return by its portfolio weight, then sum. Example: 30% large-cap (7%) + 10% small-cap (7.3%) + 20% international (7.4%) + 10% REITs (7%) + 30% bonds (4.6%) = 6.39% expected total return.

**Reversion to the mean (RTM):** Asset classes that outperform for a period are likely to underperform in the next. Don't project recent high returns into the future.

**Inflation:** Long-term U.S. average (1914-2013): 3.22%. From 1964-2013: 4.18%. From 2004-2013: 2.47%. Account for it or you'll fall short.

**Inheritance:** Don't plan on it — it may disappear to long-term care costs. If it arrives, treat it as a windfall.

**Other Income:** Social Security, pensions, part-time work, reverse mortgages — all reduce the amount you need from your portfolio.

### Putting What We've Learned to Work

**Savings needed per $1,000 of annual retirement income** (at 3% inflation, 30 years of retirement):

| Years to Retirement | At 5% return | At 7% return | At 8% return |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 5 | $26,681 | $21,122 | $19,000 |
| 10 | $30,931 | $24,487 | $22,027 |
| 15 | $35,857 | $28,387 | $25,535 |
| 20 | $41,568 | $32,908 | $29,602 |
| 25 | $48,189 | $38,150 | $34,317 |
| 30 | $55,864 | $44,226 | $39,782 |

**Example:** 5 years from retirement, 7% return, need $30,000/year from portfolio → need ~$633,660 ($21,122 x 30). 30 years out at 8% needing $30,000/year → need ~$1,193,460 ($39,782 x 30).

Younger investors should be more aggressive (higher equity %, higher expected return), then become more conservative (more bonds) as retirement approaches. Revisit calculators periodically.

## Chapter 7: Keep It Simple — Make Index Funds the Core, or All, of Your Portfolio

> "Most of us have no chance of being as good as the average in any pursuit where others practice and hone skills for many, many hours. But we can be as good as the average investor in the stock market with no practice at all." — Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School

### How Investing Is Different from Most of Life

Common life principles that **fail** in investing:
- "Don't settle for average" → In investing, settling for the index **beats 80%** of pros
- "Listen to your gut" → Your gut is the worst investing advisor
- "Hire an expert" → You may get less than you pay for
- "You get what you pay for" → Higher-cost funds do NOT perform better
- "If there's a crisis, take action!" → Taking action in a market downturn is usually the worst move
- "History repeats itself" → Past performance does NOT predict future performance

**Dalbar study (1993-2012):** S&P 500 averaged 8.21%/year. The average equity fund investor earned only **4.25%** — nearly half — due to market timing and chasing hot funds. $10,000 at 8% for 20 years = $46,610 vs. $10,000 at 4.25% = $22,989.

**Long-term stock market:** Over any 50-year period in 200+ years of history, stocks have provided 5-7% real (after-inflation) return per year, roughly doubling purchasing power every 12 years. But short-term is random, unpredictable, and nerve-racking.

### Index Investing: It Pays to Be Lazy

Index investing outperforms ~80% of all investors. It requires no skill, no time, and no effort — your nest egg compounds on autopilot.

**The strategy:** Instead of picking stocks or chasing hot fund managers, just invest in index funds and forget about it. Index funds match the market return minus a tiny management fee.

### Why Indexing Is So Effective

**Seven advantages of index funds:**

1. **No sales commissions** — Load funds charge 4-6% upfront; index funds are no-load. Research shows load funds perform no better than no-load.

2. **Low operating expenses** — Active funds: 1-2% expense ratio. Index funds: under 0.5%, many at 0.2% or lower. **1% difference compounded over 20 years on $10,000 at 10% = $11,133 difference** ($49,725 at 1.5% expense vs. $60,858 at 0.5%).

3. **Tax efficiency** — Index funds have very low turnover, so fewer taxable capital gains distributions. Active funds create taxable events every time they sell profitable holdings.

4. **No need to hire a money manager** — Saves 0.75-3.0% per year in advisory fees. That money compounds for you instead.

5. **Higher diversification, less risk** — S&P 500 index = 500 stocks. Total Stock Market = entire U.S. equity market. Active fund risk (std dev): 19.4% vs. total stock market index: 16.2%.

6. **Doesn't matter who manages the fund** — S&P data shows active funds underperformed their index in all categories. Superstar managers (like Peter Lynch's 29%/year at Fidelity Magellan 1978-1990) are so rare that investment scholars attribute it to luck. Yesterday's stars are often today's underperformers.

7. **No style drift or tracking errors** — Active funds can drift from their stated style. Index funds always match their benchmark.

> "In school, it takes a lot of work to earn an A. In investing, if you know nothing and buy index funds, you have a 100 percent chance of being a B investor. In a world where most investors get a D or worse, B is beautiful."

### What the Experts Say About Indexing

> "Most investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees." — **Warren Buffett**

> "An index fund dooms you to mediocrity? Absolutely not: It virtually guarantees you superior performance." — **William Bernstein**

> "I love index funds." — **William F. Sharpe**, Nobel Laureate

> "The fund industry's dirty little secret: Most actively managed funds never do as well as their benchmark." — **Arthur Levitt**, former SEC chairman

> "Through the past 30 years more than two-thirds of professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the unmanaged S&P 500 Index." — **Burton Malkiel**, Princeton

### How to Buy Index Funds

- **Never** buy load index funds with high expense ratios
- Only consider no-load funds with expense ratios of **0.5% or less** — the cheaper the better
- Prefer index mutual funds over ETFs for regular investing (avoids commissions on each purchase)
- Recommended firms: Vanguard (preferred), Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, USAA, Charles Schwab, TIAA-CREF (min $50/month)

### Bogleheads and Actively Managed Funds

The authors aren't index-only zealots — all three own some actively managed Vanguard funds. Key points:
- If using active funds, stick to **low-cost** providers (Vanguard's average active expense ratio: 0.28%)
- Active funds can have great pre-tax but poor after-tax returns due to trading → keep them in tax-deferred accounts
- Place the bulk or all of your investments in index funds; active funds are a **greater risk** with accompanying possibility of greater return or loss

## Chapter 8: Asset Allocation — The Cornerstone of Successful Investing

> "The most fundamental decision of investing is the allocation of your assets: How much should you own in stocks? How much should you own in bonds? How much should you own in cash reserve?" — Jack Bogle

Asset allocation = dividing investments among different asset classes (baskets) to minimize risk and maximize return for an *efficient portfolio*.

Two key questions: (1) What investments? (2) What percentage to each?

### The Efficient Market Theory (EMT)

**History of EMT:**
- **1900 — Louis Bachelier:** French mathematician's PhD thesis planted the seeds — stock prices already incorporate all relevant information
- **1903-1929 — Alfred Cowles:** Reviewed 7,500 financial forecasts (1903-1929), conclusion: **"Can Stock Market Forecasters Forecast? It is doubtful."** In 1944, studied 6,904 more forecasts (1929-1943): found *no evidence of ability to predict market direction*
- **1960s — Eugene Fama** (U. of Chicago): Stock prices are very efficient; extremely difficult to pick winners after transaction costs
- **1973 — Burton Malkiel:** Published *A Random Walk Down Wall Street* — "short-run changes in stock prices cannot be predicted"

> "A random walk: a drunk standing in the middle of the road whose future movements can only be guessed."

Few academics claim the market is totally efficient, but they agree it's efficient enough that the majority of investors — including full-time professionals — will not outperform an unmanaged index fund after costs.

> "I know of no serious academic, professional money manager, trained security analyst, or intelligent individual investor who would disagree with the thrust of EMT: The stock market itself is a demanding taskmaster. It sets a high hurdle that few investors can leap." — Jack Bogle

*Efficient markets* and *random walk* are obscenities on Wall Street, where investors are constantly told that Wall Street's superior knowledge can make it easy to beat the market (for a fee). Nearly all the academic community disagrees, but without advertising dollars their research results are generally unknown by the investing public.

### Modern Portfolio Theory

**Harry Markowitz** is credited with being the father of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). He realized the importance of *risk* (standard deviation of expected return) and understood that risk and return are related. Key insight: **risk aversion** — given the same outcome, investors will always choose the investment with less risk.

> "There is no free lunch."

Markowitz's greatest contribution: a mixture of volatile noncorrelated securities could result in a *portfolio* with **lower volatility and possibly higher return**. Published in 1952 in the *Journal of Finance*. Received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1990.

### The Brinson, Hood, Beebower Study

In 1986, three researchers studied the performance of 91 large pension funds (1974-1983). They found pension fund returns came from four sources:
1. **Investment policy (asset allocation)** — allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash
2. Individual security selection
3. Market timing
4. Costs

**Result:** Asset allocation determined **93.6%** of the variability of pension plan returns. Active management cost the average fund a **1.10% reduction** in return vs. just buying and holding an index.

In 2003, Vanguard replicated this with 420 balanced mutual funds over 40 years: **77%** of return variability was determined by strategic asset allocation. Market timing and stock selection played minor roles. Benchmark indexes had higher returns than corresponding funds, and highest-cost funds lagged lowest-cost funds.

### Designing Our Personal Asset Allocation Plan

Four elements for an efficient portfolio:
1. **What are your goals?** — First home, college, retirement, or all three
2. **What is your time frame?** — Stocks unsuitable for <5 years
3. **What is your risk tolerance?** — Can you stomach bear markets?
4. **What is your personal financial situation?** — Pension, Social Security, net worth

**Table 8.1 — Annualized Returns of Large Domestic Stocks (1935-2013):**

| Time Period | Worst Return | Best Return |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 year | -43% | +54% |
| 5 years | -12% | +29% |
| 10 years | -1% | +20% |

Stocks are poor investments for short-term goals but excellent for long-term goals.

#### Risk Tolerance

Most investors are **more fearful of a loss than they are happy with a gain**. The NASDAQ dropped from 5,049 (March 2000) to 1,224 (October 2002) — a 75% loss. Twenty-two years later it was still far below its 1989 high.

**The sleep test:** "Can I sleep soundly without worrying about my investments with this particular asset allocation?" Adjust your stock/bond ratio until the answer is yes.

**If you haven't experienced a bear market yet**, add 10-20% more bonds than you think you need.

**Table 8.2 — Worst Annual Loss Based on Stock/Bond Allocation (1926-2012):**

| Allocation | Worst Annual Loss | Average Return |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 100% stocks | -43.1% | 10.0% |
| 80% stocks / 20% bonds | -34.9% | 9.4% |
| 60% stocks / 40% bonds | -26.6% | 8.7% |
| 40% stocks / 60% bonds | -18.4% | 7.8% |
| 20% stocks / 80% bonds | -10.1% | 6.7% |
| 100% bonds | -8.1% | 5.5% |

#### Personal Financial Situation

Your personal financial situation directly influences your asset allocation. Investors with pensions and Social Security don't need as large a portfolio. Those with significant net worth don't need risky investments for higher returns.

### Choosing Your Investments

Stick to stocks, bonds, and cash. Forget exotic securities (hedge funds, gold bullion, penny stocks, commodity futures).

> "Never buy anything whose price you can't follow in the newspapers — and you shouldn't buy anything too complex to explain to the average 12-year-old." — Jane Bryant Quinn

**Three guidelines for allocating:**
1. Bogle's rule: bonds should roughly equal your age
2. Table 8.2 shows the decline you might expect with various stock/bond combinations
3. Vanguard's online questionnaire and Appendix IV

*This is the most important portfolio decision you will make.*

Don't worry about exact percentages — 10% more or less of an asset class will not make a significant difference. *The only certainty in investing is that past performance will not repeat.*

### Subdividing Your Stock Allocation

Different types of stocks perform differently at different times. Use **Morningstar's Style Box** to analyze portfolio holdings across value/core/growth and large/medium/small.

**Table 8.3 — Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Breakdown (Feb 2014):**

| | Value | Core | Growth |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| **Large** | 24% | 24% | 25% |
| **Medium** | 6% | 6% | 6% |
| **Small** | 3% | 3% | 3% |

Many investors overweight value and small-cap stocks for potentially less volatility and higher long-term returns.

**Sector funds:** Limit to 10% of equity allocation. Jack Bogle: "You could go your entire life without ever owning a sector fund and probably never miss it."

**REITs:** Often behave differently than other stocks (noncorrelation). Worthwhile addition to larger portfolios. Limit to 10% of equity allocation.

**International Stocks:** U.S. stocks represent about half the value of world stocks. Foreign stocks offer diversification and possibly higher returns, but carry additional risks (political instability, weak regulation, currency risk). The Japanese Nikkei 225 hit 39,916 in 1989 and was still far below that level 22+ years later.

**Table 8.4 — Domestic vs. International Returns (1998-2013):**

| Year | Domestic | International | Best Performer |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 1998 | 28.6% | 20.0% | Domestic |
| 1999 | 21.0% | 27.0% | International |
| 2000 | -9.1% | -14.2% | Domestic |
| 2001 | -11.9% | -21.4% | Domestic |
| 2002 | -22.1% | -15.9% | International |
| 2003 | 28.7% | 38.6% | International |
| 2004 | 10.9% | 20.3% | International |
| 2005 | 4.9% | 13.5% | International |
| 2006 | 15.8% | 26.3% | International |
| 2007 | 5.5% | 11.2% | International |
| 2008 | -37.0% | -43.4% | Domestic |
| 2009 | 26.5% | 31.8% | International |
| 2010 | 15.0% | 7.7% | Domestic |
| 2011 | 2.1% | -12.1% | Domestic |
| 2012 | 16.0% | 17.3% | International |
| 2013 | 32.4% | 22.8% | Domestic |

Bogle recommends limiting international to **max 20% of equity** portfolio. The authors suggest **20-40%** of equity allocation.

### Subdividing Your Bond Allocation

**Bond Funds:** A single low-cost short- or intermediate-term bond fund is adequate for small investors. Recommended: Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX) — ~6,000 bonds, ~5-year duration, 0.20% expense ratio (0.10% Admiral). Worst annual loss since 1986: -2.7% (1994).

**High-Yield (Junk) Bonds — Not Recommended:**
1. Bonds should be for safety; junk bonds muddy the stock/bond distinction
2. Most tax-inefficient securities — crowd out other funds in tax-deferred accounts
3. For risk-seekers, stocks offer higher return per unit of risk
4. More closely correlated to stocks (Vanguard High-Yield fell -21.3% in 2008)

**TIPS:** Provide diversification and inflation protection. Vanguard offers intermediate (VIPSX, $3,000 min) and short-term (VTAPX, $10,000 min). VIPSX and VBMFX complement each other — when one is down, the other often gains.

**Table 8.5 — Comparison of Annual Returns: VBMFX vs. VIPSX (2001-2013):**

| Year | VBMFX | VIPSX |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2001 | 8.43% | 7.61% |
| 2002 | 8.26% | 16.61% |
| 2003 | 3.97% | 8.0% |
| 2004 | 4.24% | 8.27% |
| 2005 | 2.40% | 2.59% |
| 2006 | 4.27% | 0.43% |
| 2007 | 6.92% | 11.49% |
| 2008 | 5.05% | -2.85% |
| 2009 | 5.93% | 10.80% |
| 2010 | 6.42% | 6.17% |
| 2011 | 7.56% | 13.24% |
| 2012 | 4.05% | 6.78% |
| 2013 | -2.26% | -8.92% |

Note: 2001, 2002, and 2008 were bad bear-market years for stocks. Bonds helped smooth out the ride.

**Municipal Bonds:** For high-income taxpayers when tax-advantaged accounts are full.

### Portfolio Guidelines

Eight sample portfolios depending on life stage:

**Young Investor:**
- 55% domestic large-cap stocks, 25% domestic mid/small-cap, 20% intermediate bonds
- *Vanguard version:* 80% Total Stock Market Index / 20% Total Bond Market Index

**Middle-Aged Investor:**
- 30% large-cap, 15% small/mid-cap, 10% international, 5% REITs, 20% intermediate bonds, 20% inflation-protected securities

- 20% diversified domestic stocks, 40% short/intermediate bonds, 40% inflation-protected securities
- *Vanguard version:* 20% Total Stock Market / 40% Short-Term or Total Bond Market / 40% Inflation-Protected Securities

### What the Experts Say About Asset Allocation

> "Asset allocation is critically important; but cost is critically important, too — all other factors pale into insignificance." — **Jack Bogle**

> "The most important decision you will probably ever make concerns the balancing of asset categories (stocks, bonds, real estate, money market securities, etc.) at different stages of your life." — **Burton Malkiel**

> "Your portfolio mix of asset classes will be far more important in determining its performance than will your selection of individual securities or mutual funds." — **John Merrill**

---

## Chapter 9: Costs Matter — Keep Them Low

> "The shortest route to top quartile performance is to be in the bottom quartile of expenses." — Jack Bogle

Every dollar paid in commissions, fees, and expenses is one dollar less received from the investment. *It's critical that we keep our investment costs as low as possible.* Total costs in the U.S. equity market (not just mutual funds) are estimated at **$300 billion annually** — advisory fees, brokerage commissions, customer fees, legal fees, marketing, sales loads, transaction costs. Not including taxes.

### Fees Covered by the Prospectus

> "Death by a thousand fees isn't going to show up in a quarterly fund statement." — Stephen Schurr, TheStreet.com

**Sales Charge on Purchases (Front-End Loads):**
- 4-6% commission deducted from your investment upfront
- $10,000 invested with 5% load → only $9,500 actually invested
- Reported returns for load funds are overstated because they don't factor in the front-end load
- **Avoid load funds.** If you need financial advice, use a fee-only financial planner

**Deferred Sales Charge (Back-End Loads / CDSL):**
- Commission paid when you sell, typically declining over time (5% year 1 → 4% year 2 → ... → 0%)
- Funds with CDSL typically also charge annual 12b-1 fees (so the commission is *never* truly gone)

**No-Load Mutual Funds** charge no sales commission, but still have operating expenses:
- **Purchase fees:** ~1% to defray costs, paid to the fund (not a broker)
- **Exchange fees:** Charged when swapping between funds in same family; discourages market timing
- **Account fees:** Low-balance maintenance fees
- **Redemption fees:** Paid to the fund when selling; discourages short-term traders
- **Management fees:** Paid to fund's investment advisor for portfolio management
- **12b-1 fees:** Distribution/marketing expenses paid from fund assets. Controversial — hide deferred sales commissions. SEC allows funds with <0.25% 12b-1 fees to call themselves "no-load"
- **Other expenses:** Custodial, legal, accounting, transfer agent, administrative

**Total Annual Fund Operating Expense (Expense Ratio)** = management fees + 12b-1 fees + other expenses. Available from the fund company, Morningstar, and required in every prospectus.

**Always read the fund prospectus.**

### Fees Not Covered by the Prospectus

**Hidden Transaction Costs** (caused by fund *turnover*):
- Brokerage commissions, bid-offer spreads, market impact costs
- Can easily **exceed** the expense ratio

**Brokerage Commissions:** Average mutual fund commission = 0.38% of fund assets.

**Soft-Dollar Arrangements:** Brokers receive commissions for providing added benefits (research, travel, entertainment) to fund managers — costs that should be in the expense ratio but aren't.

**Spread Costs:** Bid-ask spread averages 0.34% annually (only 0.06% for index funds).

**Market Impact Costs:** Large block trades force managers to buy at higher prices or sell at lower prices. A $500M fund with 80-100% turnover could lose **3-5% per year** to market impact costs alone.

**Turnover:** Amount of buying/selling in a year. 100% turnover = every stock bought and sold within 12 months. Higher turnover = higher costs and taxes. Low-turnover funds consistently outperform high-turnover funds.

**Wrap Fees:** Brokerage firm charges 2%+ on top of underlying fund expenses for "private money management." Paying twice for professional management. **Avoid the wrap.**

### Adding It All Together

**Total Annual Costs of Average U.S. Equity Mutual Fund:**

| Cost Component | % of Average Assets |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Advisory fees | 1.1% |
| Other operating expenses | 0.5% |
| **Total Expense Ratio** | **1.6%** |
| Transaction costs | 0.7% |
| Opportunity cost | 0.4% |
| Sales charges | 0.6% |
| **Total Annual Cost** | **3.3%** |

Historical compound annual return for U.S. stocks (1926-2004): 10.5%. After 3.3% in costs, average shareholder got only **7.2%** — the mutual fund industry took nearly **one-third** of the return.

**Devastating example:** Tad, age 25, invests $3,500/year for 40 years.
- At 10.5% (market return): **$1,961,795**
- At 7.2% (after costs): **$788,745** — *less than half*
- Annual income at retirement: $205,988 vs. $56,790 — *less than one-third*

### Taking Advantage of Lower Costs

Use index funds with low cost and low turnover. Vanguard's average expense ratio in 2012: **0.19%** — *one-sixth* the industry average of 1.11%.

### Low Cost as a Predictor

**Financial Research Corporation** studied 11 common predictors of future mutual fund performance (Morningstar ratings, past performance, expenses, turnover, manager tenure, alpha, beta, SD, Sharpe ratio). Conclusion: *The expense ratio is the only reliable predictor of future mutual fund performance.*

**Standard & Poor's study** (reported in *Kiplinger*, Sept 2003): In 8 of 9 Morningstar style-box categories, lower-cost funds beat higher-cost funds over 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods.

> "The deadliest sin of all is the high cost of owning some mutual funds. What might seem to be low fees, expressed in tenths of 1 percent, can easily cost an investor tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime." — **Arthur Levitt**, former SEC chairman

> "The only factor reliably linked to future mutual fund performance is the expense ratio charged by the fund." — **Burton Malkiel**

---

## Chapter 10: Taxes: Part One — Mutual Fund Taxation

> "The profound impact of taxes on fund returns is a subject too long ignored." — Jack Bogle

> "For all long-term investors, there is only one objective — maximum total return after taxes." — Sir John Templeton

### The Devastating Impact of Taxes

**Charles Schwab study (1963-1992):** $1.00 invested in U.S. stocks grew to:
- **$21.89** in a tax-deferred account
- **$9.87** in a taxable account — *less than half*

**Bogle (15-year study ending March 2009):** Average equity mutual fund: 5.4% pre-tax, 3.7% after-tax (1.7% annual tax drag). Vanguard S&P 500 Index: 6.7% pre-tax, 6.1% after-tax.

**Gerstein Fisher Research (15-year study ending June 2013):** Tax drag ranged from 0.70-1.20% per year for active funds and 0.51% for passive funds.

### How Mutual Funds Are Taxed

Two sources of mutual fund income subject to tax: **dividends** and **capital gains**.

**Stock Dividends:**
- Since 1926, dividends accounted for ~35% of total stock return
- "Qualified" dividends taxed at preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on bracket) — far lower than ordinary income tax rates
- Bond dividends taxed at ordinary income rates (up to 39.6%)
- **Tax-savvy investors:** stocks in taxable accounts, bonds in tax-deferred accounts

**Capital Gains:**
- *Realized:* Gains from securities the fund manager has sold; passed to shareholders on 1099-DIV
- *Unrealized:* Gains on securities still held — check before buying a fund (especially in taxable accounts)
- **Short-term** (held ≤12 months): taxed at ordinary income rate (highest bracket)
- **Long-term** (held >12 months): taxed at max 15% — *approximately half*

**Key tax lesson:** Hold mutual funds for *more than 12 months* to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rate.

### Turnover and Taxes

Low turnover → fewer realized capital gains → lower taxes. For maximum tax efficiency in taxable accounts:
- Favor funds with low dividends
- Favor funds with "qualified" dividends
- Favor funds with low turnover
- Favor tax-efficient index funds and tax-managed funds

### Investing in Taxable Accounts

**Tax Efficiency Ranking (Most → Least Efficient):**
1. Low-yielding cash, money market
2. Tax-managed stock funds
3. Total-market stock index funds
4. Mid-cap and small-cap index funds
5. Active stock funds
6. Balanced funds
7. Taxable bond funds
8. REIT funds
9. High-yield bond funds

Use Morningstar's **Tax-Cost Ratio** (longest period available) to evaluate fund tax efficiency. Use only long-term holdings in taxable accounts — avoid selling or exchanging profitable funds.

**Fidelity Magellan cautionary tale:** Once the world's best-performing fund; by Dec 2013 its 10-year annualized after-tax return was 4.0% (bottom 2% of category), vs. Vanguard S&P 500 at 7.29% after-tax (top 22%).

### How Tax-Managed Funds Save Taxes

Tax-managed funds use several techniques:
- **Low turnover** (index-oriented approach)
- **HIFO (highest-in, first-out) accounting** — sell highest-cost shares first to minimize gains
- **Tax-loss harvesting** — sell losing stocks to offset gains
- **Selecting low-dividend paying stocks**
- **Holding securities for long-term gains** (>12 months)
- **Redemption fees** to discourage short-term selling

### Tax-Manage Your Own Portfolio

Strategies you can use:
- **Keep turnover low** — buy funds to hold "forever"
- **Use only tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts** — low-turnover index and tax-managed funds
- **Avoid short-term gains** — hold >12 months before selling
- **Buy fund shares after the distribution date** — avoid paying tax on distributions earned before you owned the fund
- **Sell profitable shares after the new year** — delay tax reporting by a year
- **Harvest tax losses** — sell losing funds to offset gains and reduce income

### Tax-Loss Harvesting Example

You have a $2,000 gain and a fund with $6,000 loss:
1. Sell the losing fund before year-end
2. Use $2,000 loss to offset the $2,000 gain (tax-free)
3. Use $3,000 to reduce ordinary income (max allowed per year)
4. Carry forward remaining $1,000 loss to next year

**Wash sale rule:** Must wait 31 days before repurchasing the same fund. Can buy a *similar but not identical* fund during the interim.

### Bonds in Your Taxable Account

**Municipal bond funds:** Invest in federal tax-exempt bonds. Single-state muni funds can be exempt from federal *and* state taxes. Worth considering for higher-income taxpayers.

**Tax-equivalent yield formula:** Divide muni yield by (1 - your tax rate). Example: 5.75% muni / 0.72 (28% bracket) = 7.99% equivalent taxable yield.

**U.S. Savings Bonds (I Bonds & EE Bonds):** Interest exempt from state/local taxes; federal tax can be deferred up to 30 years. Can be tax-free if used for qualified education expenses.

## Chapter 11: Taxes: Part Two — Managing Your Portfolio for Maximum Tax Efficiency

> "Of all the expenses investors pay, taxes have the potential for taking the biggest bite out of total returns." — The Vanguard Group

### Use Tax-Sheltered Accounts

IRS tax-favored retirement plans (401(k), 403(b), IRA, etc.) are the best way to minimize taxes. IRS Publication 590 contains IRA instructions.

**401(k) Plans:**
- Pretax contributions (contribution limit: $17,500; $23,000 with catch-up for age 50+)
- Not reported as income on W-2 or tax return
- Benefits: automatic withholding, flexibility, employer matching, portability (rollover to IRA), creditor protection, hardship loans
- Disadvantages: high admin/investment costs, poor fund options, capital gains converted to ordinary income, restricted access
- **Four fee categories:** plan administration fees, investment fees, individual service fees, sales commissions
- If your 401(k) has poor options: (1) invest up to company match, (2) max out IRA, (3) contribute remaining to 401(k), (4) overflow into tax-efficient taxable funds

**403(b) Plans:**
- For nonprofits (schools, universities, churches, charities)
- ~80% of $578 billion held in annuities (expensive)
- Same contribution limits as 401(k)
- Major disadvantage: most only offer high-cost annuities
- If options are limited, look for a "90-24 transfer" escape hatch to move money to Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, or Vanguard

### Individual Retirement Account (IRA)

**Traditional IRA:**
- Contributions may be tax-deductible
- Earnings grow tax-deferred until distributed
- Max contribution: $5,500 ($6,500 with catch-up for 50+)
- 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59½ (exceptions: medical expenses >7.5% AGI, disability, death, annuity-type payments, higher education, first home up to $20,000)
- **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** starting at age 70½

**Nondeductible Traditional IRAs:** Not recommended — turn capital gains into higher-taxed ordinary income, require Form 8606 tracking, and complicate Roth conversions.

**Back-Door Roth:** For high-income earners: contribute to a nondeductible traditional IRA, then immediately convert to Roth. Works best if you have no existing traditional IRA balance.

### Roth IRAs

Contributions are *not* tax-deductible, but withdrawals are **tax-free**.

**Factors Favoring Traditional IRA:**
- Income too high for Roth
- Expect lower income/tax rate in retirement
- Need the tax deduction now
- May provide better creditor protection

**Factors Favoring Roth IRA:**
- Expect higher future tax rate
- Roth savings are worth more (after-tax dollars)
- No penalty on withdrawing *contributions*
- Withdrawals don't affect Social Security taxation
- **No RMDs** — can grow tax-free indefinitely
- Can contribute at any age
- Heirs pay no income tax on proceeds

**Table 11.1 — Traditional vs. Roth IRA Key Differences:**

| Feature | Traditional IRA | Roth IRA |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Age limit to contribute | Must be under 70½ | No age limit |
| Contributions deductible? | May be | Never |
| RMDs required? | Yes, at 70½ | No |
| Distributions taxed? | Yes, as ordinary income | No (if qualified) |

### IRA Conversions

Convert traditional → Roth when:
1. You no longer need the tax deductions
2. You expect tax rates to rise
3. You're in a period of low income (job loss, sabbatical, early retirement before Social Security) — convert up to the top of your current bracket

### Placing Funds for Maximum After-Tax Return

**The rule:** Place your most tax-*in*efficient funds in tax-deferred accounts; put tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts.

**Asset Placement Order (Least → Most Tax-Efficient):**
1. High-yield bonds (least efficient — put in tax-deferred)
2. International bonds
3. Taxable domestic bonds
4. TIPS
5. REITs
6. Balanced funds
7. Stock-trading accounts
8. Small-value stocks
9. Small-cap stocks
10. Large-value stocks
11. International stocks
12. Large-growth stocks
13. Most stock index funds
14. Tax-managed funds
15. EE and I bonds
16. Tax-exempt (muni) bonds (most efficient — put in taxable)

**Fund Placement Impact Example ($100,000 portfolio, 30 years):**
- Correct placement (stocks in taxable, bonds in tax-deferred): **$1,005,451** after-tax
- Wrong placement (bonds in taxable, stocks in tax-deferred): **$886,430** after-tax
- **Difference: $119,021** — just from putting funds in the right accounts

### 14 Tax-Savvy Ideas

1. Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), 403(b), IRAs, 529 plans)
2. Buy fund shares *after* the distribution date
3. Place tax-inefficient funds in retirement accounts, tax-efficient in taxable
4. Use tax-managed or tax-efficient index funds in taxable accounts
5. Avoid balanced funds in taxable accounts
6. Keep taxable fund turnover low
7. Avoid short-term gains — hold >12 months
8. Sell losing shares *before* year-end (tax-loss harvest)
9. Sell profitable shares *after* the new year (delay tax)
10. Determine best tax-basis method before selling
11. Consider municipal bonds and U.S. Savings Bonds for taxable accounts
12. During low-income years, convert to Roth
13. Donate appreciated securities to charities (avoid capital gains tax)
14. Appreciated holdings in taxable accounts are capital gains and income tax free if left to heirs (stepped-up basis)

## Chapter 12: Diversification

> "Diversification is a protection against ignorance." — Warren Buffett

### Why Diversify?

WorldCom, Enron, and many dot-com companies destroyed employees who had most of their retirement in company stock. They lost both their jobs and their savings. **Diversify your portfolio!**

Diversification offers two benefits:
1. **Reduces risk** — avoids "all eggs in one basket"
2. **Can increase return** — noncorrelated investments smooth out volatility

### Correlation

- **Correlation coefficient** ranges from +1.0 (perfect positive) to -1.0 (perfect negative)
- Investments that zig when others zag provide the best diversification
- In practice, most investments fall between 0 and 1.0
- **R-squared** measures how closely two investments track each other

**Table 12.1 — Correlation to Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index:**

| Fund | R-squared |
|------|----------|
| Vanguard 500 Index (VFINX) | 1.00 |
| Vanguard Growth and Income (VQNPX) | 0.99 |
| Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTSMX) | 1.00 |

Owning multiple funds with R-squared near 1.0 provides *no additional diversification*.

> "Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market." — William Bernstein

### How to Diversify

- **Simplest approach:** Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX) — own nearly the entire U.S. market for $3,000 minimum
- Add international stock funds, bond funds of various types
- **Low R-squared funds** offer the most diversification benefit (REITs at 0.12, Total Bond Market at 0.10, Precious Metals at 0.07)
- Low correlation doesn't mean suitable — Precious Metals & Mining is very volatile despite low correlation
- Use Vanguard Target Retirement funds for automatic diversification

> "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." is the Bogleheads' cardinal rule of investing

## Chapter 13: Performance Chasing and Market Timing Are Hazardous to Your Wealth

> "Don't gamble; take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don't go up, don't buy it." — Will Rogers

### Past Performance Does Not Predict Future Performance

**75% of mutual fund investors** mistakenly use short-term past performance as their primary reason for buying a fund. The financial media constantly churns out stories about recent winners — "hot fund of the month" — with cherry-picked figures over favorable periods.

**Morningstar stars are not predictive:** Mark Hulbert (*Forbes*, Feb 2004): "Over the past decade, Morningstar's five-star equity funds have earned an average 5.7 percent against a 10.3 percent return for the Wilshire 5000." University of Amsterdam study (2007): "The predictive performances of the different rating systems used by Morningstar do not beat a random walk."

**Key studies proving past performance doesn't persist:**
- **Mark Carhart** (*Journal of Finance*, 1997): "Individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers."
- **Barksdale & Green:** Portfolios finishing in the top quintile over 5 years were the *least* likely to finish in the top half over the next 5 years
- **Barra:** "There is no evidence of persistence of equity fund performance."
- **Vanguard:** Of the top-20 equity funds (1983-1993), only *one* stayed in the top 100 in the subsequent 10 years

**Table 13.1 — Best & Worst Asset Classes (1994-2004):** Every asset class (except large caps) was both the best *and* worst performer during this period. Today's winner is tomorrow's loser.

**Cautionary tales:**
- *44 Wall Street Fund:* Top performer in 1970s → worst performer in 1980s
- Since the 1960s, average return of top-20 funds each decade was *less than* the market index the next decade
- Of top 50 funds in 2000, *not one* appeared on the top-50 list in 1999 or 1998
- *Grand Prix Fund:* Top 1% in 1998-99 → bottom 1% in 2000-01

> *Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.* Believe it!

### Market Timing

> "A strategy based on predicting short-term price changes in securities, which is virtually impossible to do." — Motley Fool

It's futile to pick winning funds based on past returns, and equally futile to time the market.

### Financial Newsletters

**Graham & Harvey study:** Tracked 15,000+ market-timing predictions by 237 newsletter writers (1980-1992). Conclusion: *"There is no evidence that newsletters can time the market."* By the end of the study, **94%** of the newsletters had gone out of business.

**Mark Hulbert:** A hypothetical portfolio of each year's top-performing newsletter (1981-2003) produced a second-year average annualized *loss* of **32.2%**, vs. the Wilshire 5000's *gain* of 13.1%.

**The Granville Market Letter:** 245% return in 1991 → 84% *loss* in 1992. Investor who put in $10,000: ended with $3,920 — a **61% net loss**.

**Doug Fabian:** Publicly invested $500,000 using his market timing system. Lost $192,000.

**Elaine Garzarelli:** Correctly called the 1987 crash → promoted to chief strategist → series of bad calls → fired → started newsletter → more bad calls → newsletter quietly disappeared.

> "The idea that a bell rings to signal when investors should get into or out of the stock market is simply not credible. After nearly 50 years in this business, I do not know of anybody who has done it successfully and consistently." — Jack Bogle

### Financial Shows on TV

CNBC and financial TV are "a cleverly disguised marketing pitch for the product or service recommended." We cannot remember ever hearing a TV guest "expert" say "I don't know."

### Wall $treet Week

Lou Rukeyser's 10 market-timing "Elves" were consistently wrong — bullish at tops, bearish at bottoms. Rukeyser replaced five bearish Elves with bullish ones just before a three-year bear market. All 10 were still bullish when dismissed on Sept 14, 2001.

Expert stock picks tracked over 10 years: average return 8.0% vs. market index 9.5%. That 1.5% difference compounded: $10,000 over 35 years → $147,900 (expert picks) vs. $239,600 (index).

### Financial Magazines

Jack Bogle studied *Forbes* "Honor Roll" funds (1974-1992): $10,000 invested grew to $75,000. Same amount in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index: **$103,600**.

Magazine cover story investment recommendations consistently underperform the market. "Unfortunately, rational, pro-index-fund stories don't sell magazines."

### The Bogleheads Contest

Taylor Larimore's annual market-forecasting contest demonstrated the futility of prediction:
- **2001:** 99 Bogleheads predicted 6.0% *gain*. Market fell 18%.
- **2002:** 75% predicted a *gain*. S&P fell 23%. Only 1 of 11 Wall Street strategists correctly predicted the market *direction*.

**Table 13.3 — Wall Street Experts' 2002 S&P 500 Predictions:** All 11 major firms predicted gains (950-1570). Actual year-end: **880**.

### Predicting Interest Rates

> "If you think successfully timing the stock market is difficult — and it is — the bond market is virtually impossible." — Mark Hulbert

Expert economists have been right about interest rate *direction* only about **one-third** of the time (1982-2006). Of 33 bond newsletter editors, only 2 outperformed the index.

> "There are only two kinds of interest-rate forecasters: those who don't know, and those who don't know that they don't know." — John Kenneth Galbraith

### Stay the Course

**Table 13.4 — Buy-and-Hold vs. Active Trading (Odean & Barber, UC study of 66,400 investors, 1991-1997):**

| Strategy | Turnover | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Most Active Trader | 258% | 11.4% |
| Average Trader | 76% | 16.4% |
| Buy and Hold | 2% | **18.5%** |

Buy-and-hold investors outperformed the most active traders by **7.1% per year**.

> "Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior." — Warren Buffett

> "Stay-the-course. I've said it a thousand times and I meant it every time. It is the most important single piece of investment wisdom I can give to you." — Jack Bogle

> "Buy and hold is a very dull strategy. It has only one little advantage — it works, very profitably and very consistently." — Frank Armstrong

## Chapter 14: Savvy Ways to Invest for College

> "Economists report that a college education adds many thousands of dollars to a man's lifetime income — which he then spends sending his son to college." — Bill Vaughan

### The Value of Education

**Table 14.1 — Expected Lifetime Earnings by Education Level:**

| Education Level | Lifetime Earnings |
|----------------|------------------|
| Some high school, no diploma | $1,000,000 |
| High school diploma | $1,200,000 |
| Some college, no degree | $1,500,000 |
| Associate degree | $1,600,000 |
| Bachelor's degree | $2,100,000 |
| Master's degree | $2,500,000 |
| Doctoral degree | $3,400,000 |
| Professional degree | $4,400,000 |

A bachelor's degree adds ~$1,000,000 in lifetime earnings — an increase of $200,000+ per year of college. What really matters is *going to college and graduating with a well-chosen major*, not necessarily attending an expensive private school.

### Methods of Saving for College

**1. Personal Savings in Parents' Names:**
- Most flexible; no income limits or restrictions
- After-tax dollars; long-term capital gains rates on equity sales
- Money not earmarked — can redirect if not needed for college
- Financial aid formula: only 5.6% of parent assets counted vs. 35% for child assets

**2. Custodial Accounts (UTMA/UGMA):**
- Child gains full control at age 18-21
- Counted as child's asset (35% hit to financial aid)
- Not recommended for college savings

**3. U.S. Savings Bonds:**
- Tax-free if used for qualified education expenses
- **Must** be titled in parent's name (not child's)
- Buyer must be 24+ when purchased
- If income limits exceeded, transfer proceeds to a 529 Plan tax-free

**4. Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA):**
- $2,000/year per student (after-tax); tax-free growth
- Broad qualifying expenses: K-12, college, books, room & board, computers, tutoring
- Can even fund contributions to a 529 Plan
- Contributions cannot be made once child turns 18; funds must be used by age 30
- Remaining funds can be transferred to another family member under 30
- Despite the low $2,000/year limit, may still be the best choice for your first $2,000 of education savings

**5. 529 Qualified Tuition Plans (QTP):**
- Two types: **education savings plans** and **prepaid tuition plans**
- Buy direct to avoid broker commissions — no reason to pay a middleman
- Every state offers a 529 plan with its own rules; you don't have to use your own state's plan
- Some states offer tax breaks to residents who invest in their state's plan
- Investment choices are limited to those offered by the plan; many are age-based (automatically get more conservative as child nears college)
- Allow substantial contributions — an individual can contribute 5x the annual gift tax limit as a single lump sum (treated as 5 annual gifts); couples can do 10x
- Some states allow total balances up to $300,000 per individual
- Earnings grow tax-deferred; withdrawals for qualifying education expenses are tax-free
- No income limits; you retain complete control of assets (unlike UTMA/UGMA)
- Can change beneficiary to another family member
- **Prepaid tuition plans** lock in today's tuition prices at a state university — but if child attends private/out-of-state school, the rate of return may be much lower than an education savings plan

**6. IRA Withdrawals:**
- You can withdraw from your IRA for qualifying educational expenses without the 10% early withdrawal penalty (even under age 59½)
- A Roth IRA can serve as a college-funding vehicle
- However, unless you have more-than-adequate retirement assets, don't raid your retirement funds for education — "You can borrow for college, but you can't borrow for retirement"

**7. Other Options:**
- Employer-paid tuition plans, scholarships, loans, Federal Pell grants, work-study programs
- IRS offers Hope Scholarship Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit
- Community college for first two years can be a lower-cost option with guaranteed transfer admission to four-year schools

### Summary of College Savings Plans

No single plan is ideal for everyone. Read IRS Publication 970 (Tax Benefits for Education) for comprehensive, free information. Tax laws change constantly — stay current. Joseph Hurley's *The Best Way to Save for College* is a recommended resource.

## Chapter 15: How to Manage a Windfall Successfully

> "If only God would give me some sign ... a clear sign! Like making a large deposit in my name at a Swiss bank." — Woody Allen

A windfall is coming into a large sum of money in a very short time. Over the course of a lifetime, it will probably happen at least once. **More than 75% of windfalls are squandered.** NBC News reported 70%+ of lottery winners exhaust their fortunes within three years.

Common sources of windfalls: inheritance, divorce settlement, lawsuit settlement, widowhood, insurance settlement, real estate sale, stock options, large bonus, business sale/growth, new high-paying job, retirement lump sum.

### Windfalls Are About a Whole Lot More Than Money

Money is a power symbol — freedom, possessions, status, access, experiences. A sudden influx triggers emotions ranging from ecstasy to depression. It's common for windfall recipients to feel inadequate, stressed, and paranoid.

**Four steps to manage a windfall:**

**1. Deposit the Money and Leave It for Six Months**
- Emotions are temporary and usually subside within six months
- Exceptions: take 1-2% to celebrate, pay off high-interest debts, pay any taxes due
- Resist all temptations: don't invest in "can't miss" pitches, don't lend to friends/family, don't buy luxury items to impress, don't quit your job

**2. Know What You Can Buy**
- A $1 million windfall is NOT a ticket to being a millionaire — after taxes you may have ~$600,000
- Rule of thumb: you can spend ~$5,000/year per $100,000 of invested capital
- So $600,000 invested = ~$30,000/year in additional income
- Start by withdrawing only 4% in year one ($24,000), increase by inflation each year
- At 8% annual return, $600,000 grows to $1.2 million in 9 years, $2.4 million in 18 years if untouched

**3. Make a Wish List**
- Write down what you'd want your life to be like if money weren't a factor
- Envision your life: now, in 1 year, in 5 years, in 10 years
- Create three goal lists: short-term (within a year), intermediate (5 years), long-term
- Rank goals in each category by importance
- Align spending with goals — invest in making dreams come true, not frittering it away

**4. Get Professional Help**
- Start with a CPA who does NOT sell investment products (no conflict of interest)
- A good CPA can: assess your finances, calculate taxes due, recommend insurance changes, advise on estate planning, compare lump-sum vs. monthly distributions
- For financial planners: look for CFA or CFP designations (see Ch. 16)
- Get advice and insurance from **different sources** to avoid conflicts

## Chapter 16: Do You Need an Advisor?

> "I helped put two children through Harvard — my broker's children." — Michael LeBoeuf

Brokerage house saying: "When someone buys or sells an investment, the broker makes money, and the brokerage house makes money, and two out of three ain't bad." The broker's interests and yours **aren't aligned**.

Most Bogleheads are DIY investors who discovered that brokers sold them high-cost, loaded mutual funds and expensive annuities that earned big commissions but weren't in the client's best interest. Financial education is the key — investing basics should be taught in schools but aren't.

### The Alphabet Soup of Financial Designations

**Generic titles requiring NO special education, testing, or certification:**
- Financial advisor, financial analyst, financial consultant, financial planner, investment consultant
- Per the SEC: *Anyone can use these terms without registering with securities regulators or meeting any educational and experience requirements*

**FINRA lists nearly 150 professional designations.** Two of the most highly regarded:

**CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst):**
- Undergraduate degree required
- Must work in financial field
- 3 years investment decision-making experience (or 4 years qualified work)
- 750 hours of study (250 per level x 3 levels)
- Must pass comprehensive exam at each of 3 levels (one per year)

**CFP (Certified Financial Planner):**
- Must master 100+ financial planning topics across 7 areas: general planning, insurance, employee benefits, investment, income tax, retirement, estate planning
- Bachelor's degree required (since 2007)
- Must pass a comprehensive practical examination

**Table 16.1 — Professional Designations Acronym Soup** (partial list of ~50 designations from AAMS to WMS — many geared toward specific niches like divorce, seniors, estate planning, retirement)

### How Advisors Are Paid

**Commission-based advisors** (brokers, insurance agents): paid when they sell you products — creates conflict of interest. Say "No, thanks."

**Fee-only advisors (AUM):** charge a percentage of Assets Under Management (0.25% to 2%+ per year). Pros: advisor is free to recommend no-load, low-cost investments. Cons: even 2% on a bond fund yielding 4% consumes 50% of your return. You still pay the AUM fee even in years your portfolio loses money.

**Fee-based ≠ Fee-only:** "Fee-based" is an ambiguous term often used by salespeople who also earn commissions. Beware of brokers selling B shares and variable annuities who call themselves "fee-based."

**Wrap accounts:** bundle AUM fee, commissions, and expenses into one fee (typically 2-3% per year) — generally 1-2% higher than necessary.

**One-time fee or hourly rate:** best for DIY investors who want a financial roadmap then implement it themselves. Advisor works for you since you're paying the entire bill — interests are aligned.

> "Asset allocation is critically important; but cost is critically important, too. All other factors pale in significance." — Jack Bogle

**SEC guidelines for hiring an advisor:**
- Know your financial objectives and needed services before shopping
- Get names from trusted sources; interview several; check designations, experience, disciplinary history
- Understand how they're paid and any financial incentives tied to products
- Verify registration with FINRA, SEC, or state regulators
- Check if firm is SIPC member (limited protection if firm becomes insolvent)
- Don't rush — do your background investigation

## Part II: Follow-Through Strategies to Keep You on Target

---

## Chapter 17: Track Your Progress and Rebalance When Necessary

> "Foolproof systems don't take into account the ingenuity of fools." — Gene Brown

### Principles of Rebalancing

**Rebalancing** = bringing your portfolio back to your target asset allocation after market forces or life events have changed the percentages.

**Why rebalance:**
- Controls risk — brings portfolio back to your chosen risk level
- Forces "sell high, buy low" — selling outperforming assets, buying underperforming ones
- During the late 1990s dot-com craze, investors who didn't rebalance and let tech winners run saw portfolios drop 70% when Nasdaq collapsed; those who rebalanced into bonds minimized losses
- Portfolios that were **never rebalanced** had the **lowest Sharpe ratios** (worst risk-adjusted returns)
- **Reversion to the mean (RTM):** asset classes tend to revert over time — by rebalancing, you sell before reversion down and buy before reversion up

**Cindy Sin-Yi Tsai study** (*Journal of Financial Planning*, Oct 2001) compared rebalancing methods: never, monthly, quarterly, 5% threshold monthly, 5% threshold quarterly. All rebalancing methods outperformed never-rebalancing on a risk-adjusted basis.

### Assessing a Portfolio

**How to know if you need to rebalance:**
1. Know your desired asset allocation (stocks/bonds/cash breakdown, plus sub-allocations like large cap, small cap, international)
2. Know where your portfolio currently stands relative to that target

**How often to check:** Depends on your temperament. Confident, educated investors may benefit from frequent checking (educational). Skittish investors prone to panic-selling should check less often — perhaps only open December statements.

### When Should I Rebalance?

**Two methods:**

**1. Time-based:** Rebalance at fixed intervals (quarterly, semiannually, annually). Morningstar found 18-month intervals reaped similar benefits to more frequent rebalancing with lower costs. Added benefit in taxable accounts: holdings over 12 months qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

**2. Expansion bands:** Create a window (e.g., ±5 percentage points from target). If target equity is 60%, rebalance when equities fall below 55% or rise above 65%. Requires more frequent monitoring. Be careful in taxable accounts — strict expansion band rebalancing can trigger short-term capital gains.

**Morningstar finding for sub-allocations:** Rebalance when any segment rises or falls 25% from its target allocation (e.g., if large cap target is 60% of equities, rebalance when it hits 75% or 45%).

### Market Forces

**Table 17.1 — Stocks Up scenario:** $100K portfolio (60/35/5), stocks +10%, bonds +6%, cash +3% → ending 61/34/5 — close enough, may skip rebalancing.

**Table 17.2 — Stocks Down scenario:** Same portfolio, stocks -20%, bonds +6%, cash +3% → ending 53/41/6 — significant drift, need to rebalance.

**Table 17.3 — Rebalancing adjustments:** Need to add $6,150 to stocks, reduce bonds by $5,512.50, reduce cash by $637.50 to restore 60/35/5.

### How to Rebalance

- Sell overperforming assets and buy underperforming ones
- Withdraw income from the "hot hand" asset class (selling high)
- Direct new contributions into underweight asset classes
- Redirect mutual fund distributions to underweight funds instead of reinvesting in the same fund
- Use a portfolio manager (Vanguard's Asset Management Service, Portfolio Solutions) — they handle rebalancing as part of their service

### Other Rebalancing Considerations

- **Rebalance tax-deferred accounts first** — no tax consequences
- Get rid of funds that no longer fit your plan
- In withdrawal phase, use required distributions to help rebalance
- **Tax-loss harvest** in taxable accounts: sell losers before Dec 31 for tax benefits
- If selling winners in taxable accounts, consider waiting until after Jan 1 to defer taxes
- More frequent rebalancing by selling profitable funds = sooner tax payments
- Pick a memorable rebalance date (birthday, New Year)
- **Simplest solution:** own a target-date fund (Vanguard LifeStrategy or Target Retirement) that automatically rebalances
- Broad market index funds rebalance themselves automatically
- Life changes (inheritance, aging) may require revising your target allocation entirely

## Chapter 18: Tune Out the "Noise"

> "A fake fortuneteller can be tolerated. But an authentic soothsayer should be shot on sight." — Lazarus Long

In 1980, few Americans owned stocks and only 6% owned mutual funds. Today, over half of U.S. households own marketable securities — the single greatest financial change in the past quarter century, creating an enormous market for financial media.

All media have one goal: **attract and hold an audience** to sell advertising. When it comes to investing, this often conflicts with your interests.

### The Great Wall Street Marketing Machine

The sales pitch: "Invest with us because we know how to beat the market." Far more often than not, this is **fictitious at best and financially disastrous at worst**.

Only two ways to outperform: choosing superior investments and/or superior market timing. Research shows the ability to do either consistently **is so rare it might as well be chance**.

> "Wall Street wants you to believe they are there to make money for you, but their true purpose is to make money from you." — Rick Ferri

- Investment pros have an **80% chance of underperforming** the market over the long haul
- The industry spends billions on propaganda to convince the public they can beat the market
- Required disclaimer "Past performance does not guarantee future results" should add: "Dangerous if swallowed"

### What the Investment Media Don't Want You to Know

Effective investing is incredibly simple:
1. Create a simple, diversified asset allocation plan
2. Invest in low-cost, no-load index funds according to your plan
3. Rebalance periodically, then stay the course

This simplicity is a problem for the media — boring advice doesn't attract audiences. So they churn out **"investment pornography"**: content designed to excite you about beating the market and get you to buy products/information. It's ultimately unfulfilling.

Three reasons most people haven't learned this:
1. Efficient markets and modern portfolio theory concepts are relatively new to the public
2. Most investors are first-generation with no formal investing education
3. There's a lot of noise from hidden sales agendas disguising itself as financial information

### The Three Biggest Lies — Wall Street Version

1. **"It's a stock picker's market"** — The pitch that active management will now prevail over indexing. Reality: the longer the time period, the greater the odds favor indexing.

2. **"The trend is your friend"** — Market timing based on trends. There is one long-term trend: over 200+ years of U.S. stock market history, the only long-term trend was **up**. If you bought a market portfolio and reinvested dividends, your odds of losing money in any single year were 32%, over 5 years dropped to 13%, over 10 years to only 2%. There has never been a 15-year period when stocks lost money.

> "I'd compare stock pickers to astrologers, but I don't want to badmouth astrologers." — Eugene Fama

3. **"We can predict the future"** — Historical patterns and trends amount to little more than selective perception. People see what they want to see. Trying to forecast the economy or markets in the short-run is largely an exercise in futility.

### Separating Soothsayers from the Truth Sayers

> "It ain't so much the things we don't know that get us in trouble. It's the things we know that ain't so." — Artemus Ward

Three guidelines for tuning up your noise detector:

**1. All Forecasting Is Noise**

Thought experiment: If you woke up with a one-year gift of stock market prophecy, would you publish a newsletter? Go on TV? Of course not — you'd keep quiet, borrow as much as you can, and invest. Anyone who truly could predict the market would be quiet about it, not selling newsletters.

Three kinds of investment experts:
1. Those who don't know what the market will do and know they don't know
2. Those who don't know what the market will do but believe they know
3. Those who don't know what the market will do and get paid to pretend they know

> Your predictions have as good a chance at being correct as Nobel Prize-winning economists, last year's top-performing mutual fund manager, *Peter Porn's Hot Stocks Newsletter*, and Joe Six-pack.

**2. Listen to the Helpers; Ignore the Hustlers**

Separating good from bad sources across media:
- **Radio/TV infomercials**: Almost always a con — making wealth by selling bad information to a gullible public
- **Investment newsletters**: Most have the lifespan of a fruit fly. "The only way to make money with a newsletter is by selling one." — Malcolm Forbes
- **Free investment seminars/dinners**: Almost always sales pitches — "Meet the Grifters"
- **Investment call-in shows**: Mixed bag; good ones provide honest advice, bad ones brag about market-beating
- **Noncredit investment courses**: Often taught by brokers/planners trolling for clients
- **Audio/video wealth-building programs**: Good ones teach saving discipline; bad ones serve up "investment porn by the bucket"
- **Investment print journalism**: Some of the best advice available; follow writers like Jason Zweig (*WSJ*) and Jane Bryant Quinn

> *"Mutual funds reporters lead a secret investing life. By day we write 'Six Funds to Buy NOW!' ... By night, however, we invest in sensible index funds."* — Anonymous, *Fortune* magazine, April 1999

- **Books**: Don't assume a bestseller equals good advice. Charles J. Givens (*Wealth Without Risk*) declared bankruptcy. Robert Allen (*Nothing Down*) went bankrupt. Wade Cook promised hundreds of percent returns and had constant IRS trouble. Physician, heal thyself.
- **Internet websites**: The Wild West — unregulated, anyone can make claims. But also an excellent place to learn sound investing basics. The three authors likely never would have met without it.

**3. Be a Bona Fide Skeptic and Do Your Homework**

The best antidote to noise is knowledge based on empirical research by competent, unbiased parties with no interest in selling products. Read books and articles by leading finance professors and investment practitioners — their research results are remarkably consistent with each other and this book.

## Chapter 19: Mastering Your Investments Means Mastering Your Emotions

> "You aim for the palace and get drowned in the sewer." — Mark Twain

*"If we can dream it, we can do it."* — The traditional American attitude of unbridled optimism works in most areas of life but **fails spectacularly in investing**. The paradox of money: while most people are very emotional about acquiring it, behaving emotionally about money is a recipe for losing it.

### Welcome to the Field of Behavioral Economics

Classical economics assumes humans make conscious, rational choices to maximize satisfaction. Effective advertisers and salespeople know this is about as realistic as the tooth fairy — people usually buy emotionally and justify with logic.

In the late 1960s, psychologists **Amos Tversky** and **Daniel Kahneman** at Hebrew University in Jerusalem pioneered *behavioral economics*. They organized and classified the mental shortcuts (*judgmental heuristics*) people use to make quick economic decisions. Most are more emotional than rational.

Kahneman shared a Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002 — the first psychologist to do so. (Tversky died of cancer in 1996 at age 59.)

### Greed and Fear

Prehistoric man depended on greed and fear to survive — gorge when food is available, run from predators. In the jungle, acting on these emotions is critical for survival. **In investing, fear and greed diminish and destroy returns.**

The Dalbar study (1993-2012): the average mutual fund investor underperformed the S&P 500 by **3.96% per year**. Much of this was caused by investor behavior — excitedly chasing performance (buying high when market is up) and panicking (selling low when market is down).

> "We have met the enemy, and he is us." — Pogo

### How Smart People Make Bad Investment Decisions

**Ego and Overconfidence**

May be the biggest return killer. Despite statistical impossibility, at least 70% of Americans believe they are above average. This self-belief is useful in life but **hazardous to your wealth** in investing — short-run stock market ups and downs are random happenings where intelligence, skill, and knowledge give you no edge.

Three cautionary tales:
1. **The Beardstown Ladies**: 14 Illinois grandmothers claimed 23.4% average annual returns vs S&P 500's 14.9%. Actual return: only 9.1%. They simply didn't know how to calculate performance correctly.
2. **Mensa Investment Club**: During a 15-year period when S&P 500 averaged 15.3%, Mensa (top 2% IQ) averaged only 2.5%.
3. **Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)**: Created with two Nobel Prize-winning economists who believed they could eliminate risk. Controlled $1.25 trillion in leveraged positions. Collapsed in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Required a $3.6 billion Fed-orchestrated bailout.

> *The stock market is a very expensive place to learn that neither you nor anyone else is endowed with the gift of investment prophecy.*

Women tend to earn better returns than men because they trade less and take more prudent risks. Men, taught to take bold action, create worse outcomes — in investing, taking bold action to solve investment problems usually creates worse problems.

**Loss Aversion**

The flip side of overconfidence. We feel the pain of a $100 loss **twice as much** as the benefit of a $100 gain. Many people burned by a market loss vow to never invest again.

> "A cat who sits on a hot stove will never sit on a hot stove again, but he will probably never sit on a cold one either." — Mark Twain

People who keep all money in CDs after a crash may think they're risk-free, but after taxes and inflation, they're actually losing purchasing power. What's perceived as safe isn't always safe.

**Paralysis by Analysis**

With thousands of funds and an abundance of noise, some people never make a choice — and never invest. Every day you don't invest is a day less of compounding. Remember: you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

**The Endowment Effect**

The tendency to overvalue what we already own. Common mistakes:
- Investing the bulk of your money in your employer's stock (ask former Enron employees)
- Buying only domestic funds in the belief that U.S. investments are safer
- Recommendation: invest approximately 20% of equities in foreign stocks

**Following the Herd**

Following the herd in investing is following it to the slaughterhouse. Herd investors don't have a sound plan, listen to noise, buy and sell at the wrong times. Call it *The Beardstown Ladies Effect* — since most believe they're above average, they conclude their returns are above average too.

**Mental Accounting**

Treating money differently based on where it comes from. A tax refund isn't "found money" — it's an interest-free loan you gave the government. A nonrefundable plane ticket is a sunk cost that should be ignored when deciding whether to take the trip. Keeping retirement money in safe investments while carrying credit card debt is irrational.

**Anchoring**

Clinging to an old belief or price despite evidence it's harmful. Holding a losing stock until it returns to "your price." Sticking with a money manager without checking if they earn the market return. "My mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts."

**Financial Negligence**

Procrastination is the biggest detriment to financial success. Many people delegate all financial tasks and have no idea how much they're spending in commissions, fees, taxes, and management costs. The surest way to lose money is to pay no attention to it.

### Keeping Emotions in Check

1. **Write down your major financial goals** with dates and dollar amounts. Good planning begins by setting financial goals and target dates.
2. **Practice the techniques in this book** — you'll automatically side-step most emotional traps. Pay off debt, formulate a simple asset allocation plan, invest in index funds, keep costs low, rebalance, stay the course.
3. **Forget the notion that investing is supposed to be fun and exciting.** If you seek excitement through investing, you're going to lose money. It's a short trip from the penthouse to the outhouse.
4. **Don't expect to be perfectly rational all the time.** If you make a poor emotional decision, learn from it and don't repeat it. Author Elbert Hubbard: "Everyone is a fool for at least five minutes a day. Wisdom consists of not exceeding the limit."
5. **If you want thrills**, take a maximum of 5% of your portfolio and create a "casino account" for active trading. One rule: if you lose it all, it's gone forever. No more casino accounts.

### How To Escape the Emotional Traps

- **Recency bias**: Never assume today's results predict tomorrow's
- **Overconfidence**: No one can consistently predict short-term market movements
- **Loss aversion**: Be a risk *manager* instead of a risk *avoider*
- **Paralysis by analysis**: Put together a plan and get started
- **The endowment effect**: Get an objective evaluation; invest no more than 10% in employer's stock
- **Mental accounting**: All money spends the same regardless of source; sunk costs should play no part in future decisions
- **Anchoring**: Holding out for "your price" is a fool's game; get a second opinion on your financial person
- **Financial negligence**: Take the time to learn sound investing — it's really pretty simple stuff

## Chapter 20: Making Your Money Last Longer Than You Do

> "I've got all the money I'll ever need, if I die by four o'clock." — Henny Youngman

The big question for retirees: "How much of my portfolio can I spend each year without running out of money?" The answer requires knowing unknowable things — your date of death, future returns, inflation rates, health care costs, and more.

### The Retiree's Spending Dilemma

Two ways to go wrong in retirement:
1. **Overspending early** — running out of money later
2. **Underspending** — driven by irrational fear, depriving yourself of goods, services, and experiences. Sowing the seed without reaping the harvest.

> The story of **Jacob Leeder**: Drove a 1984 Oldsmobile, lived modestly, never took vacations ("Not now, the market is bad"). When he died in 1997, his estate was valued at approximately **$36 million** — a complete shock to everyone.

> "The pride of dying rich raises the loudest laugh in hell." — John W. Foster

### The Two Best Ways to Insure Income for Life

The retiree's motto: **"Be flexible."**

**1. Keep fixed living expenses as low as possible.** No enormous mortgage, expensive car payments, or credit card debt. Low overhead gives you flexibility to spend less in bear markets, more in bull markets.

**2. Have a viable way to earn income if needed.** Not necessarily full-time work — technology makes it possible to do many paid tasks from home. Working part-time keeps you productive, mentally sharp, and reduces portfolio withdrawals.

### Three More Ways to Ensure Income for Life

**1. Delay retirement.** Every year you delay = one more year to save, one more year of compounding, one year less depending on portfolio.

**2. Wait to draw Social Security.** Delaying from age 62 to full retirement age provides a 33% larger inflation-adjusted pension. Waiting until age 70 garners 8% higher per year above full retirement age. For couples, delay the higher benefit to age 70 while the other draws earlier.

**3. Purchase an immediate annuity.** Can be good for those aged 75+. Drawbacks for younger retirees: lower payouts, based on current (low) interest rates, most have no inflation protection, money doesn't go back to estate if you die early.

### A Prudent Plan for Tapping Your Portfolio

**Do NOT assume you can withdraw 10% per year** because stocks historically returned ~10%. Returns are uneven — above-average years are usually well over 10%, below-average years are negative. Retiring into a bear market can devastate a portfolio.

Most credible 30-year portfolio survival studies conclude you can withdraw **4 to 6% per year** with a good chance of not exhausting the portfolio. Above 6%, odds of survival diminish rapidly.

Key withdrawal guidelines:
- **Inflation-adjusted withdrawals**: Begin by withdrawing no more than **4%** of portfolio's beginning value, increasing annually with cost of living
- **Fixed percentage of current value**: Withdraw a maximum of **5%** per year (be prepared for pay cuts in down years)

Longevity planning: A 65-year-old man has a 20% chance of living to 90; a 65-year-old woman has 32%. For a married couple, there's a 45% chance one will live to 90. Half of all retirees live longer than their life expectancy.

> Most important: be financially flexible, particularly in early years. Keep fixed expenses low. Don't let money concerns deprive you of enjoying the freedom to spend your time pursuing the activities — and enjoying the people — you treasure most.

## Chapter 21: Protect Your Assets by Being Well-Insured

> "Insurance is the business of protecting you against everything, except the insurance agent." — Evan Esar

One bad uninsured mishap can financially ruin you or your family forever. Types of insurance to consider: life, health care, disability, property, auto, liability, and long-term care.

### Common Insurance Mistakes

Three types:
1. **Insuring the unimportant while ignoring the critical** — Extended warranties on TVs but no liability umbrella policy. Life insurance for singles with no dependents but no disability coverage.
2. **Insuring based on odds of misfortune** — Never fail to buy insurance just because odds are small. If the loss would devastate you financially and the odds are small, the insurance will be cheap.
3. **Insuring against specific, narrow circumstances** — Airport life insurance, accidental death insurance, Alzheimer's-specific policies. Buy comprehensive coverage, not narrow policies designed for emotional/impulse buying.

### Three Key Rules for Being Properly Insured

1. Only insure against big catastrophes you can't afford out of pocket. The cheapest insurance is self-insurance.
2. Carry the largest possible deductibles you can afford — the larger the deductible, the cheaper the premium.
3. Only buy from the best-rated insurance companies (A. M. Best rating of A or better).

### Life Insurance

Purpose: provide financial support to dependents deprived by a breadwinner's death. If you have no dependents or are financially independent, you don't need it.

**Buy term insurance.** It's basic pay-as-you-go, no-frills insurance — the cheapest way. Salespeople will push whole life, universal life, and variable universal life because they pocket 50-100% of the first year's premium on cash-value policies. **Don't mix insurance with investing.** Insurance is for protection; investing is for wealth building.

Young people without dependents should save and invest their money, not buy life insurance. Buy only when your situation requires it.

Table 21.1 provides a 10-step formula for computing how much life insurance you need (annual income shortfall x years needed + emergency funds + funeral expenses + other needs - existing assets).

### Health Care

Most important feature when buying your own: **major medical coverage** — hospitalization, surgery, doctors' charges, rehabilitation. Lifetime benefit should be minimum $1 million, preferably $2 million.

Reduce costs by taking the highest deductible and co-payment you can afford. Consider **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)** — combine high-deductible insurance with tax-favored savings. Contributions are tax deductible, money used for health care is tax-free, unused money grows tax-deferred.

Good health care plan features: freedom to see your doctor, no dollar limits on hospital procedures, annual out-of-pocket cap, international coverage.

### Long-Term Disability Coverage

Your most valuable financial asset is your **future earning power**. While 70% carry life insurance, only 40% carry disability — despite disability being far more likely than premature death.

Harvard/Law School study: More than half of personal bankruptcies in 2001 were caused by illness and medical bills. Surprisingly, 75% of those bankrupted had health insurance when misfortune struck.

Tips:
- Buy as much as you need (maximum ~60% of income)
- Consider purchasing with after-tax dollars — then disability income is tax-free
- Good policy features: covers inability to work in your own occupation, 90-day waiting period, cost-of-living adjustment, partial disability benefits, coverage to at least age 65

Sobering stat: A 35-year-old has a **20% chance** of becoming disabled before age 65, and a 1-in-7 chance it will last 5+ years.

### Protecting Your Property

**Home/Renter's insurance**: Insure for *replacement cost*, not purchase price. Cover all potential disasters (floods and earthquakes usually require separate riders). Document possessions with photos/video.

**Auto insurance**: If you drive an older car, consider dropping comprehensive and collision. Reduce costs with highest deductible, security features, and good driving record.

**Liability umbrella policy**: Purchase at least $1 million or enough to cover your total net worth. Relatively cheap protection against lawsuits.

**Business insurance**: Home-based businesses need additional coverage beyond homeowner's policy.

### Long-Term Care

> "Five out of 1,000 people will experience a house fire: average cost $3,400. Seventy out of 1,000 will have an auto accident: average cost $3,000. Six hundred out of 1,000 will require a nursing home stay: average cost $50,000 per year, with an average stay of three to five years." — Sue Stevens, Morningstar

Nursing home costs now well over $100,000/year in some areas. Two groups don't need it: very high net worth (self-insure) and very low net worth (Medicaid). Everyone in between with $200,000-$2 million in liquid assets should seriously consider it.

Good policy features: daily benefit matching local nursing home costs, 5% annual inflation protection, 3-5 year benefit period (lifetime is best), 100-day elimination period, covers both skilled and nonskilled care plus home health and assisted living, no exclusions for Alzheimer's/dementia, waiver of premium, cannot be canceled, tax qualified.

**Buy before age 60** — waiting until 70 means premiums are 2.5x higher, plus greater risk of becoming uninsurable.

### Locating Good Insurance Companies and Agents

Shop online for quotes and compare. Check financial strength ratings from A. M. Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P. Find a competent, customer-oriented agent — ask for recommendations from trusted professionals. Look for credentials: CPCU, CLU, CIC.

Give one good agent as much of your business as possible — you become a more important customer with better service.

Reduce the odds of needing insurance: Don't smoke, exercise regularly, moderate drinking, wear seatbelts, eat right, maintain proper weight, get regular check-ups, keep a positive attitude.

## Chapter 22: Passing It On When You Pass On

> "Rich people plan for three generations. Poor people plan for Saturday night." — Gloria Steinem

Estate tax laws at the time of death determine whether your estate pays additional taxes for being "too rich." The current tax exemption is $5,340,000, adjusted annually for inflation.

Two certainties in life: death and taxes. The accumulation of assets is a lifelong endeavor achieved with personal sacrifice. Make sure the distribution is accomplished in a timely and efficient manner, going to those you choose with minimum expense.

### Documents We'll Need

**A Will**

Everyone should have a will, even with a trust. It names the legal guardian for minor children. Instructs your executor on asset distribution. Without a will (intestate), the court appoints both executor and guardian, and your state's succession laws determine who inherits.

Ways to avoid probate: placing assets in a trust, distribution by title (joint accounts, POD, TOD), listing beneficiaries on tax-deferred accounts. Note: avoiding probate does not mean avoiding estate taxes.

**Living Trust**

A *revocable trust* avoids probate — trust assets don't go through court, affairs stay private, disposition starts immediately. You serve as your own trustee and retain full control. Name a successor trustee for incapacity or death.

Trusts are more costly to create than wills. Various types include bypass, irrevocable, special needs, QTIP, generation-skipping, grantor retained interest, and charitable remainder trusts.

**Powers of Attorney**

- *Limited power of attorney*: allows someone to act on your behalf in specific situations
- *Durable power of attorney for finances*: allows someone to manage your financial affairs if you become incapacitated
- *Durable power of attorney for health care*: allows someone to make medical decisions on your behalf (cannot override your advance health care directive)

**Advance Health Care Directive (Living Will)**

Conveys your specific wishes regarding medical treatments and life-prolonging efforts when you can't communicate. The Terry Schiavo case (debated through courts 1998-2005, including Congress and U.S. Supreme Court) illustrates the importance of putting wishes in writing.

### Other Considerations

**Stepped-up cost basis**: Heirs receive inherited assets at their value at time of death. Appreciated taxable assets (stocks, equity mutual funds) pass with no capital gains taxes owed by heirs.

Strategy for those with adequate assets: Consider spending down tax-deferred accounts (IRAs) first and leaving appreciated taxable assets to heirs — they get the step-up in cost basis and avoid capital gains taxes. This is the opposite of conventional wisdom (spend taxable first).

### Gifting

Currently, an individual can give **$14,000 per year** to an unlimited number of people with no tax consequences. Couples can give double. Exceptions with no limit:
- Gifts to a U.S. citizen spouse
- Tuition or medical bills paid *directly to the school or facility*
- Gifts to charities (up to 50% of income excluded from annual limit)

**Charitable trusts**: Make a donation, get a tax write-off, and receive annuity payments for life. Can include appreciated assets to avoid capital gains taxes.

### Letter of Instruction

A letter containing your desires regarding funeral arrangements, organ donations, location of important papers, and final messages to loved ones. Give it to the person who will carry out these instructions.

## Chapter 23: You Can Do It — The Bogleheads Will Help

> "Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending." — Carl Bard

Whether you're a new investor, someone with limited experience, or a veteran who's made the usual mistakes — the information in this book gives you the tools to succeed. Procrastination is the biggest detriment to financial success.

### What We've Learned

- **Choose a sound financial lifestyle** — pay off debt, establish emergency fund, live below your means
- **Start early and invest regularly** — the longer you invest, the more compounding works for you
- **Know your investment choices** — stocks, bonds, mutual funds; don't invest in things you don't understand
- **Figure out how much you need for retirement** — you can't reach a goal without a target
- **Indexing via low-cost mutual funds** will most likely outperform the vast majority of strategies over time
- **Asset allocation** is based on your personal circumstances, goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Keep it simple.
- **Costs matter** — commissions, fees, expense ratios rob you of returns. Keep costs as low as possible.
- **Taxes can be your biggest expense** — put tax-inefficient funds in tax-deferred accounts, tax-efficient in taxable
- **Rebalancing** controls risk and may reward you with higher returns
- **Market timing and performance chasing** are poor investment strategies
- **Invest for your children's education** — several tax-deferred and tax-free options available
- **Know how to handle a windfall**
- **Understand the question of financial advisors** — pros and cons
- **Protect future buying power** with inflation-protected securities
- **Tune out the noise** — avoid hot investment fads and following the herd
- **Protect your assets** with proper insurance (not an investment — don't confuse the two)
- **Master your emotions** — letting emotions dictate investment decisions is hazardous to wealth
- **Make your money last** — overly optimistic withdrawal rates can lead to running out of money
- **Proper estate planning** ensures assets pass to heirs in a reasonable time with minimum taxes
