## Foreword to the New Edition (Pierre Lassonde)

Lassonde lost his first million in the 1980 gold crash ($850/oz) investing in penny gold stocks. That motivated serious study of gold markets, leading him to Jastram's book.

Key points from the Foreword:
- Jastram used wholesale commodity price indices for UK and US from 1560-1976 as a proxy for general prices, comparing them to gold prices to measure gold's "operational wealth" (purchasing power)
- **Main finding:** Gold's price has been remarkably similar for centuries at a time. Its purchasing power in the mid-20th century was very nearly the same as in the mid-17th century
- **Counterintuitive conclusions:** Gold has been a poor hedge against major inflation, but its value appreciated in major deflations
- These conclusions are counterintuitive only because for most of the four centuries studied, the gold price was fixed by law
- After 1971 (Nixon ended gold's monetary function), gold rose from $35/oz to $850 (1980), back to $250 (2000), then over $1,000 (March 2008)
- Supply side: South Africa's dominance declined from 75% to <15% of mine production. Production diversified globally. Mine production falling since 2001
- Demand side: Pre-1971 central banks were major buyers; now jewelry accounts for ~70% of consumption. India and China emerged as dominant players. Gold ETFs (pioneered 2003) transferred >1,000 tonnes from central bank reserves to private investors
- Central banks became net sellers over the last 20 years but will eventually exhaust reserves or complete planned sales
- Gold fulfills two fundamental human needs: adornment and security

> "This book, more than any other I have ever read, has given me my lifelong passion for understanding the role of gold in our societies."

## Preface (Roy W. Jastram)

Jastram's interest in gold began in 1936 as a junior faculty member at Stanford, commissioned by industrialist C.O.G. Miller to research whether money was worth more in past centuries. He chose gold as the monetary medium most likely to have a consistent definition over time. The modest paper was never published but the interest stayed with him. The explosion of gold prices in 1968 revived his attention and became the inception of this book.

## Introduction

This book is a quantitative study of the economic history of England and the United States, time frame 1560-1976.

**Purpose:** To transpose speculative thought about gold into actual numbers using quantitative evidence. Two streams of statistics: (1) general behavior of commodity prices over long periods, and (2) the price of gold specifically.

**Why gold?** Not for its cultural/religious/artistic significance, but for a pragmatic reason: gold is the most consistent standard of comparison for measuring wealth across times and places. Many kinds of wealth can't be measured in man-hours, but all can be expressed in terms of gold.

**Key concept — Operational Wealth:** The ability of a person to "operate" with his dollars. Depends on (a) how many dollars he has and (b) the prices of things. Monetary wealth stays constant at $100,000 but operational wealth halves if prices double. It is a "convenient fiction" — the dollar equivalence of commanding goods at going prices.

**The schema of the work:**
1. Construct a unified series of the price of gold since 1560 (market prices, Bank of England buying prices, Mint prices)
2. Construct a unified series of wholesale commodity prices every year since 1560
3. Determine the statistical relationship between gold prices and commodity prices to measure the purchasing power of gold
4. Discover how gold's purchasing power behaves during inflation and deflation
5. Judge whether gold has served as an inflation hedge and wealth conservator in deflation

**Why England?**
- Unusually long data availability with constant political boundaries (unlike Germany, Italy, France)
- Not invaded by foreign power since 1066
- Remarkably consistent monetary system: pounds/shillings/pence from Norman Conquest to 1971 decimalization (~700 years, no break)
- A nation of record keepers — trade, money, and prices were their obsessions
- At the heart of global economic activity for centuries
- Chief source: Lord Beveridge's *Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century* (1939) — prices for nearly 170 commodities

**Why start at 1560?** The Great Recoinage. English coinage had been chronically debased. After Henry VIII's death (1547), purchasing power had depreciated ~20%. By 1560 the pound could buy about half the commodities it could two decades earlier. Queen Elizabeth's Great Recoinage of 1560 reformed the currency, providing a meaningful starting point for price comparisons.

**Gresham's Law:** "Bad money drives out good" — attributed to Sir Thomas Gresham but the proposition goes back to Aristophanes.

**The United States** is covered from 1800 onward as a comparison — formerly an English colony, shares economic institutions and traditions with England.

## PART I: THE ENGLISH EXPERIENCE

---

## Chapter 1: The Price of Gold

This is a study of gold's ability to command other goods in exchange — not a treatise on money per se, but the monetary role of gold is essential background.

### The Penny and the Pound

- The word "penny" comes from "pending" — silver coins issued by King Penda of Mercia (7th century)
- Over the next 100 years, these coins spread through Saxon kingdoms, exchanged by count ("tale"), with 240 always called a "pound"
- A 1266 statute decreed the penny should weigh "thirty-two wheat corns in the midst of the ear" — simply making official an old tradition
- A 1280 statute set the penny at 24 grains, matching the schedule of official weights. The 24-grain pennyweight continued into the 16th century for use in the Mint
- In the 12th century the penny was called a "sterling" (from "steorra" = star, because early pennies were star-imprinted). The reputation of "sterling silver" was built on the quality of the silver penny, not the other way around
- William the Conqueror established the principal Mint in the Tower of London, adopting the "Tower pound" (6.25% lighter than troy pound)

### The Changing Role of Gold and Silver

- Before the late 17th century, silver was the effective basis for English coinage and everyday transactions
- Gold coins first came to England through international trade (tin exports → Florentine gold florins)
- Edward III struck the first English gold coin in 1344 — the "noble" (6s 8d, or one-third of a pound)

- 1257: Henry III minted first English gold penny (45 troy grains, proclaimed at 20 pence). Failed — too high value for small transactions, undervalued in terms of silver for large ones
- From 1257 to 1717, fourteen different English gold coins were issued. Gold coinage was a stranger to early England and didn't catch on until the 18th century
- Gold couldn't handle common business like silver because of its high value relative to incomes. But over time, transaction sizes grew, making gold coins convenient for merchants and larger agriculturists
- **East India Company drained silver eastward** — India wanted silver, not English cloth. In 1717 alone, the Company exported 3 million ounces of silver, much from melting English silver coins
- After the 1713 peace with France, trade increased and the French settled balances in gold → massive gold influx to England
- In the 3 years after 1713, over £4 million of gold was minted. Silver coins were melted and disappearing. England was moving toward a de facto gold standard without plan or conscious motivation

### The Gold Standard Comes to England

- **The guinea** (1663): Named for the tiny elephant imprint showing the gold came from Africa. Nominal face value 20 shillings, but never circulated at that price — by January 1665 it traded at 21s 4d, and always remained above 21 shillings
- The guinea's market premium over its face value showed the gold-silver price ratio was out of line with the bullion market ratio
- **December 22, 1717:** Proclamation forbade exchanging guineas at more than 21 shillings. If guineas stayed at 21s and silver shilling pieces continued at 12 pence, England would have remained on a silver standard. But shilling pieces went to a premium → England *ipso facto* changed to a gold standard
- **This was accidental** — "a classic case of 'Let the marketplace decide.'" Nobody designed or deliberately established the gold standard
- The purchasing power of gold was irrelevant before England went on the gold standard. The formal gold standard wasn't solemnized until 1816 (Lord Liverpool's Act), following the Napoleonic Wars

### The Philosophy of Hard Money

- In the 1690s, John Locke was called by Lord Keeper Somers to advise on the chronically debased coinage
- Locke's essay *Further Considerations Concerning Raising the Value of Money* argued that reducing the bullion content of coins would be an injustice to creditors
- Locke insisted the only true pound was 3 ounces, 17 pennyweight, 10 grains of sterling silver — the only remedy was recoining at the original rate
- **Locke's radical contribution:** He attached sanctity to the Mint weights as something new. Before him, kings altered coin weights at will. By the 15th century the notion that Mint weights shouldn't change had already disappeared. Locke made immutability of the monetary unit a philosophical principle
- The 1697-1698 recoinage restored the pre-debasement standard, over opposition from goldsmiths and bankers
- After 1696, Locke's gospel persisted. Peel's Acts of 1819 and 1844 stood on Locke's doctrine. The price of £3 17s 10.5d per standard ounce became "a magic price for gold from which England ought never to stray"

### The Statistics of Gold Prices

Three types of English gold prices in historical records:
1. **Market prices** — freely negotiated between individuals/institutions for bullion exchange
2. **Bank of England buying prices** — posted prices at which the Bank stands ready to receive gold (may have no takers on a given day)
3. **Mint prices** — prices at which the Mints stand ready to buy

These three are not always the same. For 1870-1914:
- Mint price: £3 17s 10.5d
- Bank buying price: £3 17s 9d (legally obligated minimum under 1844 Act)
- Bank could raise buying price but not go below £3 17s 9d
- Average annual London *market* price fluctuated between £3 17s 9d and £3 17s 11.23d
- **The average premium of market price over Bank minimum was only 0.057% for the entire 45 years** — gold prices were extraordinarily stable

### A World on the Gold Standard: A Digression (1870-1914)

- Peak period of gold as monetized metal. London dominated global finance
- Germany, Holland, Scandinavia adopted gold standard early in 1870s; Switzerland, Belgium, France by 1878; Austria 1892; Japan 1897; Russia 1899; Italy 1900
- US used inconvertible paper after Civil War until resuming specie payment in 1879; gold standard formalized in 1900
- Lloyd George: "The crackle of a bill on London was as good as the ring of gold in any port throughout the civilized world"
- Only China remained on the silver standard
- The English gold standard pre-WWI is often romanticized as smooth and automatic, but the system was never perfect — it was "never the perfect machine for unintended economic evenhandedness"

### The Statistics of Gold Prices Again

- Jastram's preference order: (a) market prices, (b) Bank buying prices, (c) Mint prices
- Mint price ascertainable back to 1343 (advantage of longevity); open market prices found consistently only for 1760-1829 and from 1870
- What matters for the study is *proportionate* changes over time
- The three price series rarely diverge far except under artificially constrictive conditions (e.g., Napoleonic Wars)

### The Tying Together of the Unified Series: The Index of Gold Prices

Price source schema for the unified series:
| Period | Source |
|--------|--------|
| 1560-1716 | Mint prices |
| 1717-1759 | Bank buying prices |
| 1760-1829 | London market prices |
| 1830-1869 | Bank buying prices |
| 1870-1976 | London market prices |

- Series are spliced at overlap years using ratios to avoid spurious jumps
- **Base year: 1930 = 100.0** (chosen because it was the last year before continuous gold price gyrations began, and prices had been nearly constant since 1925)

**Historical testimony on bullion markets:** Mocatta and Goldsmid (founded 1684, 10 years before the Bank of England) was the sole bullion broker since 1694. In 1810 testimony before the Bullion Committee, Aaron Asher Goldsmid confirmed: all transactions went through their office, all prices were real (not nominal), the Bank was informed of every private transaction. N.M. Rothschild entered in 1804, became bullion broker during the 1825 crisis when they brought in several million pounds of gold at even higher than Mint price.

### Key Data: Table 1 — Index of the Price of Gold, England 1560-1976 (1930=100)

Notable observations from the data:
- **1560-1600:** Index steady at 69.8 (Mint price unchanged)
- **1604-1611:** Jump to 76.0-82.3 (coinage adjustments)
- **1612-1662:** Stable at 84.3-84.9
- **1663-1716:** Rose to 94.7-101.8 (guinea era, gold revaluation)
- **1717-1799:** Remarkably stable at 99.5 (gold standard established)
- **1800-1815 (Napoleonic Wars):** Spiked to 141.2 in 1814, peak 134.8 in 1815
- **1821-1869:** Back to ~99.4-100.0 (gold standard restored)
- **1870-1914:** Incredibly stable at 99.8-99.9
- **1915-1930:** Rose to 106.0 in 1919-1920, back to 99.9 by 1925-1930
- **1931-1949:** Rose steadily from 108.8 to 220.7
- **1950-1967:** Fixed at 319.1 ($35/oz Bretton Woods)
- **1968-1976:** Exploded from 418.7 to 1697.5

### Key Data: Table 2 — Index of Wholesale Commodity Prices, England 1560-1976 (1930=100)

- **1560:** 40.0 — commodities were very cheap relative to 1930
- Prices gradually rose through the 16th-17th centuries
- By 1650: ~87.0; by 1750: ~73.4 (deflation)
- Napoleonic era peaks similar to gold price spikes
- Commodity prices exploded post-WWII: 1946=162.0, 1950=248.0, 1976=1248.4

### Key Data: Table 3 — Index of Purchasing Power of Gold, England 1560-1976 (1930=100)

Purchasing power = gold price index / commodity price index. Key observations:
- **1560:** 174.5 — gold bought far more goods in 1560 than in 1930
- **1562:** 271.6 (spike — commodity prices collapsed relative to gold after Great Recoinage)
- **1600-1700:** Fluctuated 100-150, generally declining as commodity prices rose faster than gold prices
- **1700-1790:** Ranged 100-125, fairly stable
- **1800-1820 (Napoleonic Wars):** Dropped sharply — 66.9 in 1800, bottomed at 65.6 in 1801. Gold's purchasing power was *halved* during the inflation
- **1820-1896:** Rose from 80.2 to a peak of 158.8 in 1896 during the great Victorian deflation
- **1897-1920:** Fell from 156.5 to 51.4 — massive loss of purchasing power during WWI inflation
- **1920-1930:** Recovered to 100.0
- **1930-1940:** Rose through the Depression (gold's purchasing power *increased* in deflation)
- **1950-1976:** Steadily declined from 128.7 to 136.0 (but this is misleading — gold was fixed at $35 while commodity prices soared; actual purchasing power collapsed)
- Post-1968 the numbers show some recovery as gold price was freed

### Chart I — The English Experience (1560-1976)

Three-line chart showing Gold price index, Commodity price index (CP), and Purchasing Power of Gold (PPG) on log scale. Key visual: the PPG line oscillates around a roughly stable level for centuries, with dramatic dips during inflations (Napoleonic, WWI) and rises during deflations (Victorian era, 1930s).

## Chapter 2: Historical Fluctuations in the Price of Gold

### 1343-1976: The Broad Sweep

Table 4 extends gold price data back to 1343 (from Feavearyear's *The Pound Sterling*). Gold prices in shillings per fine ounce:
- 1343: 24.72s (index 17.4)
- 1412: 29.34s (20.7)
- 1464-1465: 32.78-38.36s (23.1-27.0) — sharp jump
- 1526: 45.00s (31.7)
- 1544-1549: 48.00-60.00s (33.8-42.3) — Henry VIII debasement

**The broadest sweep of 633 years reveals three phases:**
1. **1343-1700:** Continuous, gradual rise in gold price index for 360 years
2. **1700-1930:** ~230 years of essentially stable prices (most of this time England was on the gold standard)
3. **1930-1976:** 45 years of utter instability, quite unprecedented in recorded history

### 1343-1700: The Long Climb to the Gold Standard

- Before 1492, the rise in gold prices (>60% from 1343-1492) was due to increased demand for gold to support rising commercial activity against essentially static stocks of metal — Feavearyear's "Struggle for Bullion"
- 1519: Cortez reached Mexico City. 1534: Pizarro returned from Peru with first treasure
- 1545: Rich deposits at Potosi (Peru) began supplying silver. 1555: Guanajuato (Mexico)
- During the 16th century, Spain received 181,235 kg of gold (199.4 tons) and 16,632,648 kg of silver (18,246 tons) on official record — plus unknown amounts via smugglers and pirates
- Despite the romance, New World gold was "just a trickle" — less than 1% of 1930 world production in each year from 1500-1520
- The price of gold continued to rise because demand outstripped supply
- **From 1600-1700** world gold production rose 1.7% per year, yet the price climbed to a level in 1700 below which it has *never fallen since*. Not even the surges from California, Australia, Alaska, Russia, and South Africa broke that price floor

### 1700-1800: The Gold Standard and Stability

- After gold standard adoption in 1717, prices remained constant at 77.5 shillings until 1760 (Bank buying price)
- **1760-1774:** Market prices broke upward due to (a) debased gold coinage and (b) rapid growth of country banks needing gold reserves
- Gold coins progressively became lighter through wear/clipping. Full-weight coins were exported as soon as minted. By 1773 nearly all gold coinage was debased
- Act of 1698 (originally for silver) extended to gold coins in 1773 with severe penalties for passing debased coins. Bank of England purchased defaced coins at Mint weight, bringing market price back to official levels by 1774
- **Country banks** exploded from ~12 in 1750 to almost 400 by 1793, all needing gold guinea reserves → new demand surge
- Crises of 1763, 1772, 1775, 1783, and the panic of 1793 (war with France) tested the system. Bank of England's bullion stock fell 50%. Yet gold prices held firm until 1800

### 1800-1820: Napoleon and the Aftermath

- **February 26, 1797:** Run on banks — people withdrawing guineas to bury in pastures and gardens. Order in Council suspended cash payments. England was off the gold standard
- No constraint on paper money supply except "the wisdom and resolve of the Directors of the Bank of England. Both of these were weak"
- Nobody at the Bank considered themselves responsible for regulating money supply. Directors publicly claimed they merely "supplied public demand"
- **1798-1800:** Commodity prices jumped from 116.6 to 168.2. First great inflation in 150 years
- Overheated economy fell back briefly, then the boom of 1808-1813 pushed commodity prices to 182.5
- **Gold prices rose from 100.0 in 1798 to 141.2 by 1814** — but this did NOT preserve purchasing power (commodity prices rose even faster)
- **David Ricardo** (1809) wrote to the *Morning Chronicle* arguing bank note overissue was putting a premium on gold. The "Bullion Committee" was formed and concluded the rise in bullion prices was caused solely by overissues of Bank of England notes
- The Directors were exonerated by the Committee as men who "had had a greater responsibility thrust on them than anyone could be expected to bear"
- **In France:** The assignat crashed to zero in early 1795. France returned to gold standard. French people transferred savings home. Good gold rushed back, draining from England → further pressure on English gold prices
- After Waterloo, England eventually restored cash payments and the gold standard

### 1914-1946: Two Wars and the Great Depression

- WWI mobilized whole nations — unprecedented resource demands. Civil consumption minimized
- **1914:** Paper still legally convertible to gold, but gold exports forbidden. London price held steady but substance of gold standard was removed
- **March 1919:** Sterling-dollar exchange support removed → sterling fell sharply → gold exports would have surged → but export forbidden, so gold standard was maintained in appearance only
- **1919-1925:** London was the gold market for Empire bullion (mainly South African), passing it to America. Sterling-dollar rate dominated the London gold price. Gold rose to a premium over Mint price
- **April 28, 1925:** Churchill's speech — Gold Standard Act of 1925 ("gold-bullion" standard):
  1. Repealed all statutes making paper money payable in gold coin
  2. Denied right of free access to the Mint
  3. Bank of England obligated to sell gold only in bars (~400 troy ounces minimum) at £3 17s 10.5d
- Churchill paid allegiance to Locke's 200-year-old doctrine. Keynes: "It was an automatic and painful act"
- By 1925, global gold distribution had shifted: European countries held only 45% (down from 54% in 1913), North America 24% → 9%. Britain had only 7% of world gold, concentrated in Bank of England, while US was absorbing heavy gold flows
- Before WWI's financial problems could be sorted, the Great Depression hit
- **September 19, 1931:** Britain suspended the gold standard completely. Parliament pushed the enabling act through on Monday the twenty-first
- The Gold Standard (Amendment) Act of 1931 was cleverly named — it merely amended the 1925 Act by suspending the Bank's obligation to sell gold. The institution that had lived for 200 years died hard
- **1931-1939:** Gold market price rocketed 82% as nations competed in devaluing currencies. Large movements of monetary gold occurred for political rather than economic reasons
- **1933:** US imposed embargo on gold exports, effectively leaving the gold standard. Then US began buying gold at ever-increasing prices: from $20.67/oz to $35.00/oz by early 1934 (purely to raise domestic prices — it failed)
- **Bretton Woods (July 1944):** Established the International Monetary Fund. The US dollar (defined as 15 5/21 grains of gold, 9/10 fine) became the central monetary unit of the non-Soviet world

### 1948-1976: A Period That Cannot Yet Be Labeled

- **1948:** First free market for gold reopened in Paris; 1952 Swiss removed price ceiling; 1954 London free market reopened
- **1961:** Eight central banks formed the **London Gold Pool** to stabilize the free market at $35.0875 (US gold export point). Modus operandi: buy when price fell, sell when it rose. Succeeded for 4 years
- **1966:** Soviet Union ceased selling gold. Private demand exceeded supply for the first time. Pool members forced to sell from national reserves to maintain price
- **January 1967:** France removed ban on private gold imports → purchases more than doubled. June 1967: France withdrew from the Gold Pool, aggravating the supply-demand imbalance
- By end of 1967, remaining seven central banks had to sell $1.6 billion in bullion to hold London price at $35.20
- **March 17, 1968:** London Gold Pool dissolved. "Two-tier" system created:
  - Tier 1: Official settlements between central banks at $35.00 (closed system)
  - Tier 2: Free market for private buyers at supply/demand prices
- **Gold price then took off on an explosive course unprecedented in monetary history**
- In a single year after 1968, gold prices leaped by an amount equalling the full rise of the Napoleonic Wars — against a background of 200 years of stability

### Table 5: Gold Bullion Supply and Demand, 1948-1975 (metric tons)

Key data points:
- Free world mine production: 702 (1948) → 1,285 (1966) → 951 (1975) — peaked then declined
- Official purchases dominated early years (369 tons in 1948); turned to sales by 1966 (-67 tons)
- Net private purchases surged: 333 (1948) → 2,649 (1967) → 1,125 (1975)
- **1967 was the peak year for private demand: 2,649 metric tons**

### Chart II: Gold Bullion Supply and Demand, 1948-1974

Shows total purchases (solid line) and net private purchases (broken line) against gold price. The dramatic surge in private demand from 1966 onward coincided with the dissolution of the Gold Pool and the explosion in price.

## Chapter 3: Commodity Prices and the Construction of Index Numbers

**Core equation:** GP ÷ CP = PPG (gold price divided by commodity prices = purchasing power of gold)

### Data Sources

- **Primary source:** Lord Beveridge, *Prices and Wages in England from the Twelfth to the Nineteenth Century* (1939) — nearly 170 commodity price series from institutional procurement records
- Before Beveridge, the only collection was Thorold Rogers (7 volumes, 1866-1902, covering 1259-1702), but Rogers had a severe flaw: he combined isolated records from different places and times, building in noncomparability
- **Beveridge's key virtue:** Long price series drawn from a single source — the same documents compiled for the same purpose over time
- Beveridge used only institutional procurement records (from Winchester College, Eton College, Westminster, Charterhouse, Greenwich Hospital, Chelsea Hospital, Navy Victualling, Naval Stores, Office of Works, Lord Stewards' Department, Lord Chamberlain's Department)
- These institutions bought commodities on agreed terms for substantial periods → presumption of comparability over time

### Why Wholesale Prices?

- A cost-of-living index is inappropriate — nobody carries an ounce of gold to a retail market basket
- **Wholesale prices represent the level of trade** meaningful for measuring the purchasing power of a precious metal
- Beveridge collection prices are closer to wholesale than retail

### Commodity Sample Selection

- 16 strata established by the International Scientific Committee on Price History (grain, grain products, livestock, dairy, fish, vegetables, fruit, sugar/spices, miscellaneous foods, drinks, light/fuel, textiles, hides/skins, building materials, metals, chemicals/misc)
- By 1600, commodities found in all strata; by 1660 representation in all except vegetables (first appearing 1671)
- Sample starts with ~12 commodities in 1560, expands to 24 by 1568
- Sample for 1700 listed: ale, bacon, bark, barley, beans, beef, beer, billets, bisquits, bread, broadcloth, butter, candles, canvas, cement, charcoal, cheese, chickens, cloth, coal, cod, cream... ~80+ commodities

### The Construction of Index Numbers

- Chose **average-of-ratios** type (not ratio-of-aggregates)
- Used **geometric mean** (not arithmetic mean) — authority of Irving Fisher's *The Making of Index Numbers* and Wesley Mitchell
- Three advantages of geometric mean (per Mitchell):
  1. Not distorted by asymmetrical distributions (arithmetic mean: 1000+0.1 avg = 505%; geometric: √(1000×0.1) = no change)
  2. Can shift base periods without producing inconsistent results
  3. Closer to the mode of distributions
- **Unweighted** (no consumption data available for 17th-18th centuries) — but Fisher and Mitchell demonstrated that unbiased simple and weighted index numbers usually agree within 5-10%
- Formula: Nth root of the product of all price ratios (P₁/P₀)

### Comparability of Index Numbers Over Long Periods of Time

- Beveridge: "price-history is a study not of isolated facts but of relations; comparison is its essence"
- Going far back into price history is like archeology — "we nurse together the evidence that has survived" and reconstruct what the whole must have been like
- Long-term comparisons are realistic in a "properly qualified sense" — comparisons of widely separated periods have limitations that may not be fully recognized

## Chapter 4: The Purchasing Power of Gold

The purchasing power of gold is how much can be bought with the proceeds of selling an ounce. Calculated by dividing the gold price index by the commodity price index (GP ÷ CP = PPG). Base 1930 = 100.

> "When we talk about the purchasing power of gold (its operational wealth), we mean how much can be purchased with an ounce of gold. This is often overlooked because we are accustomed to thinking of gold, itself, as money. It is not."

### Six Periods of Gold's Purchasing Power

| Period | Characteristics |
|--------|----------------|
| 1560-1700 | Gold and commodity prices both rising; declining trend in gold's purchasing power |
| 1701-1792 | Gold price stable; commodity prices fluctuating on horizontal trend |
| 1793-1821 | Napoleonic Wars |
| 1822-1914 | Gold price stable; commodity prices fluctuating on horizontal long-term trend |
| 1915-1930 | Wildly fluctuating commodity prices; gold prices responsive but in narrower ranges |
| 1931-1976 | Soaring gold prices; commodity price revolution |

### 1560-1700

- Gold price rose 46% from 1570 to 1700; commodity prices rose 72% over same period
- World gold production index (base 1930=100): 1.1 (1561-1600), 1.3 (1601-1640), 1.4 (1641-1680), 1.7 (1681-1700) — tiny compared to later centuries
- The exchange rate between gold and commodities fell ~15% — gold was **not a hedge against inflation** from 1570 to 1700
- Holders of gold (mainly wealthy classes and goldsmiths) saw operational value of holdings diminish

### 1701-1792

- Gold prices almost constant; commodity prices showed no long-term trend upward or downward
- Three distinct commodity price cycles between 1700 and 1790, bottom to bottom: 1700-1737, 1737-1752, 1752-1779
- With gold prices stable, these three commodity price cycles generated exact mirror-image cycles in gold's purchasing power
- **Remarkable finding:** At the midpoints of all three cycles (1718, 1745, 1765), all three series (purchasing power, gold price, commodity prices) converged at a value that was to be the 1930 base — **200 years later**
- This "Retrieval Phenomenon" — commodity prices returning to the gold price level — appears repeatedly in both English and American experience

### 1793-1821 (Napoleonic Wars)

- In 1792 the purchasing power index stood at 104.5. Within 3 years it had fallen by more than 20%. By 1801 it was down almost 40%
- Commodity prices rose 68% by 1801; gold went up too but lagged badly
- Gold went into the wars with a phenomenal record — in 132 years since 1660, it had dipped below 100 only 9 times, and then only marginally
- **The shock:** Within 3 years the rate of exchange of gold for commodities had fallen by more than 20%. By 1801 it was down almost 40%
- As late as 1818 the purchasing power index was hitting about 70 — gold had lost 30% of its prewar purchasing power
- **Gold was decimated as a store of value during the inflation.** It did not regain prewar purchasing power until 1822, and then only briefly. Not until the 1830s was it back in strength
- **But it did come back** — the Retrieval Phenomenon

### 1822-1914

- By 1822 gold price had restabilized at pre-Napoleonic levels. Its purchasing power was also back
- Gold price was the same in 1821 as in 1930 — never greater than 0.7% in between (remarkable stability over a century)
- With gold price constant, purchasing power cycles were pure mirror images of commodity price cycles
- **The great Victorian deflation (1873-1896):** Wholesale prices declined 45% from predepression peak (1873) to trough (1896). This was completely unprecedented in depth and duration since the early 1600s
- Prices were down 35% as early as 1885 and stayed at or below that level until 1905 — 40 years of depressed prices
- **Gold's purchasing power soared** — from 100.8 in 1875, it peaked nearly 60% higher in 1896. The appreciation was steady, not precipitous. Those were good days for people settling accounts in gold

### 1915-1930

- 1915 marked the beginning of the most precipitous drop in purchasing power in gold's history
- From index 113.9 in 1914, purchasing power plummeted to 50.4 in 1918 — losing over half its commodity exchange value in 4 years
- Between 1914 and 1916 alone, the drop was a drastic 37%
- In 1920 England experienced its highest wholesale price level ever to date. **Gold had its lowest exchange rate against commodities in four centuries of recorded history**
- But from that nadir in 1920, recovery was swift. By 1930 purchasing power was back at 100.0

### 1931-1976

- Gold market price had been stable for 6 years preceding 1931. When England left the gold standard, prices took off
- In 4 years gold price sprang upward by two-thirds. Not even the Napoleonic Wars had seen anything like it
- When England entered WWII, gold had more than doubled in price from 1930 (index 220.7 in 1940)
- Post-war: gold index jumped to 319.1 in 1950, remained stable through 1967 (London Gold Pool)
- What had happened to commodity prices? They peaked in 1920, declined to a low in 1933-1935. The net decline peak to trough was 69% — **the most precipitous price decline in all of British history**
- **1930-1933:** For the first time in history, gold and commodity prices moved in opposite directions. Gold went up 47%; commodity prices came down nearly 20%. The conventional wisdom of the money markets required alteration
- **Between 1919 and 1935** — just 16 years — the operational wealth of a stock of gold increased by 287%. The purchasing power went from its lowest point in history to its highest since the mid-sixteenth century
- After 1946, wholesale prices climbed without break to 1248.4 in 1976 (vs 100 in 1930) — surpassing the 1920 record by about 300%
- Since January 1975 gold prices had fallen drastically — for a second time in a generation, gold and commodity prices moved in opposite directions (this time gold declining while commodities soared)

## Chapter 5: The Purchasing Power of Gold in Inflation and Deflation

This chapter reorganizes the chronological data from Chapter 4 into separate episodes of inflation and deflation to find generalizable patterns.

**Definitions used:** "Inflation" = period of rapidly rising prices; "deflation" = interval of swiftly falling prices. These are descriptive terms about price behavior, not about monetary phenomena per se.

### Episodes Identified from Chart I

| Inflationary | Deflationary |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1623-1658 (35 yrs) | 1658-1669 (11 yrs) |
| 1675-1695 (20 yrs) | 1723-1738 (15 yrs) |
| 1702-1723 (21 yrs) | 1813-1851 (38 yrs) |
| 1752-1776 (24 yrs) | 1873-1896 (23 yrs) |
| 1792-1813 (21 yrs) | 1920-1933 (13 yrs) |
| 1897-1920 (23 yrs) | |
| 1934-1976 (43 yrs) | |

**Important caveat:** Earlier inflationary/deflationary episodes should not be equated with modern business cycles. Wesley Mitchell argues the modern business cycle did not appear until the advent of a "money-making" economy. The first treatise on the business cycle was Sismondi's *Nouveaux Principes d'Économie Politique* (1819), itself a product of observing the post-Napoleonic depression.

### 1623-1658: Inflationary, 35 Years

- Commodity prices: +51%; Purchasing power of gold: -34%
- The English Mint was nearly inactive in silver 1610-1630 — coins in circulation were growing worse through clipping and wear
- 1630: Treaty with Spain brought massive influx of Spanish silver to be coined in England. 10 million pounds' worth coined at the Mint between 1630 and 1643 — twice the amount from Elizabeth's entire reign including her great recoinage
- **Monopolies Act of 1624** — allowed monopoly on inventions for a stated number of years. May have been the first patent law, setting the base for England's later technical progress
- Scott's crisis chronology: cloth trade crisis & Dutch competition (1620-25), famine & plague (1630), Charles I's monopolies & depression (1636-37), Charles I's seizure of bullion at the Mint (1640), Civil War exhaustion (1646-49), Dutch War shipping losses (1652-54)
- **Charles I's bullion seizure (1640):** The king blocked 120,000 pounds of silver bullion in the Mint belonging to merchants of Madrid, ordered nothing be paid out. This proved how unsafe a national bank would be under a monarchy — the incident ensured the Bank of England (1694) would be in private hands

### 1658-1669: Deflationary, 11 Years

- Commodity prices: -21%; Purchasing power of gold: +42%
- Charles II took major steps toward a free metallic standard: Thomas Mun's *England's Treasure by Foreign Trade* published 1664, Parliament passed Act for Encouragement of Trade (1663) allowing free export of foreign coins and bullion
- 1663: First milled-edge coins from the Mint — defeating coin clippers
- 1666: Act abolished Mint charges — anyone could bring bullion to be coined free of charge. These provisions remained in force until 1925
- The famous "guinea" was born from a 1663 warrant requiring the Mint to stamp an elephant on all coins from African Company bullion

### 1675-1695: Inflationary, 20 Years

- Commodity prices: +27%; Purchasing power of gold: -21%
- The origin of banking in England: During the Civil War, merchants deposited funds with goldsmiths for safekeeping. Goldsmiths secretly culled heavy coins and melted them, returning only light ones
- Goldsmiths evolved into proto-bankers — accepting deposits, issuing receipts that became negotiable ("cash notes" or "bills"), as early as 1668 per Pepys' *Diary*
- **Exchequer Stoppage (January 2, 1672):** Government stopped paying its old bills, using tax receipts for new war spending. This proved to the commercial world that a national bank must be in private hands, not the clutches of a monarchy
- **Founding of the Bank of England (1694):** William III, deep in debt from war with France, needed money. His government tried everything — lotteries, personal loans, tax increases. Finally, almost as an afterthought, they founded the Bank
- The Bank's charter: lend the government £1,200,000 at 8%. Only £720,000 actually subscribed, but the Bank immediately printed £1,200,000 in sealed bills — **inflation of credit in its simplest, most direct kind**
- The Bank was from the beginning a bank of issue, not merely of deposit. Its first act was inflationary
- Running cash notes ("Speed's Notes" — named after cashier Mr. Speed) circulated freely for the Army by August 1694
- The decade closing this period was a boom: great ferment artistically, financially, and technically. St. Paul's built, Royal Society founded, Hudson Bay Company established. Number of companies in Britain rose from 22 in 1688 to nearly 150 by 1695
- East India Company thriving — capital of 370,000 pounds, paid 100% bonus in 1676. Value of all imports from India increased thirtyfold during the last two Stuarts (1660-1688)

### 1702-1723: Inflationary, 21 Years

- Commodity prices: +25%; Purchasing power of gold: -22%
- Could be combined with 1675-1695 as one long inflation (1675-1723): commodity prices +37%, purchasing power -23%
- Credit currency expanded substantially: (1) engraved private bank notes, (2) bearer's promissory notes, (3) malt tickets used as currency, (4) Exchequer bills as short-term credit
- **Coinage shift:** Between 1700 and 1725, gold coinage at the Mint totaled £11,452,000 vs silver only £557,000 — the preceding 25 years had been roughly equal at 7.5 million each. England had gone on the gold standard effectively in 1717
- Joint-stock companies surged: 140 companies with £4.5M capital in 1695 → total capitalization of nearly £21M by 1717
- **South Sea Bubble (1720):** Chart I registers a fall of 17% in the price index in one year
- England at the time of Queen Anne (1702-1714) was still a thin economy: London had about half a million people, was 14 times the size of the next biggest town, and accounted for one-twelfth of the entire population of ~6 million

### 1723-1738: Deflationary, 15 Years (footnote)

- (Not given a separate detailed section in the text — covered under Chapter 4's 1701-1792 analysis)

### 1752-1776: Inflationary, 24 Years

- Commodity prices: +27%; Purchasing power of gold: -21%
- Associated with the early Industrial Revolution — demand-pull rather than cost-push inflation
- Industrial growth aimed at supplying goods at medium and low prices in large quantity for the increasing population, not luxuries for the wealthy few
- England in 1750 was already distinguished among European counterparts for the variety and prosperity of its industry
- Much industrial development occurred in previously poor and backward districts — explaining why inflation was smooth and gradual (wages were widely dispersed into new hands that weren't prosperous before, not creating heavy pressure on productive capacity)
- In the 50 years following 1760 England was at war more than half the time — constantly financing warfare with deficit spending
- Financial crises: Seven Years' War collapse (1763), banking house failure causing severe panic (1772, worst since South Sea Bubble), American colonial war depression (1776), financial panic (1783)
- **1753 census proposal:** Rejected by Parliament on the ground that it would be "an invasion of privacy and dangerous because it might reveal weakness to an enemy"

### 1792-1813: Inflationary, 21 Years

- Commodity prices: +92%; Purchasing power of gold: -27%
- Heavy industry development prominent after 1780 — "a true revolution of industry" marked by sudden innovations linked with individual names
- This was the most chaotic time in England's economic history for a century before and after — often studied for historical lessons on what can happen when most of the Western world is in turmoil
- England for the first time did not back paper currency with specie (Bank suspended cash payments Feb 1797)
- Thorp's year-by-year chronicle: depression/recession in 1793, 1794, 1797, 1798, 1799, 1800; prosperity in 1792, 1802, 1806, 1809, 1810, 1813. Only 9 of 22 years were designated prosperity
- Climaxed the most rampant price inflation in England until very recent times

### 1813-1851: Deflationary, 38 Years

- Commodity prices: -58%; Purchasing power of gold: +70%
- From the 1813 peak, prices fell abruptly for 3 years then continued a generally downward trend for the next 35 years
- Agricultural prices were already depressed in 1813; manufacturing followed precipitously in 1814 with commercial distress and numerous failures
- Waterloo (June 1815): speculative boom then credit collapse, commodity price decline, many country bank failures
- By 1816 England was in deep depression — iron and coal industries paralyzed, failed wheat and barley harvests, riots from May through December
- **Of the next 35 years Thorp recorded depression, recession, and even panic for 22 of them.** Only 9 were designated as prosperity. The Industrial Revolution had brought something less than economic euphoria
- This was by far the most severe deflation England had ever experienced, in both depth and duration. More than 35 years of declining trend brought prices down to the level of the last quarter of the 17th century
- **Gold's purchasing power increased 70%** — a man with gold saw his operational wealth increase by more than two-thirds. The hard money philosophy of Locke was honored by practice during this time

### 1873-1896: Deflationary, 23 Years

- Commodity prices: -45%; Purchasing power of gold: +82%
- Recession hit in late 1873 with stringent money market and poor wheat harvests. During the next 23 years Thorp found only 4 years he would label prosperity
- Prices reached their low point in the summer of 1896
- The one monetary parameter that held constant was the price of gold — at the Mint price of £3 17s 10.5d where Sir Isaac Newton had put it in 1717. The market price was remarkably stable within half a pence of that until the financial panic of 1893
- **A hoard of gold would exchange for about 80% more commodities in 1896 than 20 years earlier**

### 1897-1920: Inflationary, 23 Years

- Commodity prices: +305%; Purchasing power of gold: -67%
- 1897 marked an abrupt change in British price history — two decades of unbroken decline turned into a rise that culminated 23 years later in a threefold increase
- The rise approximated 40% by 1914, then another 30%+ after the Armistice in 1918. From 1914 to 1918 prices went up 126% — more than wartime inflation; it was based on surging industrial activity and rising economic development
- Gold was no match for commodities. Its operational value was cut by two-thirds in an almost continuous decline. By 1920 gold sank to its lowest rate of exchange for commodities in English history

### 1920-1933: Deflationary, 13 Years

- Commodity prices: -69%; Purchasing power of gold: +251%
- Europe was suffering during all of the 1920s — true of France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, and The Netherlands. England tragically so
- A slump began in summer 1920; a general strike was attempted in May; by September employment was in rapid decline
- Between 1920 and 1933 prices deflated at the highest annual rate in British history for any substantial interval
- Gold responded sharply with commodity price peaking in early 1920. The gold price index had been constant within one decimal point for 90 years. Then between 1918 and 1920 it increased 33%
- Gold was responsive to a commodity price *increase* for the first time in a century

### 1933-1976: Inflationary, 43 Years

- Commodity prices: +1434%; Purchasing power of gold: -25%
- *The Economist* (July 13, 1974): "Apart from a brief period during the Second World War, when the government rigged the official cost-of-living index with subsidies and controls, prices in Britain have not fallen since 1933." The wholesale commodity price index shows the same record
- The most striking aspect: for once gold almost maintained its purchasing power in the face of surging commodity prices
- In 1974, the purchasing power of gold actually stood 1.5% above its level at the start of the inflation in 1933. But in the next two years persistent inflation triumphed and gold fell, so that by 1976 purchasing power was 25% below 1933 levels — *and this during times when gold prices per ounce went to their highest prices in history*

### A Recapitulation of Gold in Inflation and Deflation

**Master summary table — English experience:**

| Inflation | Prices (%) | PPG (%) | | Deflation | Prices (%) | PPG (%) |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 1623-1658 | +51 | -34 | | 1658-1669 | -21 | +42 |
| 1675-1695 | +27 | -21 | | 1813-1851 | -58 | +70 |
| 1702-1723 | +25 | -22 | | 1873-1896 | -45 | +82 |
| 1752-1776 | +27 | -21 | | 1920-1933 | -69 | +251 |
| 1792-1813 | +92 | -27 | | | | |
| 1897-1920 | +305 | -67 | | | | |
| 1933-1976 | +1434 | -25 | | | | |

**Key conclusions from 400 years of English data:**
- **Gold is a poor hedge against major inflation** — it *lost* operational wealth consistently and seriously in every inflationary episode
- **Gold appreciates in operational wealth in major deflations** — in all four pronounced price deflations, gold's purchasing power increased handsomely. Holding gold for 13 years from 1920-1933 would have increased operational wealth 2.5 times
- **Gold is an abysmal hedge against yearly commodity price increases** (short-run). Correlation coefficients for inflation episodes range from -0.52 to -0.99
- **Nevertheless, gold maintains its purchasing power over long periods of time** — the amazing aspect is that this is NOT because gold moves toward commodity prices, but because **commodity prices return to gold** (the "Retrieval Phenomenon")

### The Retrieval Phenomenon

- Commodity prices weave around gold prices but always return to the relationship that held between them in 1930
- As early as 1650, commodity prices had risen to equate with gold. They passed down through in 1660 and rose to touch gold again in 1695
- This pattern repeated: commodity prices falling to or rising to meet the gold price level in 1710, 1740, 1765, 1790, 1820, 1822, 1875, 1915, and 1930
- **For nearly three centuries the level of gold was the loadstone for commodity prices.** Commodity prices traced a pattern of falling and rising around the gold price level, always returning to it before wandering off again

### Purchasing Power at Inflationary Peaks

A curious finding: although gold loses purchasing power *within* inflations, it tends to hold its operational wealth reasonably well from peak to peak:

| Peak Year | PPG Index |
|-----------|----------|
| 1658 | 88 |
| 1695 | 101 |
| 1723 | 98 |
| 1776 | 95 |
| 1813 | 76 |
| 1920 | 79 |
| 1976 | 136 |

At 50-year intervals from 1600 (outside of extended inflation/deflation), gold holds its purchasing power quite well:

| Year | PPG Index |
|------|----------|
| 1600 | 125 |
| 1650 | 97 |
| 1700 | 120 |
| 1750 | 111 |
| 1800 | 76 |
| 1850 | 111 |
| 1900 | 143 |
| 1950 | 103 |

### Chapter 5 Summary (Jastram's words)

- Gold is a poor hedge against major inflation
- Gold appreciates in operational wealth in major deflations
- Gold is an abysmal hedge against yearly commodity price increases
- Nevertheless, gold maintains its purchasing power over long periods of time. The amazing aspect is that this is not because gold moves toward commodity prices but because commodity prices return to gold

## PART II: THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE

---

## Chapter 6: The Evolution of the Gold Standard and Historical Fluctuations in Gold Prices

### A Brief History of the Evolution of the Gold Standard in the United States

- Money was a rarity in early colonial times. Meager specie stock was soon spent on imports. Export of specie from England was forbidden by law
- Settlers turned to sophisticated barter. English government forbade colonial coin production (Massachusetts tried in 1652, Charles II ordered the Mint closed)
- **Foreign currency** — especially Spanish — became the substantial medium. Pirates and privateers contributed. Spanish dollars (corruption of the Germanic "Thaler") were dominant. The separation from England began in the monetary field
- Benjamin Franklin was a great proponent of paper money — saw it as a way to expand trade using only a small base of gold
- The prevalence of paper at the time of the creation of the United States helps explain why gold coins never had the deep symbolic significance in America that they had in some European countries. "The proverbial French peasant and his hoard of buried gold simply did not have an historical counterpart in the colonial freeman"
- New York assembly was first to issue "paper bills of credit" — treasury notes with public receivability. Other colonies followed suit

### Hamilton and the Coinage Act of 1792

- When Washington took office, he appointed his military aide-de-camp Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury — "This seeming bit of military nepotism put Alexander Hamilton in charge of our nascent monetary affairs"
- **Coinage Act of April 2, 1792:** "Act Establishing a Mint and Regulating the Coins of the United States" — drew directly from Hamilton's *Report on the Establishment of a Mint*
- Hamilton considered gold vs silver carefully and recommended a **bimetallic standard** — the dollar would correspond to 24 3/4 grains of pure gold and 371 1/4 grains of pure silver
- Also recommended a decimal system of denomination
- Congress debated whether George Washington's portrait should appear on coins (decided on Liberty instead)
- The bimetallic system worked reasonably well until the Civil War, though Congress constantly haggled over the proper gold-to-silver ratio (set at 15:1 in 1792)

### The Crime of 1873 and the End of Bimetallism

- In the Civil War cataclysm, all banks suspended specie payment by December 30, 1861. The government created legal-tender note issues (greenbacks). The country went on a paper-money standard until January 1, 1879
- While on the paper standard, Congress carried out the 1873 codification of Mint and coinage laws. Few silver coins were in circulation (most had been exported to the Orient). The public was unfamiliar with the silver dollar
- **Congress omitted the silver dollar from its listing of future coins** — no public attention was aroused by the omission. But the legal effect was that **free coinage of silver at the Mint was discontinued**, ending legal bimetallism established in 1792
- When the US returned to specie on January 1, 1879, it discovered it was de facto on a **monometallic gold standard** — gold was the only metal with free coinage privilege (1873 codification)
- Silver supporters called it *The Crime of 1873*. William Jennings Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech gained him the presidential nomination
- J. L. Laughlin's *History of Bimetallism in the United States* (1896) found that experts consulted on the draft bill had indeed pointed out the omission of silver, but Congress was preoccupied with seniorage and salaries of officials

> "One cannot miss the irony that two of the great currencies of history, managed by two of the great democracies, both went onto the gold standard quite successfully without public debate of the portentous issues involved, or indeed without a general awareness of what was taking place."

- **Gold Standard Act of 1900** finally gave formal legal recognition to what had been in effect since January 1, 1879 — "With the haste and impetuosity of which Americans are often accused, the United States gave legal recognition in 21 years to a de facto situation, whereas the more deliberate English had taken a century"

### Historical Fluctuations in Gold Prices (US)

- Chart IV covers the entire period 1800-1976 for gold prices, wholesale commodity prices, and purchasing power of gold
- From the Coinage Act of 1792 until March 10, 1933, the US was on a form of gold standard (jointly with silver or alone). The official gold price was established by Acts of Congress. Market prices were congruent as long as bank notes were redeemable in gold
- The gold price was kept almost constant until the early 1930s — explaining the near-rigid gold price line in Chart IV until 1933
- **March 10, 1933:** President Roosevelt, relying on the Emergency Banking Act, prohibited the export of gold and gold certificates *as well as payments in gold by banks*. The classic gold standard was over
- End of August 1933: Treasury authorized to purchase gold at $29.62/oz (up from $20.67). October 25, 1933: raised to $31.36
- **Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934:** Entirely new basis for the monetary system. No more gold to be coined — all kept in bars. Gold weight of the dollar to be set by the President alone
- Next day, Roosevelt decreed gold = $35.00/fine ounce. But since no gold coins were to be issued and no paper redeemable in gold, it was neither the gold *coin* standard nor the gold *bullion* standard. It was "a new kind of gold standard" — the dollar defined in gold terms but its gold value *managed* by the Treasury
- "After 141 years of relative orthodoxy the United States in one year purposely induced a monetary revolution"

### Tables 6, 7, 8 — US Data (1800-1976)

**Table 6 — Index of the Price of Gold, US (1930=100):**
- 1800-1830: 93.8 (constant — official price)
- 1831-1833: 93.8 (same)
- 1834: 97.0 (slight adjustment)
- 1835-1860: 100.0 (after adjustment to $20.67/oz)
- 1861-1869: Spiked dramatically during greenback era — peak 203.3 in 1864
- 1870-1879: Declined from 114.9 back to 100.0 (resumption of specie payments)
- 1880-1933: 100.0 (gold standard era — utterly constant)

- 1968: 190.0 (two-tier market begins)
- 1970-1976: Explosive rise — 176.1 → 199.6 → 283.4 → 473.2 → 772.7 → 781.5 → 612.3

## Chapter 7: The Purchasing Power of Gold (US)

### The Retrieval Phenomenon in America

- Because gold prices were nearly rigid from 1800-1933, the purchasing power curve is largely a mirror-image of commodity price fluctuations
- **As early as 1802**, the rate of exchange between commodities and gold was the same as it would be 128 years later in 1930. The wholesale commodity price index stood at 100.0 in 1799 and showed **no upward or downward trend all the way to 1930** — a startling revelation for those who assumed US price history was one long upward trend
- There were long swings upward and downward along this steady plane, but the Retrieval Phenomenon discovered in the English experience was repeated: commodity prices always turned back toward the steady level of gold prices

### A Note on International Comparison During Suspension of Specie

- Comparing the Napoleonic period in England (specie suspended Feb 26, 1797) with the Civil War greenback period in the US (specie suspended Dec 1861):
- In both cases, monetary systems were strong before suspension, based on redemption of paper notes by precious metal
- **Chart V** shows the purchasing power of gold behaved almost identically in both countries when gold no longer backed the currency
- In both instances gold *lost* operational wealth when conventional wisdom would have expected it to be a haven
- The time-pattern of loss was very similar despite different eras and circumstances
- In both cases, gold's purchasing power eventually returned to where it had been before suspension — through commodity prices falling back toward gold (the Retrieval Phenomenon)

### Purchasing Power After Specie Payment Resumed

- After 1876, gold price stabilized at $20.67 and held through most of 1933
- Purchasing power became a mirror reflection of commodity price changes
- January 1934: gold set at $35.00/oz — a 60% increase. Commodity prices began to rise too, but much more slowly
- **Between 1934 and 1940** gold's purchasing power was on a plane higher than at any time in American history
- But commodity prices accelerated after 1939. By 1947 the purchasing power of gold was back to 1930 levels — the Retrieval Phenomenon operating on the upward side
- 1947-1970: gold's purchasing power sank steadily as commodity inflation outstripped the fixed $35 gold price
- 1970-1975: gold streaked upward in a phenomenon unparalleled in American history. Purchasing power of gold increased by 180% in 5 years
- But gold peaked in 1975 at 781.5 (index), barely higher than 1974's 772.7. In 1976 it was down to 612.3. Wholesale prices continued to rise inexorably

### US Inflationary and Deflationary Episodes

| Inflationary | Deflationary |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1808-1814 (6 yrs) | 1814-1830 (16 yrs) |
| 1843-1857 (14 yrs) | 1864-1897 (33 yrs) |
| 1861-1864 (3 yrs) | 1929-1933 (4 yrs) |
| 1897-1920 (23 yrs) | |
| 1933-1951 (18 yrs) | |
| 1951-1976 (25 yrs) | |

### 1808-1814: Inflationary, 6 Years
- Commodity prices: +58%; Purchasing power of gold: -37%
- War with England threatened from 1807; trade restrictions severe by 1808; coast paralyzed, inland stagnation by 1809
- Abnormally small wheat crop in 1809 sent prices sharply upward — the thin US economy was hyperreactive to supply shocks
- Closure of the US Bank in 1811 further weakened confidence
- Britain declared war June 1812, laid absolute blockade. Prices continued to soar until peace in December 1814

### 1814-1830: Deflationary, 16 Years
- Commodity prices: -50%; Purchasing power of gold: +100%
- Imports flooded in after 1815. Second US Bank organized mid-1816 but couldn't prevent widespread financial difficulties by 1818
- Collapse of speculation in slave markets of the South added to economic difficulties
- Vast public lands were not an unmitigated blessing — speculative purchasing and forced selling created credit shortages
- Jackson elected 1828; his message of hostility to the US Bank in December 1830 confirmed fears of the business community
- **Holders of gold did very well — operational wealth doubled just by standing pat**

### 1843-1857: Inflationary, 14 Years
- Commodity prices: +48%; Purchasing power of gold: -33%
- Prosperity gradually swelled, general by 1845. Railroad speculation and wheat speculation rife
- 1846: War with Mexico declared. Gold discovered in California in January 1848. Influx of California gold bullion felt in the East by 1850
- 1854: Trade with Japan opened. Same factors swelled economy through most of 1857
- Commodity prices rose almost half; holders of gold lost one-third of operational wealth

### 1861-1864: Inflationary, 3 Years
- Commodity prices: +117% (annual rate +39%!); Purchasing power of gold: -6.2% only
- The Civil War / greenback period. Suspension of specie payment and flood of unsupported paper money
- Gold price doubled by 1864 (index 203.3) but commodity prices went up even faster
- Gold almost held its purchasing power in this case — only -6.2% decline — because its market price was free to respond
- Gold did far better than greenbacks, which were a national disaster

### 1864-1897: Deflationary, 33 Years
- Commodity prices: -65%; Purchasing power of gold: +40%
- The postwar depression was tragic and prolonged, though 1880-1885 were comparatively good
- Lee surrendered April 1865. Lincoln assassinated the same month. The South was in economic chaos — complete collapse of currency and government finance
- As early as 1866: slackening of trade in the North. Dreary economic record until resumption of specie payment in 1879
- 1880-1885 comparatively good, but even in 1884 numerous bank failures; clearing house certificates employed
- Labor strife severe: Anti-Chinese riots (1885), Knights of Labor railroad strike (1886), "Haymarket Massacre" in Chicago
- 1893: extreme depression; business failures prevalent; railroads went into receiverships. 1894: deep depression; bituminous coal strikes; Coxey's armies marched. 1896: intense depression; commodity prices hit bottom in 1897
- **Operational wealth would have increased by 40% if gold had been held for this extended 33-year period** and the temptation to liquidate had been resisted

### 1897-1920: Inflationary, 23 Years
- Commodity prices: +232%; Purchasing power of gold: -70%
- In the 1890s business cycles began to take on an international pattern
- US prosperity returned in 1898. Short war with Spain (April–August); Philippines and Hawaiian Islands acquired. Immigration boom began 1899
- 1900-1901: great prosperity; records for industrial production. U.S. Steel Corporation formed 1901 — achievement of large-scale industry
- 1903: numerous labor troubles; 1905: great expansion with iron and steel in the vanguard. Railroad freight congestion was a new phenomenon of prosperity
- **Panic of 1907:** Knickerbocker Trust Company failure; banks suspended payments; stock exchange collapsed. 1908: depression
- 1913: Income Tax Amendment ratified — "surely no one then realized what a business force this was to become"
- Curiously, the first year of WWI (1915) was a time of depression in the US; foreign trade fell off drastically. But by 1915 war industries led to recovery; exports increased enormously
- **Operational wealth of gold fell by 70 percent** in this period

### 1929-1933: Deflationary, 4 Years
- Commodity prices: -31%; Purchasing power of gold: +44%
- Unlike England, which saw a tremendous drop in 1920-21 then steady prices, the US saw prices hold through the 1920s — deflation only from 1929
- **October 1929:** Collapse of the NYSE. The spectacular stock market behavior had disguised the underlying economic deterioration
- **Bank failures:** 24,079 banks at start of 1930; 1,352 suspended that year. 2,294 failures in 1931; 1,456 in 1932; 408 more in early 1933 alone
- Late 1931: second shock — foreign and fundamental. European countries (Austria, Germany, England, France) couldn't meet debts. Gold standards abandoned. National currencies disarranged. ~$2 billion of American investments abroad became worthless
- Glass-Steagall Act (Feb 1932): allowed government bonds as collateral for Federal Reserve notes instead of commercial paper
- Between February 1933 and Roosevelt's inauguration (March 4), $624 million in gold withdrawn from Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks
- **March 6, 1933:** Roosevelt declared nationwide bank holiday. After reopenings, public confidence was restored — bank withdrawals were redeposited
- "Gold was a very good way to have held wealth from 1929 until that time, not as a protection against *inflation* — because quite the opposite was happening — but because operational wealth was thereby enhanced"
- **People rushed to gold not to protect from price inflation, but because of what Jastram calls the "Attila Effect"** (discussed in Chapter 8)

### 1933-1951: Inflationary, 18 Years
- Commodity prices: +168%; Purchasing power of gold: -37%
- **Gold Reserve Act (Jan 30, 1934):** Gold coinage discontinued. All gold to be kept in bars as property of the US government. Gold weight of the dollar could be redefined by presidential proclamation alone
- Roosevelt set gold at $35.00/oz (15 5/21 grains of gold 9/10 fine). Dollar depreciation: 40.94%
- No gold coin standard (no coins), no gold bullion standard (no paper redeemable in gold). But a *kind* of gold standard — the dollar exclusively defined in terms of gold, with gold value managed by the Treasury
- Roosevelt's short-run purpose (stimulating commodity prices) failed — discussed by Galbraith in *Money*, Chapters XIV and XV
- Gold's purchasing power held up rather well until 1940, then suffered continuous erosion as commodity prices rose to 1951. Between 1940 and 1951 purchasing power fell 56%
- "Gold would have been a dismal holding for a United States citizen as a wartime haven for his wealth"

### 1951-1976: Inflationary, 25 Years
- Commodity prices: +101%; Purchasing power of gold: +80%
- **Two distinct sub-periods:**
  - **1951-1970 (19 years):** Commodity prices +21%, purchasing power of gold -14%. Typical pattern — inflation erodes gold's value
  - **1970-1976 (6 years):** Commodity prices +66%, purchasing power of gold **+110%**. Unprecedented reversal!
- Until 1970, the four-century pattern held: commodity prices up, gold purchasing power down
- **From 1970-1975:** Wholesale commodity prices went up 58%, yet purchasing power of gold shot up *180%*. A unique reversal. Why? The dissolution of the London Gold Pool in 1968 and the two-tier market. Gold was finally free to be priced by supply and demand

### A Recapitulation of Gold in Inflation and Deflation (US)

**Master summary table — American experience:**

| Inflation | Prices (%) | PPG (%) | | Deflation | Prices (%) | PPG (%) |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 1808-1814 | +58 | -37 | | 1814-1830 | -50 | +100 |
| 1843-1857 | +48 | -33 | | 1864-1897 | -65 | +40 |
| 1861-1864 | +117 | -6 | | 1929-1933 | -31 | +44 |
| 1897-1920 | +232 | -70 | | | | |
| 1933-1951 | +168 | -37 | | | | |
| 1951-1976 | +101 | +80 | | | | |

**Inflation rates table (US):**

| Years | Duration | Net Change (%) | Simple Annual Rate (%) | Compound Annual Rate (%) |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1808-1814 | 6 | +58 | +9.7 | +7.9 |
| 1843-1857 | 14 | +48 | +3.4 | +2.8 |
| 1861-1864 | 3 | +117 | +39.0 | +29.5 |
| 1897-1920 | 23 | +232 | +10.1 | +5.4 |
| 1933-1951 | 18 | +168 | +9.3 | +5.6 |
| 1951-1976 | 25 | +101 | +4.0 | +2.8 |

**Deflation rates table (US):**

| Years | Duration | Net Change (%) | Simple Annual Rate (%) | Compound Annual Rate (%) |
|-------|----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1814-1830 | 16 | -50 | -3.1 | -4.2 |
| 1864-1897 | 33 | -65 | -2.0 | -3.1 |
| 1929-1933 | 4 | -31 | -7.8 | -8.9 |

**Key observations:**
- Since 1800 the US has had many more years of inflation than deflation (88 vs 58)
- Twice as many periods of inflation as deflation
- Most recent deflation (1929-1933) was the shortest, sharpest, and most severe in annual rate
- In five out of six major inflationary episodes since the 18th century, gold has lost purchasing power (and quite severely in four of those five)
- The one exception: 1951-1976, where the freed gold market after 1970 allowed gold to outrun commodities
- **No exceptions** for deflation: in all three cases, gold's purchasing power appreciated handsomely

### Purchasing Power at Widely-Spaced Intervals (US)

| Year | PPG Index |
|------|----------|
| 1802 | 101.1 |
| 1820 | 111.5 |
| 1836 | 110.6 |
| 1855 | 114.7 |
| 1865 | 107.3 |
| 1874 | 111.2 |
| 1882 | 116.7 |
| 1916 | 101.1 |
| 1927 | 90.5 |
| 1947 | 98.7 |
| 1972 | 106.1 |

- Purchasing power of gold moved along a **horizontal plane for 170 years** of American history — remarkable constancy

### Purchasing Power in the Short Run (US)

- Correlation coefficients between year-to-year changes in commodity prices and purchasing power:

**Inflations:** 1808-1814: r = -0.96; 1843-1857: r = -0.97; 1861-1864: r = -0.37; 1897-1920: r = -0.82; 1933-1951: r = -0.54; 1951-1975: r = +0.70

**Deflations:** 1814-1830: r = -0.92; 1864-1897: r = -0.42; 1929-1933: r = -0.96

- All but one are significant at the 10% level; most reach the 5% level. The one exception is r = -0.37 for the Civil War years (only 3 data points — null hypothesis cannot be rejected)
- **"In all other instances the evidence is compelling that gold is indeed a poor hedge against annual price fluctuations"**

### Chapter 7 Summary

The conclusions from the American experience are very much like those based on the English analysis:
1. Gold is a poor hedge against major inflations
2. Gold appreciates in operational wealth in major deflations
3. Gold is an ineffective hedge against yearly commodity price increases
4. Nevertheless, gold does maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time. The intriguing aspect is that this is not because gold eventually moves toward commodity prices but because **commodity prices return to gold**

## Chapter 8: Reflections on the Golden Constant

This chapter contains Jastram's personal reflections — hypotheses and impressions formed during the research, not susceptible to formal testing but "of possible interest and use to the reader."

### The Attila Effect

- Something deeper than conscious thought — "perhaps a race-memory" — distorts our perspective on gold. Gold is entwined with two primordial needs: **the imperative to survive** and **the desire to possess and enjoy beauty**
- Primitive man found shining pebbles in streams, carried them to shelter. "They were responsive to his touch, and were easily worked into adornments that never corroded and were coveted by others"
- When the Four Horsemen galloped, a stock of gold pieces has often meant the difference between living and dying. Gold became synonymous with security and safety in folk wisdom
- **The Attila Effect:** Gold has historically served as a financial refuge in political, economic, and personal catastrophes:
  - The Latifundia passed gold bars to heirs who survived barbarian invasions to become Merovingian nobility
  - White Russians who escaped the Bolsheviks survived on treasures carried in flight
  - Austrian refugees escaping Hitler's storm troopers owed survival to gold and jewels on their persons
- The French peasant was astute to bury gold coins against invasion and pillage. But **to extrapolate from gold's protection in singular catastrophes to its use as a strategy against cyclical inflation is faulty inductive reasoning**
- "This is the lesson my statistics have taught me"

### Gold as a Hedge Against Inflation

- Andre Sharon (Drexel Burnham): "the value of gold essentially derives from its capacity to preserve real capital and purchasing power"
- Jastram: This proposition is contrary to statistical fact, but widely believed. Why? Because gold *has* preserved capital in cataclysmic cases (Attila Effect). To extrapolate that to routine inflation protection is "an example of faulty inductive reasoning"

### The Retrieval Phenomenon

- Gold is not a satisfactory hedge against inflation but does very well in deflation because **gold does not match commodity prices in their cyclical swings**
- Over the long run (periods longer than price cycles), gold maintains its purchasing power remarkably well
- This is NOT because gold moves toward commodity prices — it is because **commodity prices return to gold**
- Gold prices do not chase after commodities; commodity prices return to the index level of gold over and over. This is one of the principal findings of the study
- As a statistician, Jastram cannot fully account for the Retrieval Phenomenon, but his feeling is that it is beyond rational belief that it could occur by chance alone over three centuries
- **If the price of gold is held constant by national policy**, then commodity prices will sometimes fall below and sometimes rise above that constant level. When swings become severe, monetary authorities intervene and adjust the monetary supply, tending to return commodity prices toward the constant gold price — **not because it is gold, but because it is constant**
- This assumes fairly sophisticated monetary economics on the part of authorities. The first appearance of the Retrieval Phenomenon is about 1650, and it shows repeatedly in the 18th century. The Bullion Committee testimony (p. 46) reveals that 18th-century monetary authorities had "neither the perspicacity nor the sense of obligation to manage the level of commodity prices"

> "Gold prices do not chase after commodities; commodity prices return to the index level of gold over and over."

### The Gold Nostalgia

- There is a romanticized nostalgia about the gold standard: "things weren't like this when our money was tied to gold"
- This is **demonstrably erroneous** — there were serious unemployments and pronounced inflations in both England and the US when the classic gold standard prevailed. Some of the worst depressions in British history occurred under the gold-coin standard
- **Two major types of gold standard:** the *gold-coin* standard (used in England 1717-1925, US until Roosevelt's 1933 proclamation) and the *gold-bullion* standard (convertibility only at stipulated minimum amounts)
- There is also the *gold-exchange* standard — of theoretical interest with occasional actual application
- **Essential characteristics of the gold-coin standard:**
  1. All money held at parity defined by gold content, convertible into gold coin on demand
  2. The monetary unit is coined freely without appreciable charge
  3. Gold coins circulate freely — may be exported, imported, or melted
  4. Gold is unlimited legal tender
  5. Gold constitutes a large part of the central monetary reserve
- **Four pressure points where governments interfere** with any gold standard:
  1. Paper currency doesn't have 100% gold reserve — a fractional reserve is a government manipulation (can change the percentage at will)
  2. The world gold price may change drastically (as in the 1970s), inflating admissible paper currency or reducing the reserve ratio
  3. If gold is to be held constant by the marketplace, government must buy/sell in quantities it precisely decides, or adjust interest rates
  4. If gold is to be held constant by edict, the market must be interdicted — exports forbidden, imports embargoed, private hoardings outlawed
- **"Any monetary system needs to be managed. The real questions are how and to what extent."**
- The gold standard as a "dehumanized, self-disciplining dispenser of monetary justice" is a myth

### More Nostalgia

- Dr. Miller (Federal Reserve Board member) testified to Congress in 1927: "The gold standard, to my mind, means a device which acts as a kind of regulating and levelling influence... never consciously thought out, not consciously invented by anybody, but the growth of experience of the great commercial countries of the world"
- This lyrical laissez-faire vision never did hold, and would not now

### The Level of Prices in the Very Long Run

- People today believe prices were cheaper in their parents' day and far cheaper for their grandparents — this happens to be true when looking at 1880-1910 (30 years of depressed prices) and the 1930s
- However, people then extrapolate backwards and conclude prices have been on one long upward trend — **this is far wide of the mark**
- The price of four pounds of wheaten bread was a shade higher in London in 1767-1768 than in 1934
- Money wage rates of manual workers increased by **4,600%** between 1700 and 1972 in London
- Since goods prices were not rising anywhere near proportionally, "real wages" rose enormously — an increase of **695%** by rough approximation. *An ounce of gold just about held its purchasing power over these centuries, but the value of an hour's labor increased sevenfold*
- The "price revolution" of the 16th century looks imposing on a chart, but 1540-1560 compound rate was only 3.6% per year
- The 1623-1658 inflationary period (35 years) had a compound rate of only 1.2%

### What is the Future?

- The major trading nations will not return to the gold standard, whether coin or bullion, despite nostalgia and wishful thinking
- Without arguing the merits, Jastram foresees a further moving of gold out of monetary systems, and with that, greater flexibility and an increasingly unfettered market
- This is not to say the market will be self-corrective through usual demand/supply models — gold's demand and supply functions are far more complicated

### Demand

- Fabrication demand is overlaid by a strong speculative component especially sensitive to inflation or its prospect
- Gold as a commodity for fabrication rises with inflation along with other metals — if it goes up 5%, it may go up another 5% as speculators rush to buy before further inflation hits
- **A rise in gold prices may not dampen demand but actually stimulate it** — the popular reputation of gold as an inflation hedge creates a self-fulfilling cycle
- Gold has a **high elasticity of expectations**: the ratio of expected to present price increases is high, so the speculative motive feeds on itself
- Demand for gold is sensitive not just to the level of inflation but to **changes in the rate** of inflation — gold fell from $197.50 to $103.50 (Dec 1974 to summer 1976) not because inflation ceased but because the *rate* of increase had fallen
- A sudden decrease in gold's price tends to have a **multiplier effect downward** — speculators rush to liquidate, accelerating the fall

### Supply

#### Mine Production
- 1970-1975: ~77% of total free-world production came from South Africa
- South African policy: mine the *lowest grade ore* profitable at prevailing price. With ore mining capacity subject to physical limits, the quantity of *gold* produced falls as the gold price rises — a **"backward-rising" supply curve**, rare in commodity markets
- The practical effect: South African mine gold production *decreased* every year from 1970 to 1975, while the average price received *rose* from $36 to $154
- ~10% of free-world gold production is a by-product of base metal mining, more dependent on base metal market factors than on gold price
- Rest of Africa held constant; Latin America increased; Asia fell moderately; US and Canada fell progressively. Net effect: 25% decrease in mined supply during the 5 years when gold prices rose — unprecedented in history

#### Above-Surface Stocks
- Two forms: central bank/IMF stocks, and private investor/speculator stocks
- Central bank and IMF sales are **price-affective rather than price-reactive** — they defy analysis in terms of market price
- Hoarding/dishoarding from private stocks is influenced by available price but difficult to generalize
- The speculative demand component makes prediction of gold's course in the short term very difficult
- **Russia** is a last source of uncertainty — her gold stocks are very large, and she might make major moves out of non-economic motivations, affecting the world price unpredictably

### The Golden Constant

- As far back as anthropologists have studied cultural organizations, gold has appeared as a constant for the appreciation of beauty, the storage of riches, or the exchange of goods and services
- Gold has two interesting properties: it is cherished and it is indestructible. It is never cast away and never diminishes except by outright loss. It can be melted but never changes its chemistry or weight. "The ring worn today may contain particles mined at the time of the Pharaohs"
- In this book we discover the stability of gold in yet another context: **its price has been remarkably similar for centuries at a time. Its purchasing power in the middle of the twentieth century was very nearly the same as in the midst of the seventeenth century**
- There is no intent to define "constant" in the scientific sense of a mathematical parameter. "The concept is at once too universal and too elusive for that. As with gold itself, the title may mean different things to different people"

> "Gold has two interesting properties: it is cherished and it is indestructible. It is never cast away and it never diminishes... The ring worn today may contain particles mined at the time of the Pharaohs."

## PART III: AFTER THE GOLD PRICE WAS FREED, 1971-2007

## Chapter 9: The Gold Market and the Purchasing Power of Gold, 1971-2007

*By Jill Leyland*

### Introduction

- The changes in the market price of gold and in its purchasing power in the last 30+ years of the 20th century have **no counterpart in monetary history**
- For more than 250 years, the market price of gold had been anchored to the currency of a large country (first Britain, then the US). After 1971, currencies were no longer defined in terms of gold, and gold was free to float like any other commodity
- Jastram wrote his book in the early 1970s — the two additional chapters by Leyland assess whether his conclusions still hold for the post-1971 period
- **Chapter 9** follows Jastram's analytical steps for 1971-2007. **Chapter 10** broadens the analysis: sets 1971-2007 in longer-term historical context, looks at four other countries (France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland), and assesses the extent to which Jastram's conclusions still hold

### Methodology Adaptations

- The entire period from end of WWII to 2007 has been inflationary, so Leyland divides into three subperiods:
  1. **1971-1980:** High inflation, gold prices rose to exceptional levels
  2. **1981-2000:** Disinflation (falling inflation), gold prices fell or were broadly stable
  3. **2001-2007:** Generally low inflation, but inflationary fears re-awaken with rising oil and commodity prices; gold price recovers
- These periods fit neatly with gold price trends: upward in the 1970s, falling/stable in the 1980s-1990s, recovery from 2001

### Price Indices

- Leyland will use wholesale prices (now called "producer prices") for consistency with Jastram, but will also consider consumer prices
- **Table 9** — Wholesale vs. consumer price growth comparison:
  - US 1800-1930: wholesale -2.4%, consumer -2.0% (nearly identical)
  - US 1930-1970: wholesale +148.2%, consumer +132.6% (similar)
  - US 1970-2007: wholesale +367.8%, consumer +434.1% (substantial divergence)
  - UK 1800-1930: wholesale -38.7%, retail +28.1% (different)
  - UK 1970-2007: wholesale +651.5%, retail +1,014.9% (major divergence)
- The divergence from 1970 onward matters because wholesale prices exclude services, which have become a much larger part of the economy
- Leyland will use Retail Price Index for UK (available back to 1750) and Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI for US

### The Lead-up to 1971

- 1951-1970 was continuous inflation — the fixed $35/oz gold parity became increasingly unrealistic
- Mining costs grew, making gold mining uneconomical; gold jewelry became increasingly attractive in real terms; fixed Bretton Woods parities caused economic strains in the 1960s
- US balance of payments deficit, exacerbated by Vietnam War, caused gold to flow from US to European countries and Japan. US reserves fell sharply
- Late 1950s: measures adopted to reduce dollar flow to foreign parties; US citizens prohibited from owning gold outside the US (extension of 1934 prohibition)
- London Gold Pool established 1961 to manage private market gold price near official parity
- 1950s-early 1960s: aggregate gold holdings of monetary authorities and international financial institutions increased from 31,100 tonnes ($35B) to 38,300 tonnes ($43B at end of 1965)
- Private demand exceeded production — London Gold Pool became net seller in 1966. Holdings declined by $70M in 1966, $1.6B in 1967 (after British pound devaluation), $0.8B in first 10 weeks of 1968
- **March 17, 1968:** Gold Pool members announced they would no longer sell to private parties — **"two-tier" market created.** Central banks trade at $35; private market floats freely
- **August 15, 1971:** US Treasury announced it would no longer sell gold to foreign central banks — Nixon closed the gold window. Also imposed 10% tariff surcharge on imports, price/wage ceilings
- Mid-December 1971: Smithsonian Agreement — new currency parities with wider bands; US gold parity raised to $38; dollar devalued 12% vs. other industrial currencies
- February 1973: Bundesbank stopped buying dollars; adjustable parities collapsed; US dollar gold parity raised to $42.22 (though US Treasury would not buy or sell)
- **November 13, 1973:** Two-tier system formally closed — had been moribund since August 1971

### Changes in the Gold Market, 1971-2007

- After August 1971, gold was no longer an anchor for the international financial system
- Gold price soared in the 1970s: reached $512/oz on last trading day of 1979, peaked at **$850 on January 21, 1980**
- Then fell sharply until late 1982 ($457), fluctuated around a slowly declining trend until early 2001
- **Trough: $256 on April 2, 2001**
- Then entered an upward trend, passing the January 1980 peak in January 2008, touching **$1,000/oz in March 2008**

#### Supply Changes
- 1970s surge led to short-run decline but long-run increase in production via technological advances (heap leaching, roasting, autoclaving) enabling extraction from lower-grade ores
- **South Africa's share dropped from 70% (1970) to 17% (2000)** — mining became a global industry
- By 2007 Chinese production thought to have just exceeded South Africa's
- Production peaked 2001, then declined due to financial strain from low 1990s prices, reduced exploration, environmental constraints
- **Forward selling** by mining companies to bullion banks (1980s-2000s) accelerated supply; after 2000, mining companies collectively reduced forward positions, reducing supply to private sector

#### Central Bank Sales
- US auctioned 1.3M oz (40 tonnes) in 1975, and more in 1978 and 1979
- IMF disposed of ~1/3 of its gold
- Bank of Canada gradually sold nearly all holdings over 23 years starting early 1980s
- Belgium (1989), then Austria, Australia, Argentina, Netherlands sold
- 1997: Swiss plans to sell half their substantial holdings
- **May 1999:** UK announced sale of 415 tonnes over 5 years — caused substantial fears of a tidal wave of central bank selling
- **September 1999: Central Bank Gold Agreement (Washington Agreement)** — ECB banks, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England, Swedish central bank agreed to sell no more than 2,000 tonnes over 5 years (max ~400/year). Agreed not to expand gold leasing, futures, options. **Effectively ended market concern** over central bank selling
- March 2004: renewed agreement, raised annual limit to 500 tonnes
- Central bank sales averaged ~20% of annual mine production in recent years

#### Demand Changes
- Deregulation: US lifted private ownership ban in January 1975; India liberalized in 1990s; China gradually deregulated in early 2000s
- **Gold bullion coins** (krugerrand 1967, American Eagle, Canadian Maple Leaf) — marketed as pure investment coins at ruling price plus small premium
- **Gold ETFs** (from 2003) — effectively shares backed by gold, tracking price closely. Accounted for 7% of identifiable demand by 2007. Transferred over 1,000 tonnes from central bank reserves to private investors (per Lassonde's Foreword)
- Jewelry = dominant demand: ~70% of fabrication by 2000-2007. India and China emerged as dominant consumers
- Developing countries overtook developed countries in jewelry buying
- Electronics industry: gold's electrical conductivity, ductility, and corrosion resistance make it prime for connectors
- Jewelry-buying habits in the developing world differ from the West: in Asian and Middle Eastern countries, gold jewelry is sold by weight at a price tracking the international gold price, with low markup. Often 18-carat (75% gold) or higher — 21-carat (Arabian peninsula), 22-carat (India), 24-carat pure gold (China)
- In these countries, gold jewelry is both adornment and savings — common to trade in pieces already owned when buying new. Jewellery can be sold for profit when price rises, making scrap supply very responsive to price
- **Demand tends to fall sharply when price is rising but return when perceived as reasonably stable, even at a higher level**

### 1971-2007 Subperiod Analysis

### 1970-1980: High Inflation, 10 Years

- The 1970s gold price surge was partly a response to being maintained at below-market level during the 1960s — the market was moving toward its long-run equilibrium price
- **May 1972:** South Africa and USSR temporarily stopped selling gold
- **Early 1973:** News of substantial US trade deficit for 1972 provoked speculation against the dollar; dollar devaluation to $42.22/oz announced (although market price already substantially higher)
- **March 1973:** Central banks temporarily suspended foreign exchange dealings; adopted floating exchange rate regimes
- **October 6, 1973:** Egypt and Syria attacked Israel (Yom Kippur War). October 17: OPEC oil embargo to nations supporting Israel — **first oil price shock**, sharp rise in inflation, lowered confidence in paper money. Gold price continued upward until late 1974
- US inflation eased in 1975-1976; January 1975 restrictions on US citizens holding gold lifted; G10 agreed to freeze monetary gold stocks and IMF to reduce holdings by one-third (auctions started June 1976). Gold prices fell from end of 1974 to 1976, then started rising again
- **1977-1978:** Inflation returned; growing concern over falling dollar value. Gold price rose, passing previous peak in early 1978
- **1979:** Iranian revolution — **second oil price shock**. Iranian hostage crisis (66 US diplomats/nationals). Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Dollar falling to record lows, high oil prices, rampant inflation
- Gold price soared in volatile market — briefly reached **$850/oz on January 21, 1980**, a record to stand for 28 years
- 1980 annual average: **$614.50/oz** — over 17× the 1970 average of $35.95
- **US results:** Wholesale prices +143%, purchasing power of gold +602%
- **UK results:** Wholesale prices +201%, purchasing power of gold +483%
- **Key difference from Jastram's findings:** When the gold price was fixed, gold *lost* purchasing power during inflation. Now with gold free to float, it *gained* massively during high inflation — **a fundamental reversal**
- Jastram himself noticed this tendency in 1970-1975 but was writing too early to confirm it
- The 1980 peak in gold's purchasing power was easily a record. In the UK, it was over 50% higher than the previous highest peak in Jastram's analysis (1562). In the US, it was 2.5× the previous highest peak (1934)

### 1980-2000: Disinflation, 20 Years

- **October 1979:** Federal Reserve adopted severely contractionary monetary policy under Volcker. Followed by most governments including Thatcher's UK (raised interest rates, deflationary budget in 1981 during recession)
- Helped by recession and later fall in oil prices, inflation declined sharply in both countries during first half of 1980s — not entirely conquered until 1990s (UK saw resurgence in late 1980s)
- **1980s economic problems:** International debt crisis triggered by Mexico's mid-1982 default; many developing countries struggled with dollar-denominated debt and high interest rates. Some made distress sales of gold in 1983
- Dollar rose to levels considered uncomfortably high, leading to **Plaza Accord (1985)** — five major countries agreed to intervene to depreciate the dollar. Dollar's subsequent fall led to **Louvre Accord (1987)**. **October 1987: Black Monday** — sharp fall in global stock markets
- Gold price remained fairly volatile in early 1980s: initial fall in 1981 stimulated jewelry/fabricated demand; international debt crisis helped recovery in 1982; speculative demand added. But physical demand not strong enough to sustain recovery
- Late 1980s-1996: gold price in a relatively narrow range
- 1989: Communism collapsed in central Europe. 1991: USSR break-up. 1992: European exchange rate perturbations. Little impact on dollar gold price
- **From 1989:** Official sector became consistent net seller of gold; mine production continued to increase; forward selling by mining companies increased — rising supply worsened the price picture
- Late 1990s: **"perfect storm" for gold** — inflation subdued, global economy growing, stock markets booming ("irrational exuberance"), dollar strengthening, central bank selling concerns growing, mining output and forward sales increasing
- **1997-98 Asian crisis** provoked distress selling (South Korea's national gold collection campaign — citizens turned in jewelry, bars, coins for won-denominated bonds). Scrap supply soared
- **Low point: July 1999** (US dollar). September 1999 Central Bank Gold Agreement brought temporary relief, but price headed down again until early 2001
- **US results (1980-2000):** Wholesale prices +48% (sharp deceleration from 143% in prior decade), gold's purchasing power **-69%**. On consumer price basis: prices +109%, purchasing power **-78%**
- **UK results (1980-2000):** Wholesale prices +121%, purchasing power **-69%**. Consumer prices +155%, purchasing power **-73%**
- These falls in purchasing power look substantial but came from a very high peak — even at the lowest point, gold's purchasing power was still higher than in other recent troughs

### 2000-2007: Inflation Fears Revived

- Strong economic growth, largely thanks to China, India emerging on the world stage
- But characterized by uneasiness: growth built on rising debt (leading to 2007 financial crisis start); dollar weakened; rising oil and commodity prices spurred by rapid growth in China and emerging markets reawakened inflation fears
- Global imbalances: persistent balance of payments surplus in high-savings countries (Eurozone, Asia, Russia, Middle East energy exporters) mirrored by persistent deficit in US and a few others
- **2000:** Stock markets fell; 2001 sharp economic slowdown; **September 11, 2001:** terrorist attacks changed global situation overnight
- **2002:** Dollar started to weaken
- Meanwhile, autonomous supply of gold constrained: central bank sales limited by Gold Agreement; mining companies reduced forward positions from 2001; mine output stagnated/declined slightly despite rising price (few major discoveries, long lead times)
- **Investors took renewed interest:** stimulated by economic/political background, inflation fears, new gold ETFs (from 2003), jewelry demand revival
- Gold price passed the 1980 peak in January 2008, touching **$1,000/oz in March 2008**
- **US results (2000-2007):** Wholesale prices +30%, purchasing power of gold **+92%**
- **UK results (2000-2007):** Wholesale prices +13%, purchasing power of gold **+67%**
- By 2007 purchasing power had nearly doubled in US dollar terms from 2000, risen by two-thirds in UK terms

## Chapter 10: Further Explorations into the Gold Price and its Purchasing Power

*By Jill Leyland*

### Price Levels in the Twentieth Century

- The 20th century was unique: price increases were much more rapid than ever before
- **Table 11 — Consumer price levels (1900 = 100):**
  - US: 1900=100, 1935=164, 1965=378, 2000=2,063, 2007=2,484
  - UK: 1900=100, 1935=173, 1965=635, 2000=7,302, 2007=8,859
- By 2000, US prices were over 20× their 1900 level; UK prices over 70×
- 19th century fluctuations were dwarfed by 20th century changes — especially the massive rise starting ~1940, accelerating in the 1970s
- UK inflation was notably faster than US, especially in the second half of the century

### Purchasing Power of Gold in Historical Context (1800-2007)

- Chart XVI shows purchasing power of gold (based on consumer prices) for US and UK, 1800-2007
- For much of the 19th century after the Napoleonic wars, purchasing power was broadly stable in both countries
- It declined after WWI as prices rose but gold remained fixed at pre-war level
- By 1934, gold's purchasing power was roughly the same as at century's beginning — the price increase in 1934 more or less matched the increase in the general price level since the end of WWI
- Purchasing power then declined mid-century as post-WWII prices surged while gold stayed pegged at $35/oz
- **1970s-early 1980s:** Purchasing power soared in both currencies
- **1980s-1990s:** Declined to levels comparable with earlier 20th century and even 19th century
- **Early 2000s:** Rising again
- The higher levels of 20th century inflation and the freeing of the gold price since 1971 have caused much greater *variation* in purchasing power than before — but the fluctuations remained around a **generally flat trend**

### England/UK: The Ultra-Long View (1560-2007)

- Chart XVII shows purchasing power of gold in England/UK from 1560 — nearly **450 years of data**
- The only time purchasing power of gold approached the 1970s/early 1980s spike was in the middle of the 16th century — the era of the "great Tudor inflation" and substantial arrivals of gold/silver from the Americas via Spain
- The period as a whole shows both series (wholesale and consumer-based) fluctuating around a **broadly flat trend** — regression analysis confirms the slope is not significantly different from zero
- Jastram identified six different periods (1560-1700, 1701-1792, 1793-1821, 1822-1914, 1915-1930, 1931-1976). Leyland notes a strong argument for 1971 onward as a separate period

### Periodization Detail

- 1561: Restoration of sound currency after Henry VIII's debasement (1509-1547) — inevitable fall in gold's purchasing power as debased issue replaced
- 1652: Lowest level in 17th century — associated with political turmoil (Civil War, Commonwealth, Restoration 1660)
- From 1652 until French Revolutionary/Napoleonic wars at end of 18th century: broadly stable, although slight downward trend due to growth of money supply after Bank of England founding (1694) and gold becoming smaller share of effective money
- After Napoleonic turbulence: upward movement in purchasing power through 19th century
- Before 1971: sharp fluctuations in 20th century due to wars and the fact that gold price was only adjusted once (1930s)
- After 1971: consumer-based purchasing power series trends generally upward with each trough and peak higher than the preceding one; wholesale-based series shows same tendency but not as clearly

### Other Countries

- Leyland examines gold's purchasing power in **France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland** — four countries with different economic experiences over the past 150 years
- Data available from roughly 1850, with some gaps (especially for Germany during hyperinflation and WWII)

- The work of economic historians has improved compilations of historical data, enabling analysis of additional countries — though data length is generally shorter than for UK/US
- Four countries examined: France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland — chosen because three of them allow examination of gold under more extreme economic/political circumstances than UK or US experienced
- Neither UK nor US suffered complete defeat leading to occupation by foreign forces; neither suffered resulting economic and financial breakdown
- France was invaded and occupied by Germany 1940-1944
- Germany and Japan suffered complete defeat, occupation, political and economic collapse, absorption of displaced persons, before rebirth as successful states
- Germany also experienced extreme hyperinflation (1920-1923): prices estimated at over one billion times 1923 levels during 1922
- Switzerland is the opposite extreme: island of neutrality and stability, currency widely considered "safe haven"
- Charts XVIII-XXI trace purchasing power of gold in these four countries using same methodology as for UK/US, on same scale as Charts XVI-XVII for inter-country comparison
- Given shorter time span, consumer price indices used (more readily available and more meaningful for recent history)

#### France
- Data from approximately 1840 to 2007 (Chart XVIII)
- Experienced several episodes of extreme inflation: Revolutionary/Napoleonic wars, Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), both World Wars
- Long periods on gold standard but also periods of monetary instability
- France was invaded and occupied during WWII — gap in series during that period since no meaningful exchange rate existed to calculate gold price
- Overall pattern: purchasing power fluctuated substantially but around a broadly flat trend, consistent with UK/US findings

#### Germany
- Data from approximately 1872 to 2007 (Chart XIX), with break during 1922-1923 hyperinflation and gap during/after WWII
- The 1922-1923 break reflects both statistical uncertainty (exchange rates varied widely) and the currency replacement: the *mark* was replaced by the *rentenmark* at end of 1923, ending the hyperinflationary episode; the *rentenmark* was later replaced by the *reichsmark*
- Western Germany data used from 1945 to 1989
- Most volatile of the four series, reflecting extreme economic/political upheavals
- Despite all turbulence, purchasing power still fluctuated around a flat trend

#### Japan
- Data from approximately 1900 to 2007 (Chart XX)
- Series interrupted during and after WWII
- Most volatile peaks — the 1980 peak comparable in magnitude to the US peak
- Pattern consistent with other countries despite Japan's unique economic trajectory (defeat, occupation, miraculous recovery, then stagnation from 1990s)

#### Switzerland
- Data from approximately 1890 to 2007 (Chart XXI)
- Smallest fluctuations of the four countries — not surprising given Switzerland's history of neutrality and stability
- Even here, the same basic pattern holds: fluctuations around a broadly flat trend

#### Cross-Country Conclusions
- Gold's purchasing power fluctuated, often substantially, in all four cases
- Extent of fluctuation varied from country to country
- Switzerland showed smallest fluctuations; Japan the most volatile
- **In each case the fluctuations appear to be around a flat, or broadly flat trend**
- Despite all upheavals, purchasing power of gold was maintained over long periods of time
- This finding is consistent with exchange rate theory: in normal circumstances exchange rates tend to compensate for differences in inflation between countries, so if gold's purchasing power reverts to a constant trend in one country, same is likely true for others
- Even through the turbulent circumstances of the twentieth century, this has held true

### Conclusions and Reflections

Jastram arrived at four conclusions:

1. Gold is a poor hedge against major inflation
2. Gold appreciates in operational wealth in major deflations
3. Gold is an abysmal/ineffective hedge against yearly commodity price increases
4. Nevertheless gold maintains its purchasing power over long periods of time — not because gold eventually moves towards commodity prices but because **commodity prices return to gold**

Leyland notes that from the perspective of the early 21st century, many of the inflationary (and deflationary) episodes Jastram examined were far from "major" in Britain and the United States. The analysis must be adapted for the post-1971 era.

#### Adapted Conclusions (Leyland)

- **Inflation hedge:** When the gold price was fixed, it was indeed a poor hedge against inflation. But when freed, gold became not just a hedge but *more than that* — in the 1970s its price rose eight times more rapidly than prices generally in the US, nearly five times as rapidly in the UK, and between four and six times as rapidly in the other four countries shown. Confidence in gold as a safe haven prompted many to turn to it in times of anxiety over price rises

- **Deflation hedge:** Cannot be fully tested since no major deflation has occurred since 1971 when gold was freed. However, in a period of disinflation (positive but declining inflation) from 1999, gold prices in Japan fell slightly — suggesting the purchasing power of gold fell in disinflation. But this is not conclusive

- **Year-to-year hedging:** Gold has *some* hedging properties against yearly price increases or changes in inflation fears — but it is not a particularly efficient hedge

- **Long-term purchasing power constancy:** Gold nevertheless maintains its purchasing power over long periods. However, once the gold price was freed, we cannot simply argue that commodity prices "return to gold." Jastram's history of the 19th century and earlier shows alternation of increases and decreases in commodity price levels relative to a fixed market price of gold. In the 19th century, it was *other prices* which ultimately adapted to gold so that gold's purchasing power did not differ from a constant. In the late 20th century, it was the *market price of gold* which adjusted so that purchasing power returned to a constant

- **Jastram's main finding — of constancy in the purchasing power of gold — still holds** despite tremendous changes in prices, the gold market, and economic/political circumstances since the start of the 20th century, and despite the freeing of the gold price since 1971

#### The Attila Effect Revisited

- The extension to additional countries further illustrates what Jastram called the "Attila effect"
- Throughout history, men and women have turned to gold in times of distress — whether political, economic, or personal
- Possession of gold has at times made the difference between life and death
- The experience of France, Germany, and Japan in the 20th century powerfully illustrates this: through military defeat, occupation, economic/political breakdown, hyperinflation (Germany), and the second worst example of hyperinflation ever recorded (Hungary after WWII) — while currencies disappeared or saw their purchasing power tumble, the real value of gold endured and emerged from all these crises almost unchanged

> "It does not, though, require such extreme episodes to demonstrate the value of gold in a crisis."

- The 1970s experience — when governments and monetary authorities had lost control of inflation — shows gold's value in lesser but still significant crises
- The late 1990s — when economic confidence was high, inflation low, monetary authorities seemed in control — the purchasing power of gold and its price were low
- The 2007 financial crisis (as the book went to press) was testing these patterns again, with gold responding by rising in all major currencies

#### Why Does Gold Maintain Its Purchasing Power?

- Full explanation has "so far proved elusive"
- Several partial thoughts can be advanced:

**Dismissing a false argument:** Some argue that gold's fixed price automatically maintained purchasing power in stable-price eras. But economic history has shown that no fixed price can survive forever if divorced from market fundamentals

**The J.S. Mill mechanism (1848):** If prices were falling (gold's relative value rising), there was incentive to mine more gold → more gold produced → general price level would rise → gold's purchasing power would fall. If prices were rising, cost of mining gold increased → incentive to produce gold declined → limiting supply. This basic mechanism linked gold to prices through supply responses

**Money supply link:** More broadly, inflation is linked to money supply growth relative to goods/services. In the past, when money was primarily gold/silver or backed by it, the supply of monetary metals largely controlled inflation. Since metal supplies changed only very slowly, inflation was controlled and any price rise was likely to be followed by corrective decline. Even when paper money was issued backed by gold/silver, effective money supply far exceeded actual metal, but there remained *some* links to gold supply, creating an automatic tendency for purchasing power constancy

**The gold standard as commitment mechanism:** During the actual gold standard, fixing the gold price acted as a "commitment mechanism" — governments acted to maintain stable prices. It was understood governments would suspend gold convertibility only during major emergencies (wars) and return to it afterward. Michael Bordo of Rutgers University analyzed this in detail (1995), also examining with Anna Schwartz the historical relationship between gold and money supply

**Post-WWI complications:** The various monetary regimes of the inter-war period and post-WWII Bretton Woods system represented far weaker commitment mechanisms, with inflation becoming endemic even before Bretton Woods collapsed in 1971. Yet purchasing power of gold still fluctuated around a constant level across six countries with very different political and economic experiences

**Scarcity and physical properties:** Gold is a scarce metal — total quantity ever mined estimated at only 161,000 metric tonnes (as of end 2007). If formed into a cube, the side would be only 20.274 metres (66.515 feet). Supply available to the market changes only slowly. Main uses have always been jewelry, adornment, or investment — with industrial use only a small part. Both jewelry and gold in bars/coins can readily be sold back when circumstances dictate. Scrap (recycled) gold from jewelry alone has equaled ~1/3 of supply from newly mined gold. A rise in gold price tends to increase scrap supply. Gold price is far less volatile than most other commodity prices because newly mined gold in any year is only a small fraction of the existing stock

**No one's liability:** Gold, unlike all paper-based assets, is no one's liability. It cannot be eroded by decline in the creditworthiness of its issuer. This gives it a near-unique "safe-haven" quality, ensuring a continuing and recurring role even alongside sophisticated modern financial instruments

**The five gold coins:** The great gold coins of the past — the Roman *aureus*, the Roman *solidus* (which became the Byzantine *nomisma* or *bezant*), the Islamic *dinar*, the Venetian *ducat*, and the British sovereign — endured not just in their own lands but internationally for centuries. These five coins span two millennia from the first century BC to almost the present day

**Constant price globally:** The price of gold has always tended to be constant throughout the world. High value-to-weight ratio means shipping costs are comparatively small. Any temporary shortage can be solved quickly — gold can be shipped overnight from Dubai to India. Major price discrepancies between countries have occurred only when governments erected artificial barriers

**Cyclical nature of economics:** Economic activity goes in cycles. The 2007/2008 financial crisis echoed parallels with the 1970s commodity boom. Following two decades of disinflation, inflation was re-emerging; the financial crisis was testing monetary authorities. Gold is no one's liability and is thus considered a safe haven. When confidence is high and authorities seem in control, gold demand and price falls. When confidence falters, demand rises and price rises. This alternation could help explain longer-term constancy

**Post-1971 test:** From 1971, the ability of gold to maintain long-term purchasing power constancy is being tested as never before — gold is no longer a formal part of the global monetary system for the first time in centuries. Thirty-six years is too short to be conclusive, but twice — in the 1970s and current decade — the price and purchasing power of gold has risen sharply, suggesting its desirability does not fade

> "In choosing the title *The Golden Constant* Roy Jastram did not mean to imply that there was some mathematical absolute to which the purchasing power of gold adhered, but rather that gold exhibited the qualities of constancy in a wider sense."

- Gold is almost immune to corrosion, rust, or decay — one element of its constancy
- The enduring reasons for people to buy gold — the imperative to survive and be secure, and the desire to possess and enjoy beauty — are human needs that do not change
- The enduring attraction that the metal holds for humankind is another element
- The fact that purchasing power, while fluctuating, returns over centuries and in different countries to a broadly stable level is testament to all these elements of its constancy
