<!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS -->
<h2 id="takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<div class="summary-section">
<ol>
<li><strong>The Golden Constant itself:</strong> Gold's purchasing power, while fluctuating significantly in the short and medium term, returns to a broadly stable level over long periods &mdash; across centuries, across countries, through wars, hyperinflation, deflation, and regime changes. This is the book's central, empirically-demonstrated thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Gold is a poor short-term inflation hedge (when price is fixed):</strong> During centuries when gold's price was set by law, gold lost purchasing power during inflationary periods because its price couldn't rise with other prices. Documented across 12+ English and 10+ American inflationary episodes.</li>
<li><strong>Gold appreciates in major deflations:</strong> When general prices fell, gold's fixed price meant its purchasing power rose &mdash; sometimes dramatically. Counterintuitive for modern investors who think of gold primarily as an inflation hedge.</li>
<li><strong>Post-1971: Gold became a genuine inflation hedge once freed:</strong> The dynamic reversed. In the 1970s, gold's price rose 8x faster than general prices in the US and ~5x faster in the UK. The "poor inflation hedge" finding applied only when the price was artificially fixed.</li>
<li><strong>The Retrieval Phenomenon:</strong> After every sustained inflationary or deflationary episode, gold's purchasing power eventually retrieved &mdash; returning toward its long-term constant. This happened repeatedly across 400+ years of English data and 175+ years of American data.</li>
<li><strong>The Attila Effect:</strong> Throughout history, people turn to gold in times of extreme distress &mdash; political, economic, personal. Possession of gold has literally meant the difference between life and death during wars, occupations, and currency collapses.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity prices adjust to gold, not vice versa (pre-1971):</strong> Under fixed gold prices, it was general commodity prices that eventually returned to levels consistent with gold's price. Post-1971, the mechanism reversed: the market price of gold adjusts to restore purchasing power constancy.</li>
<li><strong>Gold is useless as a year-to-year hedge:</strong> Gold is an "abysmal" hedge against normal annual commodity price fluctuations. Not a particularly efficient hedge on short timescales.</li>
<li><strong>The gold price was fixed for most of the 400+ years studied:</strong> From 1560&ndash;1976, the gold price was legally fixed for the vast majority of the period. The post-1971 free-market era is historically unprecedented.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-country universality:</strong> Analysis extended to France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland &mdash; countries with vastly different experiences. In all six countries, gold's purchasing power fluctuated around a broadly flat trend.</li>
<li><strong>Gold's scarcity is fundamental:</strong> Total gold ever mined (~161,000 tonnes by 2007) would fit in a cube just 20 metres per side. Annual mine production is a tiny fraction of existing stock.</li>
<li><strong>Supply dynamics shifted dramatically post-1971:</strong> South Africa: 70% (1970) to &lt;17% (2000). Central banks became net sellers. Gold ETFs (2003) transferred &gt;1,000 tonnes from central banks to private investors. Jewelry demand shifted to developing countries.</li>
<li><strong>The gold standard as "commitment mechanism":</strong> Fixing the gold price forced governments to maintain price stability. Analyzed by Michael Bordo (1995).</li>
<li><strong>No complete theory exists:</strong> Why gold maintains purchasing power constancy remains without a comprehensive theoretical explanation.</li>
<li><strong>The five immortal gold coins:</strong> The Roman <em>aureus</em>, the <em>solidus/nomisma/bezant</em>, the Islamic <em>dinar</em>, the Venetian <em>ducat</em>, and the British sovereign &mdash; spanning two millennia from the 1st century BC.</li>
<li><strong>Gold's dual function is unchanging:</strong> The imperative to survive and be secure, and the desire to possess and enjoy beauty. These ensure perpetual demand regardless of era.</li>

<!-- THEMATIC BREAKDOWNS -->
<h2 id="themes">Thematic Breakdowns</h2>

<h3>I. The English Experience (1560&ndash;1976)</h3>
<ul>
<li>400+ years of data on gold prices, commodity prices, and purchasing power</li>
<li>Six distinct periods identified with different characteristics</li>
<li>Gold standard formally established with Newton's 1717 recoinage</li>
<li>Key episodes: Tudor inflation, Napoleonic Wars suspension, Victorian deflation, two World Wars, Bretton Woods era</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. The American Experience (1800&ndash;1976)</h3>
<ul>
<li>175 years of parallel data</li>
<li>Gold standard evolution: Hamilton's 1792 Coinage Act &rarr; Crime of 1873 &rarr; FDR's 1934 devaluation ($20.67 to $35/oz)</li>
<li>Civil War greenback suspension as natural experiment</li>
<li>Striking parallelism with English findings despite different institutional arrangements</li>
</ul>

<h3>III. After the Gold Price Was Freed (1971&ndash;2007)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three subperiods: High Inflation (1970&ndash;80), Disinflation (1980&ndash;2000), Inflation Fears Revived (2000&ndash;07)</li>
<li>Gold soared from $35 to $850 (Jan 1980), fell to $256 (2001), then rose past $1,000 (2008)</li>
<li>Purchasing power of gold rose ~8x in the 1970s (US), then gave most of it back by 2000</li>
<li>Extension to four additional countries confirms universality of findings</li>
</ul>

<h3>IV. Supply &amp; Demand Revolution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Production: South Africa's dominance ended; mining went global</li>
<li>Central banks: from net buyers to net sellers (Washington Agreement 1999)</li>
<li>Demand: jewelry shifted from Western to developing-country dominance</li>
<li>Financial innovation: gold ETFs (2003), gold leasing, forward selling by miners</li>
<li>Deregulation: US ownership legalized 1975, India/China markets liberalized</li>
</ul>

<!-- CONTRARIAN IDEAS -->
<h2 id="contrarian">Contrarian Ideas</h2>
<div class="contrarian">
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold is NOT an inflation hedge</strong> (when its price is fixed) &mdash; directly contradicts popular belief, but empirically demonstrated across centuries</li>
<li><strong>Gold performs BEST in deflation</strong> (when price is fixed) &mdash; the opposite of what most people assume</li>
<li><strong>Commodity prices move to gold, not gold to commodities</strong> &mdash; Jastram's most distinctive insight: under fixed gold prices, it was the general price level that eventually adjusted to be consistent with gold</li>
<li><strong>The "poor inflation hedge" finding reversed after 1971</strong> &mdash; once freed, gold became a powerful inflation hedge, but this is only ~36 years of data vs. 400+ years of the opposite</li>
<li><strong>Gold's purchasing power in the mid-20th century was nearly identical to the mid-17th century</strong> &mdash; a span of 300 years with two industrial revolutions, world wars, and the transition from agrarian to modern economies</li>
<li><strong>The gold standard was not rigidly maintained</strong> &mdash; regularly suspended during wars and crises, then restored. The expectation of restoration was itself a stabilizing force</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- AUTHOR'S KEY PROPOSALS -->
<h2 id="proposals">Author's Key Proposals</h2>
<div class="proposals">
<ul>
<li>Gold should be studied through <strong>quantitative evidence</strong>, not speculation or ideology &mdash; a deliberate act of "transposing speculative thought about gold into actual numbers"</li>
<li><strong>Operational wealth</strong> (purchasing power) is the correct measure for gold's value, not its nominal price</li>
<li>Gold's role as money should be understood through <strong>long historical arcs</strong> &mdash; trends visible over decades or centuries are invisible in year-to-year data</li>
<li>The <strong>Retrieval Phenomenon</strong> is the key empirical pattern: after every deviation, gold's purchasing power retrieves toward its long-run constant</li>
<li>Post-1971 gold markets require <strong>adaptation</strong> of Jastram's original conclusions, not their abandonment</li>
</ul>

<!-- PART I: THE ENGLISH EXPERIENCE -->
<h2 id="part1" class="chapter-header">Part I: The English Experience (1560&ndash;1976)</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1: The Price of Gold</h3>
<p>The fundamental unit of English currency was the <strong>penny</strong> (from the Latin <em>denarius</em>). The pound was originally a literal pound of silver. Gold entered English coinage gradually, eventually displacing silver as the dominant monetary metal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newton's 1717 recoinage:</strong> As Master of the Mint, Newton set the gold guinea at 21 shillings, inadvertently overvaluing gold relative to silver. Silver drained away (Gresham's Law), and England was effectively on a gold standard decades before it was formally adopted</li>
<li><strong>The gold standard formally established 1816</strong> (Lord Liverpool's Act), though de facto since 1717</li>
<li>Gold prices were remarkably stable for centuries: the Mint price barely changed from 1717 to 1914</li>
<li>Jastram constructed a unified <strong>Index of Gold Prices</strong> (1930=100) from multiple sources: Mint prices, Bank of England buying prices, and market prices during suspensions of convertibility</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Gold is the most consistent standard of comparison for measuring wealth across times and places."</blockquote>

<h3>Chapter 2: Historical Fluctuations in the Price of Gold</h3>
<p>A sweeping 633-year survey from <span class="key-number">1343</span> to <span class="key-number">1976</span>.</p>
<h4>1343&ndash;1700: The Long Climb to the Gold Standard</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gold price rose gradually as the currency was repeatedly debased &mdash; especially under Henry VIII (1509&ndash;1547)</li>
<li>Elizabeth I's 1560 restoration of sound currency was a crucial turning point</li>
<li>Price of gold was essentially constant from 1560 to 1700 (in terms of fine gold content)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1700&ndash;1800: The Gold Standard and Stability</h4>
<ul>
<li>Newton's 1717 fixing held for nearly a century</li>
<li>Remarkable price stability &mdash; the gold price barely moved</li>
</ul>

<h4>1800&ndash;1820: Napoleon and the Aftermath</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bank of England suspended gold convertibility in 1797 (Bank Restriction Act) due to war-related gold drain</li>
<li>Gold premium emerged in the market &mdash; paper pounds traded at a discount to gold</li>
<li>Resumption of convertibility in 1821 after the wars ended</li>
<li>The Bullion Committee (1810) debated whether the premium on gold reflected gold's scarcity or the overissue of paper</li>
</ul>

<h4>1914&ndash;1946: Two Wars and the Great Depression</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gold standard suspended at outbreak of WWI (1914)</li>
<li>Britain returned to gold in 1925 at pre-war parity (Churchill's decision, widely criticized &mdash; Keynes called it a return at the wrong rate)</li>
<li>Britain abandoned the gold standard again in 1931 during the Depression</li>
<li>US devalued gold from $20.67 to $35/oz in 1934 (Roosevelt's Gold Reserve Act)</li>
<li>Post-WWII: Bretton Woods system established $35/oz as the international anchor</li>
</ul>

<h4>1948&ndash;1976: A Period That Cannot Yet Be Labeled</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gold price fixed at $35/oz under Bretton Woods but pressures mounted</li>
<li>London Gold Pool (1961&ndash;68): central banks intervened to hold $35 parity</li>
<li>Two-tier system established March 1968; official price diverged from market</li>
<li>Nixon closed the gold window August 15, 1971</li>
<li>Gold price freed and soared: $35 &rarr; $183 by 1974</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 3: Commodity Prices and the Construction of Index Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jastram constructed a unified wholesale commodity price index for England (1560&ndash;1976) from multiple overlapping sources</li>
<li>Used <strong>wholesale prices</strong> rather than retail/consumer prices because (a) longer data availability, (b) more consistently measured, (c) less affected by local market conditions</li>
<li>Sources: Phelps-Brown/Hopkins (1560&ndash;1700), Gayer-Rostow-Schwartz (1790&ndash;1850), Jevons (1782&ndash;1850), Sauerbeck-Statist (1846&ndash;1976), Board of Trade (1871&ndash;1976)</li>
<li>Index numbers rebased to <strong>1930=100</strong> for consistency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 4: The Purchasing Power of Gold</h3>
<p><strong>Purchasing Power = Gold Price Index / Commodity Price Index</strong>. This is the book's central metric &mdash; "operational wealth" in gold terms.</p>

<h4>Six Periods Identified:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1560&ndash;1700:</strong> Purchasing power declined after Elizabeth I's currency restoration, then stabilized</li>
<li><strong>1701&ndash;1792:</strong> Relative stability under the gold standard</li>
<li><strong>1793&ndash;1821:</strong> Napoleonic Wars distortion &mdash; gold premium emerged as Bank of England suspended convertibility</li>
<li><strong>1822&ndash;1914:</strong> Classical gold standard era &mdash; purchasing power fluctuated around the constant</li>
<li><strong>1915&ndash;1930:</strong> WWI disruption and troubled return to gold</li>
<li><strong>1931&ndash;1976:</strong> Gold standard abandoned &rarr; Bretton Woods &rarr; collapse &rarr; free float</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 5: Gold in Inflation and Deflation</h3>
<p>Jastram identified <strong>12 English episodes</strong> of inflation and deflation (1623&ndash;1976) and examined gold's purchasing power in each.</p>

<h4>Key Findings (England):</h4>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Period</th><th>Type</th><th>Duration</th><th>Gold's Purchasing Power</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1623&ndash;1658</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>35 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1658&ndash;1669</td><td>Deflationary</td><td>11 years</td><td>Rose</td></tr>
<tr><td>1675&ndash;1695</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>20 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1702&ndash;1723</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>21 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1752&ndash;1776</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>24 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1792&ndash;1813</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>21 years</td><td>Mixed (gold premium)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1813&ndash;1851</td><td>Deflationary</td><td>38 years</td><td>Rose sharply</td></tr>
<tr><td>1873&ndash;1896</td><td>Deflationary</td><td>23 years</td><td>Rose</td></tr>
<tr><td>1897&ndash;1920</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>23 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1920&ndash;1933</td><td>Deflationary</td><td>13 years</td><td>Rose</td></tr>
<tr><td>1933&ndash;1976</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>43 years</td><td>Declined then rose (post-1971)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Pattern:</strong> In every inflationary period (with gold price fixed), purchasing power declined. In every deflationary period, purchasing power rose. This held with near-perfect consistency.</p>

<h4>The Retrieval Phenomenon</h4>
<p>After each episode, gold's purchasing power <strong>retrieved</strong> &mdash; returning toward its long-run average. The commodity price level adjusted to gold, not gold to commodities. This is the mechanism behind the "Golden Constant."</p>

<blockquote>"It is not the gold price which reverts towards the commodity price level, but the commodity price level which returns towards the gold price."</blockquote>

<hr>

<!-- PART II: THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE -->
<h2 id="part2" class="chapter-header">Part II: The American Experience (1800&ndash;1976)</h2>

<h3>Chapter 6: The Gold Standard in the US &amp; Historical Fluctuations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hamilton's Coinage Act (1792):</strong> Established bimetallic standard at 15:1 silver-to-gold ratio</li>
<li><strong>1834 Coinage Act:</strong> Changed ratio to ~16:1, effectively putting US on gold standard</li>
<li><strong>Crime of 1873:</strong> Demonetized silver, formally establishing gold monometallism</li>
<li><strong>Civil War (1861&ndash;65):</strong> Greenback suspension &mdash; paper currency not convertible to gold; gold premium emerged (peaked at 185% in July 1864)</li>
<li><strong>Resumption Act (1875):</strong> Returned to gold convertibility January 1, 1879</li>
<li><strong>1934 Gold Reserve Act:</strong> FDR devalued from $20.67 to $35/oz; private gold ownership prohibited</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 7: The Purchasing Power of Gold (US)</h3>
<p>American experience closely paralleled England's, with the same basic patterns:</p>

<h4>US Inflationary and Deflationary Episodes:</h4>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Period</th><th>Type</th><th>Duration</th><th>Gold's Purchasing Power</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>1808&ndash;1814</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>6 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>

<tr><td>1933&ndash;1951</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>18 years</td><td>Declined</td></tr>
<tr><td>1951&ndash;1976</td><td>Inflationary</td><td>25 years</td><td>Declined then rose (post-1971)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Same consistent pattern: <strong>gold fails in inflation, excels in deflation</strong> when the price is fixed. The Retrieval Phenomenon operated in the US just as in England.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8: Reflections on the Golden Constant</h3>

<h4>The Attila Effect</h4>
<p>In times of mortal crisis &mdash; invasion, war, famine &mdash; gold becomes the ultimate refuge. From the fall of Rome to WWII refugees, gold is the "possession of a man who has nothing else." It can be carried, hidden, divided, and universally exchanged.</p>

<h4>Gold as a Hedge Against Inflation</h4>
<p>The empirical evidence is clear: <strong>gold has been a poor operational hedge against inflation</strong> in both England and the United States during the periods studied (when the price was fixed). This contradicts the popular belief held by most gold advocates.</p>

<h4>The Retrieval Phenomenon</h4>
<p>The most remarkable finding: after every major price movement (up or down), gold's purchasing power <em>retrieved</em> toward its long-run average. In England, this happened repeatedly over 400 years. In the US, the same pattern held over 175 years.</p>

<h4>The Level of Prices in the Very Long Run</h4>
<ul>
<li>English wholesale prices in 1930 were at almost exactly the same level as in 1560 &mdash; <span class="key-number">370 years</span> of mean reversion</li>
<li>This doesn't mean prices were stable &mdash; they fluctuated enormously. But they always came back</li>
<li>This pattern broke in the mid-20th century: the post-WWII inflationary trend has not (yet) reversed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Demand, Supply, and the Future</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gold demand rests on two permanent human drives: security and beauty</li>
<li>Supply is constrained by geology and mining costs &mdash; annual production is small relative to existing stock</li>
<li>Jastram was cautious about predictions but suggested gold would continue to serve its ancient functions</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Golden Constant</h4>
<p>Jastram's concluding section of the original 1977 text. Gold maintains purchasing power constancy not because of any monetary theory or government policy, but because of fundamental characteristics: scarcity, durability, universal desirability, and the enduring human needs it serves.</p>

<!-- PART III: AFTER THE GOLD PRICE WAS FREED -->
<h2 id="part3" class="chapter-header">Part III: After the Gold Price Was Freed, 1971&ndash;2007</h2>

<h3>Chapter 9: The Gold Market and the Purchasing Power of Gold, 1971&ndash;2007</h3>
<p>Jill Leyland extends Jastram's analysis using the same methodology. Consumer price indices are added alongside wholesale prices (available for longer periods in the UK).</p>

<h4>The Lead-up to 1971</h4>
<ul>
<li>1951&ndash;1970: continuous inflation made the fixed $35/oz gold parity increasingly unrealistic</li>
<li>Rising mining costs made gold production uneconomical while jewelry demand at the fixed price was increasingly attractive</li>
<li>Bretton Woods fixed parities caused economic strains in the 1960s as currencies became convertible</li>
<li>US balance of payments deficit (exacerbated by Vietnam War) resulted in gold flowing to Europe and Japan; US reserves fell sharply</li>
<li>US citizens prohibited from owning gold outside the US (since 1934)</li>
<li>London Gold Pool (1961&ndash;68): central banks coordinated to maintain $35; aggregate holdings increased from 31,100 tonnes ($35B) in 1950 to 38,300 tonnes ($43B) in 1965</li>
<li>London Gold Pool became net seller in 1966; collapsed in March 1968</li>
<li>Two-tier market established: official $35 rate for central banks; free market for private parties</li>
<li>Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) created in 1969 as new reserve asset</li>
<li>August 15, 1971: Nixon closed the gold window &mdash; US Treasury would no longer sell gold to foreign central banks</li>
<li>Smithsonian Agreement (Dec 1971): gold revalued to $38; dollar devalued 12%</li>
<li>February 1973: gold parity raised to $42.22; Bundesbank stopped buying dollars; fixed exchange rates collapsed</li>
<li>Two-tier system formally closed November 13, 1973</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes in the Gold Market, 1971&ndash;2007</h4>
<p><strong>Supply side:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Production declined in the 1970s as miners shifted to lower-grade ores, then recovered with technological advances (heap leaching, roasting, autoclaving)</li>
<li>South Africa: 70% of production (1970) &rarr; 17% (2000). US, Australia, China rose; by 2007 China had just exceeded South Africa</li>
<li>Production peaked in 2001, then declined as low prices in the 1990s reduced exploration spending</li>
<li><strong>Forward selling:</strong> From mid-1980s, miners sold future production to bullion banks, effectively accelerating gold supply; this increased through the 1990s, then miners began unwinding positions from 2000</li>
<li><strong>Central bank sales:</strong> US auctioned 1.3m oz (40 tonnes) in 1975; IMF disposed of 1/3 of its gold; Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, Australia, Argentina, Switzerland, UK all sold. Washington Agreement (1999): European central banks agreed to limit sales to ~400 tonnes/year. Renewed in 2004 with 500 tonnes/year limit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Demand side:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deregulation opened gold to more investors: US ownership legalized (1975), India liberalized (1990s), China gradually opened</li>
<li><strong>Gold bullion coins:</strong> Krugerrand (1967), then American Eagle, Canadian Maple Leaf &mdash; marketed as investment coins at small premium over spot</li>
<li><strong>Gold ETFs (2003):</strong> Effectively shares backed by physical gold; provided easy access for institutional and retail investors; transferred &gt;1,000 tonnes from central bank reserves to private investors</li>
<li><strong>Jewelry demand:</strong> By 1970, fabrication (jewelry, coins, industrial) exceeded mine production. Jewelry: ~75% of identifiable demand (2000&ndash;07). Developing countries (India, China, Middle East) overtook Western markets in the 1980s and accounted for ~2/3 of jewelry buying by the early 1990s</li>
<li>Asian/Middle Eastern jewelry is typically higher carat (18&ndash;24 carat) sold by weight at low markup &mdash; functions as both adornment and savings. Scrap supply is very price-responsive</li>
</ul>

<h4>1970&ndash;1980: High Inflation, 10 Years</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gold price surged in the 1970s &mdash; initially a catch-up from the artificially low $35/oz level</li>
<li>External factors: South Africa and USSR stopped selling (1972); October 1973 Yom Kippur War + OPEC oil embargo; 1979 Iranian revolution + second oil shock; Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; Iranian hostage crisis</li>
<li>Gold peaked at <span class="key-number">$850/oz</span> on January 21, 1980</li>
<li>1980 annual average: $614.50 &mdash; seventeen times higher than the 1970 average of $35.95</li>
<li><strong>US:</strong> Wholesale prices rose 143%; purchasing power of gold rose <span class="key-number">602%</span></li>
<li><strong>UK:</strong> Wholesale prices rose 201%; purchasing power of gold rose <span class="key-number">483%</span></li>
<li><strong>Key difference from Jastram's findings:</strong> With gold price now free, it rose <em>much faster</em> than inflation &mdash; gold became more than a hedge; it became a multiplier. Jastram had noticed this tendency but was writing too early to confirm it</li>
<li>Historically the 1980 peak in purchasing power was easily a record &mdash; in the UK, over 50% higher than the highest peak in Jastram's analysis (1562), and over twice the 1935 peak</li>
</ul>

<h4>1980&ndash;2000: Disinflation, 20 Years</h4>
<ul>
<li>October 1979: Volcker's Federal Reserve adopted severely contractionary monetary policy</li>
<li>Thatcher government in UK raised interest rates and introduced deflationary budgets</li>
<li>Inflation declined sharply through the first half of the 1980s; conquered (mostly) by 1990s</li>
<li>Gold price fell from $850 peak &mdash; volatile in early 1980s, then relatively narrow range (late 1980s to 1996), trough of <span class="key-number">$256</span> on April 2, 2001</li>
<li>1980s problems: international debt crisis (Mexico 1982), strong dollar (Plaza Accord 1985 to depreciate it), Louvre Accord 1987, Black Monday (October 1987)</li>
<li>1989&ndash;91: Fall of Communism, collapse of USSR, European exchange rate crises</li>
<li>Late 1990s: "perfect storm" against gold &mdash; long-subdued inflation, booming stock markets, growing economy, high confidence in monetary authorities, central bank selling, increased mine production, increased forward sales</li>
<li><strong>US:</strong> Wholesale prices rose 48%; purchasing power of gold fell <span class="key-number">69%</span></li>
<li><strong>UK:</strong> Wholesale prices rose 121%; purchasing power of gold fell <span class="key-number">69%</span></li>
</ul>

<h4>2000&ndash;2007: Inflation Fears Revived</h4>
<ul>
<li>From the April 2001 trough of $256, gold entered a sustained upward trend</li>
<li>Passed the January 1980 peak in January 2008, touching $1,000/oz in March 2008</li>
<li>Commodity prices booming; oil prices rising; inflation re-emerging as a concern</li>
<li>2007 financial crisis beginning as the book went to press &mdash; gold responding by rising in all currencies</li>
<li>Three political periods also fit: 1970s (Vietnam, Iranian crisis), 1980s&ndash;90s (fall of Communism, US hegemony), 2000s (challenges to American power, terrorism)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ch10" class="chapter-header">Chapter 10: Further Explorations into the Gold Price and its Purchasing Power</h2>

<h3>Purchasing Power in Historical Context (1800&ndash;2007)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Charts XV&ndash;XVII show the full purchasing power series for the US and UK from 1800 (and from 1560 for UK)</li>
<li>From 1800&ndash;1930, wholesale and consumer price growth was almost identical in the US; the difference from 1930&ndash;1970 was not very great. But from 1970 onwards, the two series diverge substantially</li>
<li>In the UK the comparison for earlier periods is not quite as neat, but the difference in the last period (post-1970) is more substantial</li>
<li>Before 1971: sharp fluctuations due to wars and the fact that gold price was only adjusted once (in the 1930s)</li>
<li>After 1971: much greater <em>variation</em> in purchasing power, but fluctuations remained around a <strong>generally flat trend</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>England/UK: The Ultra-Long View (1560&ndash;2007)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chart XVII shows nearly <span class="key-number">450 years</span> of purchasing power data</li>
<li>The only time purchasing power approached the 1970s/1980s spike was in the mid-16th century &mdash; the "great Tudor inflation" and arrival of New World gold/silver via Spain</li>
<li>Regression analysis confirms the slope of the long-term trend is <strong>not significantly different from zero</strong></li>
<li>Jastram identified six sub-periods; Leyland argues 1971 onward should be a seventh, distinct period</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Countries</h3>
<p>Four countries with different economic experiences over the past 150 years:</p>

<h4>France (1840&ndash;2007)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experienced extreme episodes: Revolutionary/Napoleonic wars, Franco-Prussian War, both World Wars</li>
<li>Invaded and occupied during WWII (gap in data series)</li>
<li>Overall pattern: purchasing power fluctuated substantially but around a broadly flat trend</li>
</ul>

<h4>Germany (1872&ndash;2007)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Break during 1922&ndash;23 hyperinflation (prices over 1 billion times 1923 levels)</li>
<li>Currency replaced: <em>mark</em> &rarr; <em>rentenmark</em> &rarr; <em>reichsmark</em></li>
<li>Gap during/after WWII; Western Germany data used 1945&ndash;89</li>
<li>Most volatile of the four series, but still fluctuated around a flat trend</li>
</ul>

<h4>Japan (1900&ndash;2007)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Series interrupted during and after WWII</li>
<li>Most volatile peaks &mdash; the 1980 peak comparable to the US peak</li>
<li>Consistent pattern despite unique trajectory (defeat, occupation, miracle recovery, 1990s stagnation)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Switzerland (1890&ndash;2007)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smallest fluctuations &mdash; consistent with Switzerland's neutrality and stability</li>
<li>Same basic pattern: fluctuations around a broadly flat trend</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cross-country conclusion:</strong> In all four cases (and the original two), purchasing power fluctuated around a flat trend. Exchange rate theory supports this: if gold's purchasing power reverts to a constant in one country, exchange rate adjustments should produce similar results in others. Even through the turbulent 20th century, this held.</p>

<h3>Conclusions and Reflections</h3>

<h4>Jastram's Four Original Conclusions (Adapted by Leyland):</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inflation hedge:</strong> Poor when gold price was fixed; but once freed, gold became a powerful hedge &mdash; rising 8x faster than prices in the 1970s US. Confidence in gold as safe haven prompts flight to gold in times of anxiety</li>
<li><strong>Deflation hedge:</strong> Cannot be fully tested post-1971 since no major deflation has occurred. In mild disinflation (Japan late 1990s), gold's purchasing power fell &mdash; but inconclusive</li>
<li><strong>Year-to-year hedging:</strong> Gold has <em>some</em> hedging properties but is not a particularly efficient year-to-year hedge</li>
<li><strong>Long-term constancy:</strong> <strong>Confirmed.</strong> But the mechanism changed. Pre-1971: commodity prices adjusted to gold. Post-1971: gold's market price adjusts to restore purchasing power constancy</li>
</ol>

<h4>Why Does Gold Maintain Its Purchasing Power?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>J.S. Mill mechanism:</strong> Gold supply self-corrects through mining incentives tied to relative prices</li>
<li><strong>Money supply link:</strong> When money was backed by gold, inflation was constrained by the slow growth of monetary metals</li>
<li><strong>Commitment mechanism:</strong> The gold standard forced government discipline; even suspension was expected to be temporary</li>
<li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Only 161,000 tonnes ever mined; annual production is tiny fraction of stock; both jewelry and investment gold can return to market easily</li>
<li><strong>No one's liability:</strong> Unlike paper assets, gold cannot be devalued by its issuer's decline</li>
<li><strong>Cyclical economics:</strong> When confidence is high, gold demand/price falls; when confidence falters, demand/price rises. This alternation may help explain long-term constancy</li>
<li><strong>No complete theory</strong> yet explains the full picture</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"In choosing the title <em>The Golden Constant</em> Roy Jastram did not mean to imply that there was some mathematical absolute to which the purchasing power of gold adhered, but rather that gold exhibited the qualities of constancy in a wider sense. The fact that gold is almost immune to corrosion, rust or decay is one element of this. The enduring reasons for people to buy gold &mdash; the imperative to survive and be secure; and the desire to possess and enjoy beauty &mdash; are human needs that do not change."</blockquote>
