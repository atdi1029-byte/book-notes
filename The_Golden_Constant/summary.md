## Key Takeaways

1. **The Golden Constant itself:** Gold's purchasing power, while fluctuating significantly in the short and medium term, returns to a broadly stable level over long periods — across centuries, across countries, through wars, hyperinflation, deflation, and regime changes. This is the book's central, empirically-demonstrated thesis.

2. **Gold is a poor short-term inflation hedge (when price is fixed):** During the centuries when gold's price was set by law or monetary convention, gold lost purchasing power during inflationary periods because its price couldn't rise with other prices. Jastram documented this across 12+ English and 10+ American inflationary episodes.

3. **Gold appreciates in major deflations:** When general prices fell, gold's fixed price meant its purchasing power rose — sometimes dramatically. This is counterintuitive for modern investors who think of gold primarily as an inflation hedge.

4. **Post-1971: Gold became a genuine inflation hedge once freed:** When the gold price was no longer fixed, the dynamic reversed. In the 1970s, gold's price rose 8x faster than general prices in the US and ~5x faster in the UK. The "poor inflation hedge" finding applied only when the price was artificially fixed.

5. **The Retrieval Phenomenon:** After every sustained inflationary or deflationary episode, gold's purchasing power eventually retrieved — returning toward its long-term constant. This happened repeatedly across 400+ years of English data and 175+ years of American data.

6. **The Attila Effect:** Throughout history, people turn to gold in times of extreme distress — political, economic, personal. Possession of gold has literally meant the difference between life and death during wars, occupations, and currency collapses. France, Germany, and Japan in the 20th century powerfully illustrate this.

7. **Commodity prices adjust to gold, not vice versa (pre-1971):** Under fixed gold prices, it was general commodity prices that eventually returned to levels consistent with gold's price — not gold that chased commodity prices. Post-1971, the mechanism reversed: the market price of gold adjusts to restore purchasing power constancy.

8. **Gold is useless as a year-to-year hedge:** Gold is an "abysmal" hedge against normal annual commodity price fluctuations. It has some hedging properties against year-to-year inflation changes but is not an efficient hedge on this timescale.

9. **The gold price was fixed for most of the 400+ years studied:** This is the key context for all findings. From 1560-1976, the gold price was legally fixed for the vast majority of the period (with exceptions during wars like the Napoleonic era and Civil War). The post-1971 free-market era is historically unprecedented.

10. **Cross-country universality:** Leyland extended the analysis to France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland — countries with vastly different economic experiences (from Swiss stability to German hyperinflation). In all six countries studied, gold's purchasing power fluctuated around a broadly flat trend.

11. **Gold's scarcity is fundamental:** Total gold ever mined (~161,000 tonnes by 2007) would fit in a cube just 20 metres per side. Annual mine production is a tiny fraction of existing stock. This, combined with gold's indestructibility and the fact that it is no one's liability, helps explain its enduring value.

12. **Gold supply dynamics shifted dramatically post-1971:** South Africa went from 70% of production (1970) to under 17% (2000). The London Gold Pool collapsed in 1968. Central banks went from net buyers to net sellers. Gold ETFs (from 2003) transferred >1,000 tonnes from central banks to private investors. Jewelry demand shifted to developing countries (India, China, Middle East).

13. **The gold standard operated as a "commitment mechanism":** Fixing the gold price forced governments to maintain price stability. This mechanism — analyzed by Michael Bordo — explains much of why commodity prices stayed stable during gold standard eras, but doesn't fully explain why constancy persisted through the turbulent 20th century.

14. **No complete theory exists:** Why gold maintains purchasing power constancy across centuries, across countries, through fixed and free-price regimes, remains without a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Partial explanations include: the J.S. Mill supply mechanism, the scarcity/stock-to-flow argument, gold as no one's liability, the commitment mechanism of the gold standard, and cyclical economic patterns.

15. **The five immortal gold coins:** The Roman aureus, the solidus/nomisma/bezant, the Islamic dinar, the Venetian ducat, and the British sovereign — spanning two millennia from the 1st century BC to the modern era — were used not just domestically but internationally for centuries, testifying to gold's enduring monetary role.

16. **Gold's dual function is unchanging:** Gold serves two fundamental human needs that do not change: the imperative to survive and be secure, and the desire to possess and enjoy beauty. These ensure perpetual demand regardless of era or economic system.

## Thematic Breakdown

### I. The English Experience (1560-1976)
- 400+ years of data on gold prices, commodity prices, and purchasing power
- Six distinct periods identified with different characteristics
- The gold standard formally established with Newton's 1717 recoinage
- Key episodes: Tudor inflation, Napoleonic Wars suspension, Victorian deflation, two World Wars, Bretton Woods era

### II. The American Experience (1800-1976)
- 175 years of parallel data
- Gold standard evolution: Hamilton's 1792 Coinage Act → Crime of 1873 → FDR's 1934 devaluation ($20.67 to $35/oz)
- Civil War greenback suspension as natural experiment
- Striking parallelism with English findings despite different institutional arrangements

### III. After the Gold Price Was Freed (1971-2007)
- Three subperiods: High Inflation (1970-80), Disinflation (1980-2000), Inflation Fears Revived (2000-07)
- Gold soared from $35 to $850 (Jan 1980), fell to $256 (2001), then rose past $1,000 (2008)
- Purchasing power of gold rose ~8x in the 1970s (US), then gave most of it back by 2000
- Extension to four additional countries confirms universality of findings

### IV. Supply & Demand Revolution
- Production: South Africa's dominance ended; mining went global
- Central banks: from net buyers to net sellers (Washington Agreement 1999)
- Demand: jewelry shifted from Western to developing-country dominance
- Financial innovation: gold ETFs (2003), gold leasing, forward selling by miners
- Deregulation: US ownership legalized 1975, India/China markets liberalized

## Contrarian Ideas

- **Gold is NOT an inflation hedge** (when its price is fixed) — directly contradicts popular belief, but empirically demonstrated across centuries
- **Gold performs BEST in deflation** (when price is fixed) — the opposite of what most people assume
- **Commodity prices move to gold, not gold to commodities** — Jastram's most distinctive insight: under fixed gold prices, it was the general price level that eventually adjusted to be consistent with gold, not the other way around
- **The "poor inflation hedge" finding reversed after 1971** — once freed, gold became a powerful inflation hedge, but this is only ~36 years of data vs. 400+ years of the opposite
- **Gold's purchasing power in the mid-20th century was nearly identical to the mid-17th century** — a span of 300 years with two industrial revolutions, world wars, and the transition from agrarian to modern economies
- **The gold standard was not rigidly maintained** — it was regularly suspended during wars and crises, then restored. The expectation of restoration was itself a stabilizing force ("commitment mechanism")

## Notable Quotes

> "This book, more than any other I have ever read, has given me my lifelong passion for understanding the role of gold in our societies." — Pierre Lassonde

> "Gold is the possession of a man who has nothing else." — paraphrasing the Attila Effect

> "In choosing the title *The Golden Constant* Roy Jastram did not mean to imply that there was some mathematical absolute to which the purchasing power of gold adhered, but rather that gold exhibited the qualities of constancy in a wider sense." — Jill Leyland

## Author's Key Proposals

- Gold should be studied through **quantitative evidence**, not speculation or ideology — the book is a deliberate act of "transposing speculative thought about gold into actual numbers"
- **Operational wealth** (purchasing power) is the correct measure for gold's value, not its nominal price
- Gold's role as money should be understood through **long historical arcs** — trends visible over decades or centuries are invisible in year-to-year data
- The **Retrieval Phenomenon** is the key empirical pattern: after every deviation, gold's purchasing power retrieves toward its long-run constant
- Post-1971 gold markets require **adaptation** of Jastram's original conclusions, not their abandonment
