## Introduction

### Core Premise: A Template for Understanding Debt Crises

- **Ray Dalio** writes on the 10th anniversary of the 2008 financial crisis to share his template for understanding how all debt crises work
- Goal: reduce likelihood of future debt crises and improve crisis management
- Perspective differs from economists/policymakers: as an investor betting on market movements, Dalio focuses on **relative values and capital flows** that drive cycles

### Dalio's Historical Learning Method

- After being "repeatedly bit by events I never encountered before," Dalio studied all major economic/market movements in history chronologically
- Method: experience them as **virtual experiences**—day by day, month by month—placing market bets as if knowing only what happened until that moment
- Provides broader perspective than personal experience alone
- Personal crises experienced: Bretton Woods breakdown (1966–1971), 1970s inflation bubble and 1978–82 bursting, Latin American inflationary depression (1980s), Japanese bubble (late 1980s) and 1988–1991 bursting, tech bubble (2000), Great Deleveraging (2008)
- Historical crises studied: Roman Empire collapse (5th century), US debt restructuring (1789), Germany's Weimar Republic (1920s), Great Depression and WWII (1930–45), many others

### The Power of Pattern Recognition

- By examining many cases of each economic phenomenon and averaging them, Dalio visualized cause-effect relationships
- Created **archetypal models** (templates): archetypal business cycle, archetypal big debt cycle, archetypal deflationary deleveraging, archetypal inflationary deleveraging
- Pattern recognition: "Rather than seeing lots of individual things happening, I saw fewer things happening over and over again, like an experienced doctor who sees each case of a certain type of disease unfolding as 'another one of those'"

### Development with Bridgewater Associates

- Template developed with partners at **Bridgewater Associates** to prepare for unprecedented storms
- Built computer decision-making systems detailing reactions to virtually every possible occurrence
- Example: Eight years before 2008, built a **"depression gauge"** programmed for 1929–32 scenarios, allowing Bridgewater to perform well when others failed

### Book Structure

Three perspectives on debt crises:
1. **Part 1**: Template for the "Archetypal Big Debt Cycle" (most synthesized)
2. **Part 2**: Three Iconic Case Studies examined in detail (most granular)—US 2007–2011 (Great Recession), US 1928–1937 (deflationary depression), Germany 1918–1924 (inflationary depression)
3. **Part 3**: Compendium of 48 Case Studies covering last 100 years (chart form)

> "I guarantee that if you take the trouble to understand each of these three perspectives, you will see big debt crises very differently than you did before."

- Comparing all three shows cases transpiring essentially the same way while revealing differences that prompt deeper understanding
- Includes glossary of economic terms and reference to 30-minute video "How the Economic Machine Works" at www.economicprinciples.org

## Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

### How I Think about Credit and Debt

**Fundamental definitions:**
- **Credit**: the giving of buying power, granted in exchange for a promise to pay it back (debt)
- **Debt**: the promise to repay borrowed buying power

> "Clearly, giving the ability to make purchases by providing credit is, in and of itself, a good thing, and not providing the power to buy and do good things can be a bad thing."

- Problem with debt: inability to pay it back
- **Central question**: whether rapid credit/debt growth is good or bad hinges on what credit produces and how debt is serviced

### Personal Perspective on Debt

- Dalio's personal preference: saving over borrowing (influenced by father)
- Learning: **too little credit/debt growth can create equally bad economic problems as having too much**—costs come as foregone opportunities
- For society, policymakers have controls individuals don't

### The Productivity Test

> "Whether or not more credit is desirable depends on whether the borrowed money is used productively enough to generate sufficient income to service the debt."

- If productive use occurs: resources well allocated, both lender and borrower benefit economically
- Must consider secondary/indirect economics alongside primary/direct economics
- Example: Education, infrastructure replacement may be cost-effective despite fiscal conservatism opposing borrowing

### Cost-Benefit Analysis of Bad Debt

**Subway system example:**
- $1 billion project financed with debt
- Revenues only 50% of expected, debt written down 50%
- Question: Is subway worth $500 million more than budgeted? (~2% per year over 25-year lifespan)
- May still be better than not having the subway

**Real-world bad debt scenario:**
- Really bad debt losses: ~40% of loan value can't be paid back
- Bad loans ~20% of all outstanding loans
- Losses = ~8% of total debt
- Total debt ~200% of income (GDP)
- Shortfall ~16% of GDP
- If "socialized" and spread over 15 years: ~1% per year (tolerable)

> "The downside risks of having a significant amount of debt depends a lot on the willingness and the ability of policy makers to spread out the losses arising from bad debts."

**Two critical factors for policy maker success:**
1. Whether debt is **denominated in the currency they control**
2. Whether they have **influence over creditor/debtor behavior**

### Are Debt Crises Inevitable?

- Throughout history, only a few well-disciplined countries have avoided debt crises
- Lending never done perfectly, often done badly due to **cycle effects on psychology** producing bubbles and busts
- Policy makers typically err on side of being too loose with credit because:
  - Near-term rewards (faster growth) seem to justify it
  - Politically easier to allow easy credit (guarantees, easing monetary policies) than tight credit
- This is the main reason for big debt cycles

### Why Do Debt Crises Come in Cycles?

> "I am talking about nothing more than logically-driven series of events that recur in patterns."

- In market-based economies, credit expansions/contractions drive economic cycles for logical reasons
- Patterns similar but sequences neither pre-destined nor identical in timing

**The fundamental cycle mechanism:**
- Borrowing = spending more than you make
- You're borrowing from your **future self**
- Creates future period requiring spending less than you make to pay back
- This pattern (borrow → spend more → spend less) resembles a cycle
- True for individuals and national economies
- Borrowing sets a **mechanical, predictable series of events** into motion

### The Monopoly Analogy

**Standard Monopoly:**
- Early game: lots of cash, few properties → convert cash to property
- As properties accumulate, more cash needed for rents
- Some forced to sell property at discounted prices
- Early: "property is king," later: "cash is king"
- Best players balance property and cash mix

**Monopoly with Banking:**
- Adding loans/deposits: players borrow to buy property
- Deposit idle cash to earn interest (giving bank more to lend)
- Players buy/sell properties on credit
- Debt-financed hotel spending grows to multiples of money in existence
- Eventually debtors short on cash for rents and debt service
- Bank faces trouble as depositors withdraw while debtors fall behind
- Without intervention: banks and debtors go broke, economy contracts
- Over time, repeated expansion/contraction cycles create conditions for **big, long-term debt crisis**

### The Self-Reinforcing Nature of Credit Cycles

**Upward phase:**
- Lending supports spending/investment → supports incomes/asset prices
- Increased incomes/asset prices support further borrowing/spending
- Borrowing lifts spending/incomes **above consistent productivity growth**
- Peak lending based on expectation that above-trend growth continues indefinitely
- Eventually income falls below loan costs

**Characteristics of vulnerable economies:**
- Growth significantly supported by **debt-financed fixed investments, real estate, infrastructure**
- Fast building rates not sustainable
- Example: $10M/year office building → $0/year when finished
- Demand for workers/materials collapses
- Growth/income/debt-servicing ability depends on other demand
- Very typical of **emerging economies** (so much building to do)

### Emerging Market Cyclicality

- Changes in **competitiveness** due to relative income changes amplify cycles
- Typically: cheap labor, bad infrastructure → build infrastructure → export boom → rising incomes
- Growth rate from exports slows as income rises, wage competitiveness declines
- Example: Japan's 70-year experience

### Bubble Dynamics

- **Bubbles**: unrealistic expectations and reckless lending create critical mass of bad loans
- Eventually apparent to bankers and central bankers → bubble deflates
- Classic warning sign: **money borrowed to make debt service payments** (compounds indebtedness)

### The Reversal at the Top

- When money/credit growth curtailed and/or higher lending standards imposed: credit growth and spending slow
- More debt service problems emerge
- **Top of upward phase** at hand
- Central banks tighten monetary policy to contain dangerously fast credit growth
- Often accelerates decline (though would have happened anyway, just later)
- When debt service costs > amount that can be borrowed to finance spending: **upward cycle reverses**
- New lending slows, pressure on debtors to pay increases
- Clearer debtors are struggling → less new lending
- Spending/investment slowdown slows income growth further, asset prices decline

### Lender Crisis and Systemic Risk

- When borrowers can't meet obligations to lending institutions → lending institutions can't meet obligations to their creditors
- Policy makers must handle lending institutions first
- Most extreme pressures on: **most highly leveraged lenders with most concentrated exposures to failed borrowers**
- These pose biggest **knock-on effect risks** for creditworthy buyers and broader economy
- Typically banks, but broader set now includes: insurance companies, non-bank trusts, broker-dealers, special purpose vehicles

### Two Main Long-Term Problems from Debt Cycles

1. **Losses from expected debt service payments not being made**
   - Can lead to smaller periodic payments and/or debt write-downs (accepting less than owed)
   - Annual shortfall if expecting 4% and getting 2% or 0%
   - If debt marked down: much bigger one-time loss (e.g., 50%)

2. **Reduction of lending and spending it was financing going forward**
   - Even after crisis resolved, entities that borrowed too much unlikely to generate same spending levels
   - Has implications that must be considered

### Can Most Debt Crises Be Managed Well?

- Some cycles moderate (bumps), some extreme (crashes)
- This study examines extreme cases: real GDP declines >3%
- Based on examinations, Dalio believes policy makers **can manage them well** in almost every case where debts denominated in country's own currency
- Policy maker flexibility allows spreading harmful consequences so **big debt problems aren't really big problems**
- Most terrible economic problems occurred **before** policy makers took steps to spread them out
- Even biggest debt crises (1930s Great Depression) resolved once right adjustments made

**Biggest risks are:**
- Failure of policy makers to do right things due to lack of knowledge/authority
- Political consequences of adjustments that hurt some to help others

### The Critical Importance of Currency Denomination

> "I want to reiterate that 1) when debts are denominated in foreign currencies rather than one's own currency, it is much harder for a country's policy makers to do the sorts of things that spread out the debt problems, and 2) the fact that debt crises can be well-managed does not mean that they are not extremely costly to some people."

### The Key to Successful Crisis Management

> "The key to handling debt crises well lies in policy makers' knowing how to use their levers well and having the authority that they need to do so, knowing at what rate per year the burdens will have to be spread out, and who will benefit and who will suffer and in what degree, so that the political and other consequences are acceptable."

**Four levers to reduce debt/debt service relative to income/cash flow:**

1. **Austerity** (spending less)
2. **Debt defaults/restructurings**
3. **Central bank "printing money"** and making purchases (or guarantees)
4. **Transfers** of money/credit from those with more to those with less

### The Beautiful Deleveraging

- Each lever has different impacts: some inflationary and stimulate growth (e.g., "printing money"), others deflationary and reduce debt burdens (e.g., austerity, defaults)
- **"Beautiful deleveraging"**: debt-to-income ratios decline with acceptable inflation and growth rates
- In this scenario: debt-to-income ratios decline while economic activity and financial asset prices improve
- Gradually brings **nominal income growth rate back above nominal interest rate**

### Political Difficulties

- Levers shift who benefits and who suffers, over what time period
- Policy makers in politically difficult position making these choices
- Rarely appreciated, even when handling crisis well

<!-- pp. 21-40 -->

## The Template for the Archetypal Long-Term/Big Debt Cycle

### Study Methodology

- Template based on **48 big debt cycles** across large countries where real GDP fell >3% (**depression** definition)
- Two categories: **deflationary** (21 cases) vs. **inflationary** (27 cases) — split based on foreign currency debt
- ~75% correlation between foreign debt levels and inflation levels
- Analysis covers: period leading to depression, depression itself, and deleveraging afterward
- Timeline: 5 years before depression bottom through 7 years after

### Core Debt Crisis Mechanism

- Debt crises occur when **debt and debt service costs rise faster than incomes needed to service them**
- Central banks can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering real/nominal interest rates
- Severe debt crises (depressions) occur when **interest rates hit 0%** — no more room to ease
- Short-term business cycles compound into long-term debt cycles because each cycle ends with higher debt-to-income ratios
- US chart since 1910 shows interest payments stay flat/decline while debt rises — central bank (Fed) lowers rates to sustain debt-financed expansion until **hitting 0% bound**, triggering deleveraging

### Long-Term vs. Short-Term Debt Cycles

- **Short-term cycles**: produce mini-booms/recessions, controlled by central bank rate adjustments
- **Long-term cycles**: produce big booms/busts, more extreme debt burdens, less effective monetary policy
- US experienced two long-term debt crises: 1920s boom → 1930s Great Depression, and early 2000s boom → 2008 financial crisis
- Human nature drives the pattern: people prefer borrowing/spending over repaying debt → debts rise faster than incomes over long periods

### The Self-Reinforcing Upswing

- Rising spending generates rising incomes and net worths → raises borrowing capacity → enables more buying/spending
- **New financial intermediaries and instruments** develop outside regulatory supervision, offering higher returns, more leverage, greater liquidity/credit risk
- Borrowers spend unsustainably, appearing prosperous; lenders become complacent
- Debts cannot rise faster than money/income to service them forever → headed toward debt problem

### The Self-Reinforcing Downturn

- When debt growth limits reached: asset prices fall, debtors struggle, investors pull back → **liquidity problems**
- One person's spending = another's income → incomes decline → creditworthiness falls further
- Stock market crashes, unemployment rises, social tensions increase
- Self-reinforcing contraction not easily corrected — **debt burdens too big, need reduction**
- Unlike recessions: interest rates already at/near zero, liquidity/money cannot be increased by ordinary measures

### Historical Context

- Long-term debt cycles existed since before Roman times
- **Old Testament**: Year of Jubilee — debt wiped out every 50 years
- Pattern recurs throughout history

### Money's Two Purposes and Two Groups

- Money serves as **medium of exchange** and **store of wealth**
- Two groups: **proletariat-workers** (earn by selling time) vs. **capitalist-investors** (earn by lending money)
- Workers seek money for necessities; investors have stored wealth tied to money's value
- Capitalist-investors lend via: (a) debt instruments (promise to repay more), or (b) equity/stocks/real estate ownership

### The Deleveraging Necessity

- One person's financial assets = another's financial liabilities
- When claims on financial assets too high relative to money available → **big deleveraging must occur**
- Free-market credit system ceases working well, works in reverse via deleveraging
- Government must intervene: central bank becomes **lender of last resort**, central government becomes **redistributor of spending and wealth**
- Needs **debt restructuring** — claims on future spending (debt) reduced relative to money
- Imbalance between debt claims and money supply resolved via **four levers** (previously described)
- Process painful for all players, sometimes causing battle between workers and investors
- Can impair or outlaw lending — why usury considered sin in Catholicism and Islam

## Two Types of Depressions

### Deflationary Depressions

- Policy makers lower interest rates initially, but **lever ineffective at ~0%**
- Debt restructuring and austerity dominate without adequate stimulation (money printing, currency depreciation)
- Debt burdens rise as percent of income because incomes fall faster than restructuring/paydowns reduce debt stock
- Borrowers rack up more debts to cover higher interest costs
- Occur in countries where unsustainable debt financed **domestically in local currency**
- Produces forced selling and defaults, but **no currency or balance of payments problem**

### Inflationary Depressions

- Occur in countries reliant on **foreign capital flows** with significant **foreign currency debt** that can't be monetized
- When foreign capital slows → credit creation turns to credit contraction
- **Capital withdrawal drives up lending/liquidity** while **currency decline produces inflation**
- Especially difficult to manage — policy makers' abilities to spread pain more limited

## The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle (Goldilocks Period)

- Debt not growing faster than incomes, though debt growth is strong
- Borrowed money finances activities producing fast income growth (e.g., expanding productive businesses)
- Debt burdens low, balance sheets healthy — plenty of room to lever up
- Debt growth, economic growth, inflation "neither too hot nor too cold"

### 2) The Bubble

#### Bubble Dynamics

- **Debts rise faster than incomes**, producing accelerating strong asset returns and growth
- Self-reinforcing: rising incomes/net-worths/asset values raise borrowing capacity
- Lenders assess: (1) projected income/cash flows, (2) net worth/collateral, (3) own lending capacity
- Unsustainable because debt growth rates exceed incomes needed to service them
- Borrowers **feel rich, spend more than earned, buy assets at high prices with leverage**
- Example: earning $50K with $50K net worth, borrow $10K/year → spend $60K/year for years despite only earning $50K

#### The Up-Wave Duration

- Promises to deliver money (debt) rise relative to money supply and debtors' money/credit
- Typically lasts **decades**, with variations from central bank tightenings/easings
- Multiple short-term debt cycles compound into one long-term debt cycle

#### Central Bank Role in Sustaining Bubbles

- Central banks **progressively lower interest rates** → raises asset prices and wealth via present value effect
- Lowers monthly payment cost of credit-bought items, keeps debt service burdens from rising
- Cannot continue forever — eventually debt service payments ≥ amount debtors can borrow
- Debt cannot rise any more relative to money/credit coming in → **process works in reverse, deleveraging begins**
- Borrowing = pulling spending forward → person spending $60K/earning $50K must cut spending to $40K for equal years

#### The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market

- Bubbles start as **over-extrapolations of justified bull markets**
- Lower interest rates make stocks/real estate more attractive → prices rise, conditions improve → economic growth, profits, better balance sheets
- Asset value increases raise net worths and spending/income levels
- Confidence increases → supports leveraging-up process
- New buyers enter market (don't want to miss out) → fuels bubble emergence
- Often **uneconomic lending** due to implicit/explicit government guarantees encouraging reckless lending

#### Shadow Banking and Financial Engineering

- New speculators/lenders enter, credit standards fall
- Banks lever up; **new unregulated lending institutions develop** ("shadow banking system")
- Less under government protection blanket
- New lending vehicles invented, **financial engineering** takes place
- Lenders/speculators make fast, easy money → reinforces bubble by increasing equity/collateral for new loans

#### The Self-Feeding Cycle

- Stock example: rising prices → more spending/investment → raises earnings → raises prices → lowers credit spreads → encourages lending (based on collateral/earnings value) → affects spending/investment
- Assets seem like fabulous treasure to own — anyone not owning them is missing out
- Large **asset-liability mismatches** build up: (a) borrowing short-term to lend long-term, (b) liquid liabilities for illiquid assets, (c) risky debt/assets with borrowed money, (d) currency mismatches
- **Debts rise fast, debt service costs rise even faster**

#### Market Consensus and Extrapolation

- When consensus exists, it gets **priced in**
- Believed to be good picture of future, though history shows otherwise
- Humans move in crowds, weigh recent experience more heavily than appropriate
- Consensus view reflected in price → **extrapolation tends to occur**

#### Bubble Indicators at Peak

- Debt-to-income ratios rise very rapidly
- Typical bubble: leveraging up at **20-25% of GDP over ~3 years**
- At bubble top: total debt-to-income ~**300% of GDP**
- Key conditions during bubble: (1) Debt growing faster than incomes 40% (range 14-79%), (2) Debt growing rapidly 32%, (3) Income growth high but slower than debt 13%, (4) Equity markets extend rally 48% (range 22-68%), (5) Yield curve flattens 1.4% (range 0.9-1.7%)

### The Role of Monetary Policy

- **Monetary policy helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it**
- Especially when inflation and growth both good, investment returns great
- Interpreted as productivity boom → reinforces investor optimism as they leverage to buy assets
- Central banks focus on inflation/growth, reluctant to adequately tighten money
- Examples: Japan late 1980s, much of world late 1920s and mid-2000s

#### Central Bank Blind Spot

- Central bankers target inflation or inflation+growth, **don't target bubble management**
- Debt growth enabled can finance bubble creation if inflation/real growth don't appear too strong
- Dalio's opinion: **very important for central banks to target debt growth** with eye toward sustainable levels
- Central bankers say too hard to spot bubbles, not their role — but they control money/credit
- When money/credit goes into unpayable debts → huge implications for growth and inflation down the road
- **Greatest depressions occur when bubbles burst** — imprudent for policy makers to ignore them

#### Inadequate Tightening

- Central banks do tighten somewhat when inflation/growth get hot
- Short rates rise on average, but typical policies **not adequate to manage bubbles**
- Bubbles occurring in some parts of economy, not others
- Central banks fall behind curve during such periods
- Borrowers not yet squeezed by higher debt-service costs
- Interest payments increasingly covered by borrowing more rather than income growth — **clear sign trend is unsustainable**

#### The Reversal

- When bubble pops: same linkages that inflated it make downturn self-reinforcing
- Falling asset prices decrease equity/collateral values → lenders pull back → forces speculators to sell → prices fall more
- Lenders/investors "run" (withdraw money) from risky intermediaries/investments → liquidity problems
- Affected markets big enough and leveraged enough that losses on accumulated debt **systemically threatening** (threaten to topple entire economy)

### 3) The Top

#### Triggers for the Top

- When things so good they can't get better — yet everyone believes they will get better — **tops of markets being made**
- Tops triggered by different events, most often when **central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise**
- Sometimes tightening brought by bubble itself (growth/inflation rising, capacity constraints pinching)
- Sometimes externally driven — for countries reliant on external creditors, pulling back of lending due to exogenous causes leads to liquidity tightening
- Tightening of monetary policy in debt's currency can cause foreign capital pullback
- Unrelated reasons: cyclical conditions in reserve currency country → tightening in that currency, or financial crisis → capital pullback
- Currency rise relative to debt's currency can cause severe squeeze
- Unanticipated shortfalls in cash flows for any number of reasons can trigger debt crises

#### The Wealth Effect and Credit Squeeze

- Debt-service squeeze hurts asset prices (e.g., stock prices) → negative **"wealth effect"** as lenders worry about getting cash back
- Borrowers squeezed as increasing share of new borrowing goes to debt service and/or isn't rolled over
- Spending slows down
- Result of buying investment assets at high prices with leverage, based on overly optimistic assumptions about future cash flow

#### Early Warning Signs

- Credit/debt problems emerge **~6 months ahead of peak** in economy, first in most vulnerable/frothy pockets
- Riskiest debtors miss payments, lenders worry, credit spreads tick up, risky lending slows
- Runs from risky assets to less risky assets pick up → **broadening of contraction**

#### Yield Curve Dynamics

- In early top stages: rise in short rates **narrows or eliminates spread with long rates** (extra interest rate for lending long vs. short)
- Lessens incentive to lend relative to holding cash
- **Yield curve flat or inverted** (long-term rates at lowest relative to short-term rates) → people incentivized to move to cash just before bubble pops
- Slows credit growth, causes previously described dynamic

#### The Sowing of Recession Seeds

- Early on: some parts of credit system suffer, others remain robust → not clear economy is weakening
- While central bank still raising rates and tightening credit, **seeds of recession being sown**
- Fastest rate of tightening typically **~5 months prior to stock market top**
- Economy operating at high rate, demand pressing against capacity to produce
- Unemployment normally at cyclical lows, inflation rates rising
- Short-term interest rate increase makes holding cash more attractive, raises interest rate for

<!-- pp. 41-60 -->

### The Bubble Peak and Post-Bubble Dynamics

- **Short rates peak just before stock market top** — monetary tightening discounts future cash flows, weakens asset prices, slows lending and demand
- **Leverage amplifies vulnerability** — more leverage + higher prices = less tightening needed to burst bubble, bigger bust follows
- **Sector-level analysis critical** — magnitude of downturn depends less on overall tightening than on each sector's sensitivity to it and how losses cascade
- **Wealth effects dominate monetary policy post-bubble** — people underestimate this impact, mistakenly seeing early declines as buying opportunities while failing to account for coming earnings collapse
- **Self-reinforcing cycle**: wealth falls → incomes fall later → creditworthiness declines → lending contracts → spending/investment drop → fundamentals deteriorate → selling accelerates

## 4) The "Depression"

### When Monetary Policy Stops Working

**Normal recessions**: central banks cut rates enough to 1) create positive wealth effect, 2) stimulate activity, 3) ease debt-service burdens

**Depressions**: interest rates can't be cut materially because:
- Already near 0%, or
- Currency outflows/weakness creates floor due to credit/currency risk

> "This is precisely the formula for a depression."

**Historical pattern**: both 1930-32 and 2008-09 depressions followed this dynamic

**2007-08 US response**: Fed lowered rates quickly, then moved to alternative stimulation (learning from 1930s mistakes when Fed was slower to ease and even tightened to defend dollar's gold peg)

### Debt Defaults Hit Like an Avalanche

- **Banks face runs** — justified fears feed on themselves, institutions without cash to meet withdrawals fail unless government-protected
- **Interest rate cuts don't work** — risk-free rates already hit floor, credit spreads rise, making risky debt service harder
- **Liquidity becomes critical concern** — high ratio of financial assets to money means massive conversion demand during panics; central bank must print money or allow defaults

### Solvency vs. Cash-Flow Problems

**Solvency problem**: entity lacks enough equity capital (is "broke"), accounting/regulatory issue
**Cash-flow problem**: entity lacks cash to meet needs (often from "run"), immediate and severe

- Cash-flow problems trigger most debt crises
- Both problem types often exist simultaneously
- Each requires different approach:
  - **Solvency**: provide equity capital OR change accounting/regulatory rules to hide problem
  - **Cash-flow**: provide cash OR guarantees

**1980s vs. 2008 banking crisis**: Less mark-to-market accounting in 1980s (loans not traded daily) meant banks appeared less insolvent. 2008 required capital injections/guarantees due to mark-to-market accounting.

### Systemic Protections Rarely Adequate

**Typical protections** (learned from past): deposit insurance, lender-of-last-resort supports, capital injections, nationalization

**Why they fall short**:
- Lending migrates to unregulated **"shadow banking system"**
- New instruments have unanticipated risks and inadequate regulations
- Exact nature of crisis not well thought through in advance
- Success depends on policymaker capabilities and freedom to act

### Depressions Are Not Primarily Psychological

**Common misconception**: investors scared, moving money from risky to safe assets; restore confidence → restore economy

**Reality**: deleveraging driven by supply/demand of credit, money, goods/services — not mainly psychology

> "If everyone went to sleep and woke up with no memory of what had happened, we would be in the same position, because debtors' obligations to deliver money would be too large relative to the money they are taking in."

**Credit creation/destruction**:
- Credit appears "out of thin air" in good times (store credit card example)
- Credit disappears same way when promises won't be kept
- Much "wealth" was merely promises to give money — deleveraging reveals this

**Panic-induced runs test ability to get paid** — when conversion fails, sell-offs cascade, especially hitting entities relying on short-term funding

### The Self-Reinforcing Deleveraging Spiral

**Dynamic**: Income/borrowing insufficient to meet obligations → sell assets, cut spending → asset values fall, collateral value drops, incomes decline → creditworthiness judged by (assets/debt) and (income/debt-service) ratios → both net worth and income fall faster than debts → lenders more reluctant → self-reinforcing

**Depression phase dominated by**: deflationary forces (defaults, restructurings, austerity) WITHOUT material money printing to offset debt burdens

### Leverage Magnifies Write-Down Impact

**Example**: 30% debt write-down
- Creditor's assets reduced 30%
- But if creditor leveraged 2:1 → **60% decline in net worth** (assets = 2x net worth)
- Banks typically leveraged 12:1 or 15:1 → **devastating** for them and economy

**Debt burdens rise even as debts written down** — spending/incomes fall faster; debt-to-income and debt-to-net-worth ratios rise, making credit contraction self-reinforcing on downside

**Capitalist-investor class devastated**:
- Investment portfolios collapse (~50% equity price declines typical)
- Earned incomes fall
- Higher tax rates
- Response: defensive — move money out of country (currency weakness), dodge taxes, seek liquid non-credit assets (government bonds, gold, cash)

### Real Economy and Social Catastrophe

With monetary policy constrained, uncontrolled credit contraction produces:
- **Workers**: income collapse, severe job losses, loss of meaningful work → destitution or dependence
- **Families**: lose homes (can't pay mortgages), retirement accounts wiped out, college savings lost
- Can persist many years without sufficient monetary stimulation

## Managing Depressions

### Four Broad Policy Categories

1. **Austerity**
2. **Debt defaults/restructurings**
3. **Debt monetization/money printing**
4. **Wealth transfers** (haves to have-nots)

**Key**: get the mix right so deflationary/depressive forces balance with inflationary/stimulative ones

### Why Policy Makers Get the Mix Wrong Initially

**Taxpayer anger**: don't want taxes bailing out debtors and institutions whose excesses caused crisis

**Moral hazard concern**: lenders/borrowers must suffer downsides or excesses will recur

**Result**: policymakers reluctant, slow to provide support → debt contraction and agony increase quickly

**Eventually**: after ~couple years of unnecessary pain, decisive action taken with guarantees, money printing, debt monetization → lifts economy into reflationary deleveraging

**Success examples**:
- Short "depression" following US 2008 crisis (acted quickly)
- **Failure examples**: Great Depression 1930s, Japan's "lost decade" post-late-1980s bubble

> **The two biggest impediments to managing a debt crisis are: a) the failure to know how to handle it well and b) politics or statutory limitations on the powers of policy makers to take the necessary actions.** In other words, *ignorance and a lack of authority are bigger problems than debts themselves.*

**Policy making harder than investing**:
- Investors: understand machine, anticipate next
- Policy makers: must do that PLUS navigate political impediments requiring smarts, willingness to fight, political savvy, heroism
- Even with all that, constraints may prevent success

## Austerity

**Why tried first**: natural desire to make those responsible bear costs

**Problem**: even deep austerity doesn't rebalance debt/income — when spending cut, incomes also cut; takes "awful lot of painful spending cuts" for significant debt/income reduction

**Government revenue falls, demands increase** during contraction → deficits increase despite fiscal responsibility attempts → governments raise taxes

**Both moves are big mistakes.**

## "Printing Money" to Stop Bleeding and Stimulate

**Runs on unprotected institutions** force decisions: which depositors/lenders/institutions to protect from losses, which to let sustain them, which systemically important to save

**Money comes from**: government (budget appropriation) and/or central banks ("printing")

**Governments do both** in varying degrees, providing money to:
- Essential banks
- Essential nonbank entities

### Three Immediate Actions When Systemically Important Institutions at Risk:

1. **Curtail panic and guarantee liabilities** — increase deposit/debt guarantees; inject money into systemically important institutions; occasionally force deposit freezes (undesirable but sometimes necessary)

2. **Provide liquidity** — central bank lends against widening collateral range to widening range of institutions not normally in their lending practices

3. **Support solvency of systemically important institutions**:
   - Incentivize private sector (support mergers of failed/healthy banks, regulatory pushes for more capital)
   - Accounting adjustments to reduce immediate capital need, buying time
   - **Recapitalize/nationalize/cover losses** when above insufficient — must stabilize lenders and maintain credit supply; certain institutions are "plumbing of the system" — lose them even if unprofitable → like losing shipping port in depression

### While Monetary Stimulus Critical, It's Typically Not Sufficient

**Policy makers must act immediately to**:
- Curtail panic, guarantee liabilities
- Provide liquidity (widening collateral/institutions)
- Support solvency of systemically important institutions

**Money printing alone inadequate** — modest initial attempts fail → progressively larger doses applied → early efforts cause temporary relief (bear-market rallies in stocks, increased activity)

**Great Depression example**: six big stock rallies (16%-48%) in 89% total decline bear market, all triggered by government actions to reduce imbalance

**Shift from depression to expansion** via well-managed money printing, asset purchases, guarantees

## Debt Defaults/Restructurings

**Ultimate necessity**: cleansing bad debts critical for future money/credit flow and return to prosperity

**Best-managed cases**:
- Swiftly recognize credit problem magnitude
- Don't save every expendable institution (balance benefits of allowing failures vs. risks of detrimental effects on other creditworthy entities)
- Create/restore robust credit pipes for future creditworthy borrowing
- Ensure acceptable growth/inflation while bad debts worked out

**Longer term key decision**: fix root causes of debt problems OR simply restructure debts to distribute pain over population/time

### Resolution Typically Slow and Inadequate Initially

**Pattern**: policy makers fail to recognize magnitude initially → enact insufficient one-off policies → only after "usually a couple of years and a lot of unnecessary economic pain" do they act decisively

**Speed and aggressiveness** of response = most important factor determining severity/length of depression

**Cost allocation** among government (society), bondholders (various seniorities), equity holders, depositors = important question

### Handling Nonsystemically Important Institutions

**Forced to absorb losses** — allowed to fail/go bankrupt if nonsystemically important

**Resolution forms**:
- **Mergers with healthy institutions** (~80% of studied cases)
- **Asset liquidation or transfer to government AMC** (Asset Management Company) for piecemeal sale

### Handling Systemically Important Institutions

**Banking system level measures**: liquidity/solvency support increasingly common in developed world; sometimes government-financed recapitalization across all banks (not just systemically important)

### Clear Lines for Creditor Protections:

1. **Small depositors**: minimal/no losses in nearly every case via deposit insurance (coverage often expanded during crisis); ~30% of cases saw depositor losses (often foreign-exchange deposits via below-market conversion)

2. **When institutions fail**: equity, subordinated debt, large depositors absorb losses regardless of systemic importance (senior/subordinated debt holder protections, dilutive equity recaps mostly in developed world)

3. **Domestic creditors sometimes prioritized over foreign** (especially private-sector, lower-capital-structure loans) as deposit insurance runs low; BUT governments often prioritize **IMF and BIS loans** to maintain availability of support from these lender-of-last-resort public entities

### Regulatory Reforms Accompany Lender Resolution

**Range**: modest to very large, better to worse
- Bank operation changes (1930s deposit guarantees, 2010 Dodd-Frank/Volcker)
- Credit standards improvements
- Opening banking to competition (including foreign)
- Raising capital requirements, removing lender protections
- Labor market reforms

**Politics determines reforms** — can distort market-based lending incentives (limiting creditworthy credit flow, increasing future risks) OR improve credit flow, protect households, reduce future debt problems

### Managing Bad Assets: Two Main Approaches

**40% of cases**: transfer to separate AMC for restructuring/disposal
**60% of cases**: remain on original lender's balance sheet

**Disposal levers**:
- Restructuring (extended terms)
- Debt-for-equity swaps, asset seizures
- Direct sales to third parties
- Securitizations

### AMC Benefits

**Accelerates debt problem management** — frees existing banks to return to lending, consolidates bad debts to centralized entity for sales/restructurings

**Transfer mechanism for wealth to banks** — pricing above market prices

**Publicly owned**, mandated to sell within targeted timeframe (e.g., 10 years) minimizing taxpayer costs and market disruptions:
- Quickly sell performing assets
- Work over time to manage/sell nonperforming assets
- Some have explicit goals to restructure nonperforming debts to reduce debt burdens

**Financed** by direct/pseudo-government debt; can't work well when legal/political/funding constraints limit bad debt recognition/restructuring ability

**Original lender manages bad debts when**: state-sponsored (closer to public AMC), losses not too large, technical expertise for centralized AMC lacking, effective resolution mechanisms already exist

### Systemically vs. Strategically Important Borrower Distinction

**Systemically/strategically important**: keep businesses intact via debt restructuring (debt-for-equity swaps, debt reduction, lower rates, terming out); occasionally new lending programs for ongoing liquidity

**Nonsystemically important**: restructure with private lenders or allow bankruptcy/liquidation

**Household sector**: governments/AMCs often take steps to reduce debt burdens vs. foreclosing (part of maximizing recovery values)

### Frequency of Policy Levers (48 Historical Cases)

**Liquidity Support**: Emergency Lending 88%, Bank Guarantees 58%, Deposit Freeze 21%
**Insolvent Lenders**: Bank Restructuring/Mergers 81%, Recapitalization 73%, Nationalizations 60%, Losses on Depositors 29%
**Bad Debts**: Asset Purchases/Transfers 44%, Centralized AMCs 38%
**Sovereign Issues**: Default/Restructuring 35%, IMF Program 52%

## Redistributing Wealth

**Wealth gaps increase during bubbles**, particularly galling for less privileged during hard times

**Political/economic conflict risk**: if rich share budget with poor during downturn → populism emerges (left and right)

**US historical parallel**: today's inequality/populism matches 1930s levels (top 0.1% net worth ≈ bottom 90% combined in both eras)

**Tax increases on rich politically attractive** because:
- Rich made money in boom (especially financial sector)
- Perceived to have caused problems via greed
- Central bank asset purchases disproportionately benefit rich (who own more such assets)

**Big leftward political shifts** hasten redistributive efforts, driving rich to move money to protected locations → currency/asset market effects → economic "hollowing out" (big earners = big taxpayers leave → revenue drops, property values/services decline)

**Typical increased taxation**: income, property, consumption taxes (most effective revenue raisers)

**Wealth/inheritance taxes** sometimes increased but raise little (wealth often illiquid, difficult to collect; forcing liquid asset sales undermines capital formation)

**Transfers rarely contribute meaningfully to deleveraging** (unless "revolutions" with massive property nationalization)

## 5) The "Beautiful Deleveraging"

### Definition and Mechanics

A **beautiful deleveraging** occurs when the four policy levers are balanced to reduce shocks, produce positive growth with falling debt burdens, and maintain acceptable inflation. Specifically: enough stimulation (money printing/debt monetization and currency devaluation) offsets deflationary deleveraging forces (austerity/defaults) and brings nominal growth above nominal interest rates—but not so much that inflation accelerates or a new debt bubble forms.

### Central Bank Role in Negating Deflation

Best approach: central bank provides adequate liquidity and credit support; central government provides capital as needed. When spending can't be financed with debt (too much debt relative to money available to service it), increased spending and debt-service relief must come from increased money—the central bank must expand the money supply.

**Central bank mechanisms:**
- Lending against wider range of collateral (lower quality, longer maturity)
- Buying (monetizing) lower-quality and/or longer-term debt
- Right amounts: a) neutralize deflationary credit market collapse, b) get nominal growth marginally above nominal interest rate to spread out deleveraging

### Income Growth vs. Debt Growth

For debt burdens not to increase, **nominal income growth must exceed nominal interest rates**.

**Example:** Country with 100% debt-to-income ratio and 2% interest rate. If no debt repaid, debt becomes 102 after one year. If income grows 1%, it reaches 101, so debt burden increases from 100/100 to 102/101. The higher nominal income growth is above nominal interest rates, the better (provided it doesn't produce unacceptable inflation/currency declines).

### Why Money Printing Won't Necessarily Cause Inflation

> "People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won't if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this reflationary force. That's not a theory—it's been repeatedly proven out in history."

**Key insight:** A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices as a dollar paid for with credit. Money printing makes up for credit disappearance. Traditional economists see velocity of money declining, but what's happening is **credit destruction being offset by money creation**. If the balance is right, this isn't inflationary.

### Risk of Abusive Stimulants

Because stimulants work so well relative to alternatives, **real risk of "ugly inflationary deleveraging"** (Weimar hyperinflation 1920s, Argentina and Brazil 1980s). Key: avoid printing too much money. Achieving balance is harder in countries with:
- Large percentage of debt denominated in foreign currency
- Debt owned by foreign investors
- Cannot easily monetize or restructure such debt (as in Weimar Germany and South American countries)

### Historical Pattern: Money Printing Is Inevitable

Printing money/debt monetization and government guarantees are **inevitable in depressions where interest rate cuts won't work**, though these tools have little value in countries:
- Constrained from printing
- Don't have assets to back printing
- Can't easily negotiate redistributions of debt burdens

All past deleveragings (most over past hundred years) eventually led to **big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations** (against gold, commodities, and stocks). Policy makers varied which levers they used based on their monetary systems.

**Chart shows archetypal money printing path over 21 cases:**
- Two classic waves:
  1. Central banks provide liquidity to stressed institutions (initial liquidity injection)
  2. Large-scale asset purchases to broadly stimulate economy

### Currency Devaluation Patterns

Governments with **gold-, commodity-, or foreign-currency-pegged money systems** are forced to have tighter monetary policies to protect currency value. But eventually debt contractions become so painful they relent, break the link, and print (abandon systems or change commodity pricing).

**Example:** During Great Depression, suspending promise to convert dollars into gold so currency could be devalued and more money created was key to creating bottoms in stock and commodity markets and economy. 2008 financial crisis easier—didn't require legalized currency regime change.

**Gold price pattern:** In US Great Depression, gold rose overnight when Roosevelt broke gold peg; in recent financial crisis, Fed moves pushed down dollar value versus all currencies, including gold.

> "In the end, policy makers always print. That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit, big restructurings wipe out too much wealth too fast, and transfers of wealth from haves to have-nots don't happen in sufficient size without revolutions."

**Historical comparison:** Those who did it quickly and well (US in 2008-09) derived much better results than those who did it late (US in 1930-33).

### Typical Magnitudes Required

On average to create turn from depression to beautiful deleveraging:
- **Money printing:** ~4% of GDP per year
- **Currency devaluation:** ~50% against gold initially
- **Fiscal deficits:** widen to ~6% of GDP
- **Timing:** This aggressive stimulation comes 2-3 years into depression, after stocks fallen 50%+, economic activity fallen ~10%, unemployment risen to 10-15%

**Note:** When monetary and fiscal policies rolled out faster and smarter, results much better than these averages.

### Key to Beautiful Deleveraging

Balance inflationary forces against deflationary ones. Right amounts:
- a) Neutralize deflationary credit-market collapse
- b) Get nominal growth rate above nominal interest rate enough to relieve debt burdens, but not so much it leads to run on debt assets

### Summary: Well-Managed vs. Poorly-Managed Phases

**BUBBLE - Well Managed:**
- Central banks consider debt growth and asset market effects in policy
- Use macroprudential policies to target restraints where bubbles emerging, allow debt growth where not excessive
- Fiscal policies tightened

**BUBBLE - Poorly Managed:**
- Big bubbles fueled by speculators/lenders over-extrapolating, central banks focusing only on inflation/growth, not debt bubbles in investment assets
- Credit kept cheap too long

**TOP - Well Managed:**
- Central banks constrict bubble with broad monetary policy or macroprudential policies, then ease selectively

**TOP - Poorly Managed:**
- Central banks continue tightening well after bursting bubble

**DEPRESSION - Well Managed:**
- Central banks provide ample liquidity, ease short rates quickly to 0%, then pursue aggressive monetizations and macroprudential policies
- Governments pursue aggressive sustained fiscal stimulus
- Systemically important institutions protected

**DEPRESSION - Poorly Managed:**
- Central banks slower to cut rates, provide limited liquidity, tighten too early, wait too long for aggressive monetization
- Governments pursue austerity without adequate easing
- Systemically important institutions left damaged or failed

**BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING - Well Managed:**
- Reflations begin with aggressive monetizations through asset purchases or big currency declines, enough to bring nominal growth above nominal rates
- Stimulative macroprudential policies protect systemically important entities and stimulate high-quality credit growth
- Nonsystemically important institutions allowed to fail orderly
- Policy makers balance depressive forces (defaults/austerity) with reflationary forces (debt monetization, currency declines, fiscal stimulus)

**BEAUTIFUL DELEVERAGING - Poorly Managed:**
- Initial monetizations stutter and start; asset purchases more muted and consist more of cash-like instruments rather than risky assets, so don't produce wealth effect; stimulation undermined by fiscal austerity
- Overindebted entities protected even though not systemically important, leading to zombie banks and malaise
- Ugly inflationary depressions arise when policy makers allow faith in currency to collapse and print too much money

## 6) "Pushing on a String"

### When Monetary Stimulus Loses Effectiveness

Late in long-term debt cycle, central bankers sometimes struggle to convert stimulative policies into increased spending because **effects of lowering interest rates and central banks' purchases of debt assets have diminished**. Economy enters period of low growth and low returns on assets. Central bankers must move to other forms of **monetary stimulation in which money and credit go more directly to support spenders**.

**"Pushing on a string"** (1930s phrase): Biggest risk at this stage is too much printing of money/monetization and too severe currency devaluation relative to deflationary alternatives, producing "ugly inflationary deleveraging."

### Three Types of Monetary Policy

#### Monetary Policy 1 (MP1): Interest-Rate Driven

**Most effective because broadest impact on economy.** When central banks reduce interest rates, they stimulate by:
- a) Producing positive wealth effect (lower rate raises present value of investments)
- b) Making items easier to buy on credit (monthly payments decline), raising demand for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing
- c) Reducing debt-service burdens (improves cash flows and spending)

**MP1 typically first approach** to debt crisis, but when short-term interest rates hit around 0%, it no longer works effectively—central banks must move to second type.

#### Monetary Policy 2 (MP2): Quantitative Easing

**"Printing money" and buying financial assets, typically debt assets.** Works by affecting behavior of investors/savers (not borrowers/spenders), because driven by purchases of financial assets.

When central bank buys a bond, it gives savers/investors cash, which they typically use to buy another financial asset they think is more attractive. **What they do with that money and credit makes all the difference.** When they invest in assets that finance spending, that stimulates economy. When they invest in assets that don't (such as financial assets), there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who enjoyed market gains than those who haven't.

**Result:** QE benefits investors/savers (those who own financial assets) much more than people who don't, **thus widening the wealth gap**.

**MP2 effectiveness:** Generally less effective than interest-rate changes, but most effective when risk and liquidity premiums are large—causes those premiums to fall. When risk premiums large and money added to system, actual risks reduced at same time there is more money seeking returns, triggering purchases of riskier assets offering higher expected returns, driving prices up and producing positive wealth effect.

**Diminishing returns over time:** Risk premiums pushed down and asset prices pushed up to levels beyond which difficult to push further, and wealth effect diminishes. **At higher prices and lower expected returns, compensation for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up, which would drive prospective returns down further.** Reward-to-risk ratio could make cash more appealing. **If QE provided and private credit growth doesn't pick up, policy makers feel like pushing on a string.**

At this stage, policy makers sometimes monetize debt in even larger quantities to compensate for declining effectiveness. **Real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question currency's suitability as store hold of value**, leading to moves to alternative currencies like gold.

### The Fundamental Economic Challenge

**The claims on purchasing power are greater than the abilities to meet them.**

There are only goods and services. **Financial assets are claims on them.** Holders of investments/assets (investors/capitalists) believe they can convert holdings into purchasing power. Workers expect to exchange a unit's worth of contribution for buying power. But **since debt/money/currency have no intrinsic value, the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy**—so they have to be devalued or restructured.

When too many debt liabilities/assets, they either have to be reduced via debt restructurings or monetized. Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because **stimulative rather than contractionary**. But **monetization simply swaps one IOU (debt) for another (newly printed money)**. Situation analogous to a **Ponzi scheme**. Since there aren't enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs, there's a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever.

**Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose structural challenge for monetary policy.** With MP1 (interest rates) and MP2 (QE) at their limits, central bank has very little ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—**monetary policy has little "gas in the tank."** This typically happens in later years of long-term debt cycle (e.g., 1937-38 and now in the US), which can lead to "pushing on a string." When this happens, policy makers need to look beyond QE to **Monetary Policy 3**.

#### Monetary Policy 3 (MP3): Direct Money to Spenders

**Puts money more directly into hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it.** Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend incremental money/credit than less wealthy people, when wealth gap is large and economy is weak, **directing spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive**.

**Continuum of actions with varying degrees of control:**
- **Coordinated fiscal and monetary actions:** Fiscal policy makers provide stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities to spend
- **"Helicopter money":** Central bank sends cash directly to citizens without coordination with fiscal policy makers

Typically coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services. Central banks can also exert influence through **macroprudential policies** that help shape things in ways similar to how fiscal policies might.

**Forms of MP3:**

- **Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending** (sometimes paired with QE that buys most of new issuance): Japan 1930s, US during WWII, US and UK in 2000s

- **Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending where Treasury isn't on hook for debt** because:
  - Central bank can print money to cover debt payments (Germany 1930s)
  - Central bank can lend to entities other than government for stimulus projects (lending to development banks in China in 2008)

- **Not bothering to issue debt, instead giving newly printed money directly to government to spend** (printing fiat currency in Imperial China, American Revolution, US Civil War, Germany 1930s, UK during WWI; or debasing hard currency in Ancient Rome, Imperial China, 16th-century England)

- **Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households ("helicopter money")**: Directing money into hands of spenders (US veterans' bonuses during Great Depression, Imperial China). Money can be directed same amount to everyone or aim to help one or more groups over others (giving to poor rather than rich). Money can be provided as one-off or over time (perhaps as universal basic income). Variants can be paired with incentive to spend it (money disappears if not spent within a year). Money could also be directed to specific investment accounts (retirement, education, accounts earmarked for small-business investments) targeted toward socially desirable spending/investment. Another way: **distribute returns/holdings from QE to households instead of to government**.

- **Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation** ("year of Jubilee"): Ancient Rome, Great Depression, Iceland

**Most effective approaches involve fiscal/monetary coordination**, because ensures both providing and spending of money will occur. If central banks just give people money (helicopter money), typically less adequate than giving them money with incentives to spend it. However, sometimes difficult for those who set monetary policy to coordinate with those who set fiscal policy—in which case other approaches used.

Also, **sometimes policies don't fall exactly into these categories**, as they have elements of more than one. For example, if government gives tax break, that's probably not helicopter money, but depends on how it's financed. Government can also spend money directly without loan financed by central bank—that is helicopter money through fiscal channels.

### Macroprudential Policies

While central banks influence costs and availabilities of credit for economy as whole, they also have **powers to influence costs and availabilities of credit for targeted parts of financial system through their regulatory authorities**. These **macroprudential policies** especially important when desirable to differentiate entities—e.g., when desirable to restrict credit to overly indebted area while simultaneously stimulating rest of economy, or when desirable to provide credit to some targeted entities but not broadly. Macroprudential policies take numerous forms valuable in different ways in all seven stages of big debt cycle. Because explaining them here would require too much digression, they are explained in some depth in the Appendix.

## 7) Normalization

Eventually the system gets back to normal, though **recovery in economic activity and capital formation tends to be slow, even during beautiful deleveraging**. Typically takes roughly **5 to 10 years** (hence "lost decade") for real economic activity to reach former peak level. Takes longer, around **a decade, for stock prices to reach former highs**, because takes very long time for investors to become comfortable taking risk of holding equities again (equity risk premiums are high).

**Recovery conditions (averages):**
- Length of equity drawdown: 119 months (range 60-249)
- Length of GDP drawdown: 72 months (range 25-106)
- Change in debt-to-GDP post-stimulation: -54% (range -70% to -29%)

**Recommended next steps:** Now that you have this template for deflationary depressions in mind, read the detailed accounts of US 2007-2011 and 1928-1937 big debt cycles shown in Part 2, then look at summary statistics and auto-text of 21 case studies shown in Part 3.

<!-- pp. 81-100 -->

## Which Countries/Currencies Are Most Vulnerable to Severe Inflationary Deleveragings or Hyperinflations?

### Vulnerability Factors
Countries most susceptible to inflationary depressions share key characteristics:
- **Don't have a reserve currency** (no global bias to hold their currency/debt as store of wealth)
- **Have low foreign-exchange reserves** (small cushion against capital outflows)
- **Have large foreign debt** (vulnerable to rising debt costs via interest rates or currency depreciation, or shortage of dollar-denominated credit)
- **Have large and increasing budget and/or current account deficit** (forcing need to borrow or print money)
- **Have negative real interest rates** (interest rates significantly below inflation, inadequately compensating lenders)
- **Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns** (eroding trust in currency/debt)

> "Generally speaking, the greater the degree to which these things exist, the greater the degree of the inflationary depression."

Most iconic case: **German Weimar Republic** (early 1920s), examined in Part 2.

**Reserve-currency countries** can still experience inflationary depressions, though less severe. They emerge more slowly after sustained overuse of stimulus to reverse deflationary deleveraging. Even reserve currencies can lose status if policy makers permit excessive inflation to maintain growth, undermining demand for the currency and turning deleveraging inflationary.

## The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

Archetype created by averaging **27 inflationary deleveragings** with significant foreign-currency-denominated debt. Five stages mirror deflationary deleveragings but differ in critical ways.

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle

**Healthy upswing driven by good fundamentals:**
- Country is competitive with potential for productive investment
- Debt levels low, balance sheets healthy
- Capital inflows fund productive investments yielding good returns
- Debt and incomes rise at comparable rates
- Strong debt and equity markets encourage borrowing and investing

**Capital flows are the most volatile and important flows to watch.** Positive self-reinforcing cycle: rising incomes make debt easier to service → early leveraging attracts more capital.

**Currency dynamics:** If currency cheap enough to attract foreign investors, country's balance of payments becomes favorable (demand for currency > supply). This makes central bank's job easier—can achieve more growth per unit of inflation by using inflows to:
- Appreciate the currency
- Lower interest rates
- Increase reserves

**Foreign-exchange reserves:** Central banks sometimes sell own currency for incoming foreign currency to prevent appreciation. Must invest acquired foreign currency in foreign bonds. Reserves are like savings—cushion currency movements and enable strategic asset purchases. Accumulating reserves stimulates economy by lessening upward currency pressure, maintaining export competitiveness, and injecting money into economy (via domestic currency creation to buy foreign currency).

### 2) The Bubble

Emerges during self-reinforcing cycle of strong capital flows, good returns, and strong conditions. Early productive capital investment leads to asset appreciation, attracting more capital. Currency and/or assets get bid up and increasingly debt-financed, making prices too high to produce adequate returns. Borrowing continues as prices rise, debts rise rapidly relative to incomes.

**Key bubble indicators:**
- Foreign capital flows around **10% of GDP**
- Central bank accumulating foreign-exchange reserves
- Real FX overvalued by around **15% on PPP basis**
- Stocks rally over **20% for several years** into peak

**Structural long currency positions build up** without participants fully recognizing it. Foreign businesses set up operations, hold deposits in local currency, don't hedge exposures. Local businesses borrow in weaker foreign currency (attractive to foreign lenders in hot market).

- Influx finances consumption boom
- Imports rise faster than exports, current account worsens

Rising incomes increase creditworthiness and willingness to borrow; lenders more willing to lend. High export prices (commodities) increase income and incentivize investment.

**Fundamental attractiveness fades** as rising currency erodes competitiveness. Growth increasingly financed by debt rather than productivity gains. Country becomes highly reliant on foreign financing.

**Bubble characteristics:**
- Debt to GDP rises at **~10% annual rate over three years**
- Foreign-currency debt rises to around **35% of total debt** and **45% of GDP**
- Economic activity very strong with GDP gap around **+4%**

Emerging countries borrow primarily from abroad in foreign currencies due to: underdeveloped local financial system, less faith in local currency, smaller domestic savings pool.

During bubble, debt as % of GDP rises from ~125% to ~150%, current account deteriorates by ~2% of GDP.

### 3) The Top and Currency Defense

**Balance of payments crisis and inflationary depression** begin when bubble bursts—flows causing bubble become unsustainable. Mirror-opposite spiral: weakening capital inflows and asset prices → deteriorating conditions → further capital/asset weakness.

Even minor event can trigger reversal when optimism is fully priced in. Worsening trade balances play a role (high currency, excessive consumption), but **adverse capital flow shifts usually more important.**

**Triggers for top-reversal:**
1. Income from selling goods/services to foreigners drops (currency made exports expensive; commodity prices fall)
2. Costs of items bought abroad or borrowing rise
3. **Declines in capital flows into country** (foreign investors reduce lending/investment) because:
   - Unsustainable pace naturally slows
   - Greater worries about economic/political conditions
   - **Tightening of monetary policy in local currency and/or currency debts are denominated in** (or tightening abroad creates pressure for capital to exit)
4. Country's own citizens want to get money out

Weakening capital flows directly reduce growth (less financing for investment and consumption), making borrowers less creditworthy and lenders less willing. Self-reinforcing weakness.

**Early indicators:**
- Growth slows relative to potential
- Domestic capital outflows pick up
- Export earnings fall (prices or quantities)

Shift in flows drives asset prices down and interest rates up, slowing growth dependent on inflows. Worsens company fundamentals, drives out more capital. Economy suffers debt bust—asset prices fall, banks fail.

**Policy maker dilemma:** Central bank's job becomes more difficult—gets less growth per unit of inflation as negative flows cause currency depreciation, interest rate increases, and/or reserve declines.

**Currency defense attempts:** Central banks try to defend currencies by:
- Spending down reserves, and/or
- Raising interest rates

**These defenses rarely work** because selling reserves and raising rates creates more opportunity for sellers without moving currencies/rates to sustainable levels.

**Critical relationship:** Interest rate differential and spot/forward currency pricing. Expected currency decline is priced into forward discount. If market expects 5% decline over a year, currency must yield 5% higher interest. **If market expects 5% decline in a month, needs 5% higher monthly rate = ~80% annual rate**—producing severe economic contraction.

Managed currency decline with falling reserves causes market to expect continued depreciation → pushes up domestic interest rates (tightening when economy already weak) → encourages capital withdrawals and devaluation speculation → forces more reserve spending. No sensible policy maker will run out of "savings."

Policy makers defending pegs typically make boldly confident statements vowing to stop weakening—all happening just before letting currency go.

**Forward/spot dynamics:** During defense, forward currency price declines ahead of spot (consequence of interest rate differential relationship). Country tightening to support currency just increases rate differential to artificially hold up spot. Forward continues declining relative to spot—whip-like effect where forward leads spot downward as rate differential increases. Spot eventually catches up after currency released, allowing rate differential to narrow and forward to rally relative to spot.

**Capital controls** are third (often last-ditch) lever. Can seem attractive (directly reduce outflows) but usually fail because:
- Investors find ways around them
- Trying to trap people makes them want to escape
- Analogous to inability to get money out of bank—can trigger run

Temporary fix at best, never sustained.

Currency defense phase typically **brief (around 6 months)**, with reserves drawn down **10-20%** before defense abandoned.

### 4) The Depression (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)

Unlike families, countries can change currency amount/value—**critical lever for managing balance of payments pressures.** Currency devaluation changes price of goods/services for foreigners at different rate than for citizens.

> "If a family's breadwinner lost his/her job and would have to take a 30 percent pay cut to get a new one, that would have a devastating economic effect on the family. But when a country devalues its currency by 30 percent, that paycut becomes a 30 percent pay cut only relative to the rest of the world; the wages in the currency the family cares about stay the same."

Currency declines allow countries to offer price cuts to world without domestic deflation.

After unsustainable defense (expending reserves, tightening, strong assurances, sometimes capital controls), **policy makers typically let currency decline** (though try to smooth fall).

**Typical post-release dynamics:**
- Big initial depreciation—around **30% decline in real terms**
- Not offset by tighter short rates, so currency holding losses significant (**~30% first year**)
- Policy makers try to smooth decline, continuing to spend reserves (another **~10% for year into bust**)

**Devaluation benefits (stimulative):**
- Assets rise in value measured in weakened currency
- Stimulates export sales
- Brings spending back in line with income (helps balance of payments adjustment)
- Lowers imports (more expensive), favoring domestic producers
- Makes assets competitively priced and attractive
- Creates better profit margins for exported goods
- Sets stage for earning more income from abroad through cheaper, competitive exports

Central banks should NOT defend currencies to point of depleting reserves or raising rates too high. **Devaluations are stimulative and helpful during contraction.** Dangers of over-defense exceed dangers of devaluation.

**But currency declines are double-edged swords.** How managed greatly impacts pain during adjustment:

**Risks of gradual/persistent decline:**
- Weakness translates to higher import prices → sharp inflation rise
- Market expects continued depreciation → encourages capital withdrawal and speculation
- Widens balance of payments gap, forces more reserve spending
- Makes inflation persistent, feeding inflation psychology

**Better approach: Large, one-off devaluation** achieving two-way market where no broad expectation of continued weakening. Higher inflation less likely sustained. If surprise (unexpected), policy makers don't have to spend reserves or allow rate rises to defend going into devaluation.

> "This is why policy makers generally say they'll continue to defend the currency right up until the moment they stop doing it."

After initial release, people push to exit currency positions. Many had acquired asset-liability mismatches (profitable at the time). Reversal becomes self-sustaining—when currency


<!-- pp. 101-120 -->

### Capital Flight and Economic Collapse

- When currency weakens, **capital suddenly becomes unavailable** and spending is forced to stop
- Ripple effects: one person's spending is another's income → job losses → less spending → growth halts
- Domestic banks face debt problems; foreigners become unwilling to lend
- **Capital inflows dry up fast** (more than 5% of GDP in under 12 months)
- Capital outflows continue at -3% to -5% of GDP
- Central bank money printing typically **cannot offset the pullback** in capital—printing risks enabling more people to exit the currency, worsening capital flight
- Weaker growth causes investors to pull money; assets shift from "fabulous treasure" to "trash" very quickly
- Nominal short rates rise (typically by ~20 percentage points); yield curve inverts
- Printing limited to 1-2% of GDP on average
- **Equities fall ~50% in local currency** terms; perform even worse in foreign currency as depreciation compounds the sell-off

### Foreign Currency Debt: The Critical Mismatch

- As local currency depreciates, **debtors with foreign-currency debt face rising debt burdens** (in local currency)
- Borrowers typically sell local currency to pay back debts, hedge positions, and move savings into foreign currency
- All these actions contribute to **further downward pressure** on the local currency
- **Debt service rises >5% of GDP** because incomes fall and FX-denominated debt becomes more expensive in local currency
- FX debt burdens rise ~20% on average due to falling incomes and currency depreciation
- Currency declines also **push up inflation** as imports become more expensive
- **Inflation rises typically by 15%**, peaking around 30%
- Inflation stays elevated for ~2 years from the top

### "Hitting Bottom" — The Catharsis Phase

- Pendulum swings from "everything looks great" to "everything looks terrible"
- Different problems reinforce each other: debt, economic, political, currency
- **Hidden problems surface**: fraudulent accounting, corruption typically exposed during this phase
- Bad environment discourages foreign capital inflows and encourages domestic capital flight

> "This is when countries usually 'hit the bottom.' The bottom is the mirror opposite of the bubble stage. While investors during the bubble are aggressively getting in, investors during the catharsis are aggressively getting out."

- Those losing money in asset/currency positions flee in panic; supply/demand imbalance creates shortage of buyers, surplus of sellers → prices plummet
- **Most severe and painful part** of inflationary deleveraging—downward spiral is self-reinforcing and rapid
- "Hitting bottom" is so painful it produces a **radical metamorphosis** in pricing and policies, ultimately creating the changes needed for recovery

> "That is why I use the word 'catharsis' when describing hitting bottom. In theater (or for that matter, in one's own personal life) crisis sows the seeds for change and ultimately renewal."

- Because currency becomes very cheap, **spending on imports is finally cut enough** to restore balance of payments
- Sometimes international aid (IMF, BIS, multinational organizations) creates necessary adjustments
- Often **big political shifts** occur: from fundamentally bad policies to economically sound ones

### Key Economic Developments at Bottom

- Economic activity (GDP gap) falls significantly (on average by ~8%)
- Unemployment rises
- Bottom in activity comes after ~1 year; GDP gap trough typically near -4%

### Phase 5: Normalization

- Reversal to normalcy occurs when **supply/demand balance is restored** for the currency relative to other currencies
- Balance primarily achieved through **capital flows** (not just trade adjustments)
- Normalization comes when central bank succeeds in **making it desirable to hold the currency again**; secondarily when spending/imports have fallen enough

### The Counterintuitive Currency Policy

- Most policy makers think the best thing is to **defend the currency** during the defense phase
- **Actually the opposite is true**: a currency level that is:
  - a) good for trade balance
  - b) produces positive total return
  - c) has appropriate interest rate for domestic conditions
  - **...is a LOW currency level**

> "The best way to bring that about is to let the currency depreciate sharply and quickly. While that will hurt those who are long that currency, it will make it more attractive for investors who will get long after the devaluation."

- At a sharply depreciated level, **total return becomes positive** without requiring an intolerably high interest rate
- This ensures positive expected returns at relatively low real interest rate (what weak domestic conditions need)

### The Cocaine Analogy

> "Devaluing currencies is like using cocaine, in that it provides short-term stimulation but is ruinous when abused."

- Watch what central banks do before deciding whether to take a long position
- If investors are burned with negative returns too long and currency keeps falling, that's frequently the **break-point** determining whether there will be an inflationary spiral
- Central bank objective: allow currency to get cheap enough for needed stimulation and balance of payments adjustment, while running tight enough policy to **make returns on owning the currency attractive**
- Returns to holding currency for foreigners start negative but rally about a year after devaluation

### Managing the Crisis — Even When Not at Debt Limits

- Even if country hasn't hit debt limits, certain entities within the country may have
- Policy makers must **recapitalize systemically important institutions** and provide targeted liquidity to manage bad debts
- Providing targeted liquidity (typically via printing money) can help avoid debt crisis that could cause additional capital flight
- But inflationary nature of money printing must be balanced carefully

### What Happens at the Bottom

- Collapse in imports improves current account significantly (~8% of GDP)
- Capital inflows stop declining and stabilize
- Capital flight abates
- Countries frequently turn to **IMF or international entities** for support and stable capital source, especially when reserves are limited
- Short rates start declining after ~1 year; long rates stay relatively elevated
- After peaking, short rates fall back to pre-crisis levels in ~2 years—the decline is stimulative
- As interest rates fall, forward currency price rallies relative to spot
- As currency stabilizes, **inflation comes down** (takes nearly 2 years after bottom to reach pre-crisis levels)

### Painful Adjustment Closes the Gap

- Sizable, painful decline in domestic conditions helps close balance of payments gap by reducing spending and imports
- Through crisis, average country's **imports contract by ~10%** as growth collapses and equity markets fall >50%
- Classically, collapse in imports brings current account into **surplus of 2% of GDP**, rising from deficit of -6% of GDP about 18 months into crisis
- Exports play smaller role in earlier stages; they actually tend to **contract during worst of crisis** (other countries seeing slowdowns too)
- Exports rebound in subsequent years

### Well-Managed vs. Poorly Managed Adjustments

**MANAGING THE CURRENCY**
- **Well-managed**: Policy makers bluff that they'll never allow currency to weaken much; when they devalue, it's a surprise; devaluation is large enough that people no longer broadly expect more weakening (creates two-way market)
- **Poorly managed**: Widely expected to allow weakness → more downward pressure and higher interest rates; initial devaluation is small, further devaluations needed → market expects this → higher interest rates and inflation expectations

**CLOSING EXTERNAL IMBALANCES**
- **Well-managed**: Tight monetary policy causes domestic demand to contract in line with income falls; policy makers create incentives for investors to stay in currency (higher interest rates compensating for depreciation risk)
- **Poorly managed**: Policy makers favor domestic conditions; monetary policy too loose → domestic pain delayed, inflation stoked; attempt to stop capital outflow with capital controls or restrictive measures

**SMOOTHING THE DOWNTURN**
- **Well-managed**: Use reserves judiciously to smooth foreign capital withdrawal while working to close imbalances
- **Poorly managed**: Rely on reserve sales to maintain higher spending levels

**MANAGING BAD DEBTS/DEFAULTS**
- **Well-managed**: Work through debts of over-indebted entities, making up gap with credit elsewhere
- **Poorly managed**: Allow disorderly defaults that lead to increased uncertainty and capital flight

### Recovery Timeline

- Takes a few years for country to recover
- Investors burned in last cycle are reluctant to return
- But price of domestic goods and labor fell with currency → country becomes **attractive destination for foreign investment**
- Higher exports and foreign direct investment kickstart growth
- If policy makers protect and recapitalize critical financial institutions, domestic financial pipelines support recovery
- Country returns to early part of cycle: new virtuous cycle where **productive investment opportunities attract capital** → capital drives up growth and asset prices → attracts more capital

**Recovery Metrics:**
- Incomes and spending pick up (usually after 1-2 years)
- Takes several years (usually ~3) from bottom before activity level returns to average
- **Real FX is undervalued** (typically by ~10% on PPP basis) at start of stabilization and stays cheap
- Exports pick up a bit (1-2% of GDP)
- Capital inflows return a few years later (on average 4-5 years)
- Equities take about same time to recover in foreign currency terms

## The Spiral from Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation

- While many policy makers can engineer recovery with transitory balance of payments crises, **subset of inflationary depressions spiral into hyperinflations**
- **Hyperinflations**: extreme inflation (goods/services prices more than doubling every year or worse) + extreme wealth losses + severe economic hardship
- More common than one might think

### The Critical Characteristic of Hyperinflations

**Policy makers don't close the imbalance between external income, external spending, and debt service, and keep funding external spending over sustained periods by printing lots of money.**

- Sometimes involuntary: **Weimar Germany** had crushing external debt service burden (war reparations) that couldn't be defaulted on
- Amount of capital that needed to flow out was so great that big inflation was nearly destined
- Other cases: policy makers choose to keep printing to cover external spending—aiming to prop up growth rather than bringing spending in line with income
- If done repeatedly over years at large scale, country may face avoidable hyperinflation

### Why It's Hard to Stop Printing

- Contrary to popular belief, **not easy to stop printing during crisis**
- Stopping printing when capital is flowing out can cause extreme liquidity tightness and deep economic contraction
- The longer crisis continues, the harder it becomes to stop printing
- **Weimar Germany example**: literally a shortage of cash because hyperinflation meant existing money stock could buy less and less
  - By late October 1923, Germany's entire 1913 money stock would have bought just "a one-kilo loaf of rye bread"
  - Stopping printing would have meant virtually no cash for commerce (until alternate currency emerged)
- In inflation spiral, printing money can seem like **prudent choice at the time**—but continuing to print feeds the spiral until there's no way out

### How the Spiral Plays Out

- Over time, as currency declines and printing increases, people shift behavior and **inflationary psychology sets in**
- Currency declines inspire additional capital flight → escalating feedback loop of depreciation, inflation, and money printing
- Eventually, linkages that drove growth in earlier rounds decline and **money printing becomes less effective**

**With each round of printing, more printed money is transferred to real or foreign assets instead of being spent on goods and services that fuel economic activity.**

- Investors who shorted cash and bought real/foreign assets repeatedly did better than those who saved/invested domestically
- Domestic currency holders shift from productive assets to **real assets (gold) and foreign currency** to hedge inflation and wealth deterioration
- Foreign investors stay away
- Because economy is weak and investors buying real assets, **stocks suffer** and no longer provide wealth effect that drove earlier spending
- Result: currency devaluation doesn't stimulate growth
- This dynamic is **important to inflationary deleveragings**

### The Wage-Cost Spiral

- When continual currency declines lead to persistent inflation, it becomes self-reinforcing, nurturing inflation psychology and changing behavior
- Key mechanism: inflation spreads to wages → **wage-cost spiral**
- Workers demand higher wages to compensate for reduced purchasing power
- Producers raise prices to compensate
- Sometimes happens mechanically through **wage indexing**—contracts where employers agree to increase wages with inflation
- Vicious cycle established: currency depreciates → internal prices rise → quantity of paper money increases → value of currency falls → prices rise again

### Behavioral Changes

- Savers, burned before, now move quickly to protect purchasing power
- Quicker to short cash and buy foreign and physical assets
- **Bank depositors want access on short notice** → shorten lending to banks
- Deposits move to short-term checking accounts rather than longer-term savings
- Investors shorten duration of lending or stop entirely (worried about default or worthless repayment)
- During inflationary deleveragings, **average debt maturities always fall**
- Also cheap to short cash (higher inflation and money printing lowers real interest rates) → withdrawal of capital and faster borrowing cause **illiquidity in financial system**
- Banks find it practically impossible to meet demand for cash
- No longer able to fulfill contracts due to cash shortages → businesses also suffer
- At this point, central banks face choice: extreme illiquidity vs. printing at accelerating rate
- Path is obvious: **print to provide liquidity**
- Print money to support banks, often lend directly to businesses
- When interest rates insufficient to compensate for future currency declines, this liquidity provision enables investors to continue borrowing and investing abroad and in inflation hedges (real assets, gold) → **further contributes to inflation and depreciation spiral**

### Rising Foreign Currency Debt Burdens

- Much of country's debt is foreign-currency-denominated
- Debt burdens rise when currency falls → requires spending cuts and asset sales
- While initially overcome by falling-currency stimulation, **becomes increasingly devastating** as that effect fades and debt burden grows
- Higher debt burdens mean foreign investors want higher interest rates as compensation for default risk
- Currency declines and inflation often **increase debt service and debt burdens**, making it harder to stimulate through currency

### Tax Evasion and Capital Flight

- Many governments respond to rising debt burdens by **raising taxes on income and wealth**
- With net worths eroding from bad economy and failing investments, wealthy desperately try to preserve rapidly shrinking wealth at all costs
- Leads to **extremely high rates of tax evasion** and increased capital flight abroad
- Typical in deleveragings

### Credit Creation Without Growth

- As growth weakens further, lack of foreign lending shuts down important source of credit creation
- Lots of domestic credit creation and borrowing, but **doesn't result in much growth**—so much spent abroad on foreign assets
- Of local spending, much doesn't contribute to GDP
- Example: investors buy lots of gold, factories, imports (even rocks in Weimar Republic!) as store holds of wealth
- Capital investments like machinery and tools purchased as **stores of value, not because they were needed**

### Complete Loss of Faith in Currency

- Easy to see how these forces create feedback mechanism: inflation and currency declines escalate until **people completely lose faith in currency**
- Money loses role as store of value (people hold at most a few days' reserves)
- Long list of zeros makes it impossible unit of account
- **Money breaks down as medium of exchange**: currency instability makes producers unwilling to sell for domestic currency; producers demand payment in foreign currencies or barter
- Shortage of foreign exchange → illiquidity peaks and demand collapses
- **This form of illiquidity can't be relieved by money printing**
- Stores close, unemployment rises
- As economy enters hyperinflation, **contracts rapidly** because currency declines that were once beneficial now just create chaos

### Hyperinflation's Wealth Destruction

- Economic contraction
- **Extreme wealth redistributions**: lenders see wealth inflated away, as do debtor's liabilities
- Chaos creates political tensions and clashes
- Frequently public servants (police officers) strike because they don't want to work for worthless paper money
- **Disorder, crime, looting, violence** typically reach peak during this phase
- **Weimar Germany**: government issued "state of siege," granting military greater power over domestic policies (arrests, breaking up demonstrations)

### Investment Principles During Hyperinflation

- Get short the currency
- Do whatever you can to get money out of country
- Buy commodities
- Invest in commodity industries (gold, coal, metals)
- **Buying equities is mixed bag**: investing in stock market becomes losing proposition as inflation transitions to hyperinflation
- Instead of high correlation between exchange rate and share prices, there's **increasing divergence**
- During this time **gold becomes preferred asset** to hold
- Shares are disaster even though they rise in local currency
- Bonds are wiped out

### Ending Hyperinflation

- Once inflationary deleveraging spirals into hyperinflation, **currency never recovers** its status as store hold of wealth
- Creating new currency with very hard backing while phasing out old currency is the classic path countries follow to end inflationary deleveragings

---

## War Economies

- War economies are **totally different from regular economies** in production, consumption, and accounting
- Increasing GDP from armaments production that get destroyed in war
- Reduced unemployment from increases in military service
- Shifts in production and profitability from top-down resource allocation
- Nature of borrowing, lending, capital flows differ from peace periods
- Understanding these statistics requires whole different orientation
- Trying to adequately convey how war economies work would take a whole different book

### The Economic/Geopolitical Cycle

- Cycle of economic conflicts leading to military conflicts between emerging/established powerful countries is **obvious to anyone who studies history**
- Well-described by historians (though typically from geopolitical perspective, less from economic/market perspective)
- Well-recognized as classic by historians

**When 1) within countries there are economic conflicts between the rich/capitalist/political right and the poor/proletariat/political left that lead to conflicts that result in populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders coming to power, while at the same time, 2)**
<!-- pp. 121-140 -->

## War Economies and Economic/Geopolitical Cycles

### Economic Rivalries and International Conflict

- When conflicts arise between comparably strong economic and military powers, economics and politics become especially intertwined—**probabilities of disruptive conflicts (wars) become much higher than normal**
- Economic rivalries within and between countries often lead to fighting to establish which entities are most powerful
- During wars: **war economies** emerge, followed by hangover effects on markets, economies, and geopolitics
- Wars profoundly affect currency values, debt burdens, equity valuations, and the entire **social-political fabric**
- After wars: extended **periods of peace** where dominant powers set rules because no one can challenge them—until the cycle begins again with a rival power emerging

### Economic/Geopolitical Cycle Timeline

- Understanding the big cycle of empire ascendancy/decline requires a **250-year time frame** (Dalio will explore in future report)
- At times of economic rivalry: **emotions run high**, **firebrand populist leaders** preferring antagonistic paths are elected, wars occur

### Two Types of International Relationships

**a. Cooperative-competitive relationships:**
- Parties consider what's important to the other, try to give it in exchange for what they want
- Tough negotiations done with respect and consideration
- Like "two friendly merchants in a bazaar or two friendly teams on the field"

**b. Mutually threatening relationships:**
- Parties think about how to harm the other, exchange painful acts
- Hope to force the other into a position of fear to make them give in
- Interact through "war" rather than "negotiation"

### Path Selection and Power Dynamics

- Either side can force the threatening/war path onto the other, but **both sides must cooperate** to maintain the win-win path
- Relative powers determine outcomes in both cases
- In cooperative relationships: parties should realize what the other could force on them and appreciate quality of exchange
- In threatening relationships: **power defined by relative abilities to endure pain vs. inflict it**
- When power balance is unclear (many untested ways to reward/punish), **cooperative path is safer**
- Threatening path will clarify—**through the hell of war**—which party is dominant and which must be submissive
- After wars: typically extended periods of peace with dominant country setting rules for as long as it takes for the cycle to repeat

### War Economy Priorities

**During wartime:**
- Most important priority: **maintain access to financial and non-financial resources** required to sustain a good war effort
- Countries must either borrow or have large foreign exchange reserves (cannot fund war + tolerable non-war spending from current income alone)
- Access to borrowing depends on: creditworthiness, capital market development, especially **soundness of local currency debt market**
- Maintaining access to critical non-financial resources (for war effort + acceptable domestic conditions) is essential

**Post-war period:**
- Market consequences of **debts and war outcome (won or lost) will be enormous**
- > "The worst thing a country, hence a country's leader, could ever do is get into a lot of debt and lose a war because there is nothing more devastating. ABOVE ALL ELSE, DON'T DO THAT. Look at what it meant for Germany after World War I in the 1920s (which is explained in Part 2) and for Germany and Japan after World War II in the late 1940s and the 1950s."

### Wartime Economic Shifts

**Typical patterns (charts show averages across war cases):**
- Government spending surges relative to private spending—**govt accounts for large share of total spending in wartime**
- Military personnel increases ~5x as % of population
- Military spending increases ~5x as % of GDP
- During WWII: **20% of US workforce shifted to military**

**Post-war adjustment:**
- Both winners and losers saddled with debt and need to transition from war-economy to normal economy
- Big contraction of military spending causes **postwar recession** (factories retooled, people formerly employed in war effort need new jobs)
- Countries enter periods of **deleveraging**, working through big war debts with same dynamics as other depressions/delevagings
- **Losers experience significantly worse economic conditions:**
  - Much deeper depression
  - Resort to more money printing
  - Spend down savings/reserves meaningfully
  - Much higher inflation rates (sometimes **hyperinflation**)

### Post-War Economic Divergence (Winners vs. Losers)

**Charts demonstrate patterns:**
- **Growth vs Potential:** Economy generally runs hot early on, then slows down (losing side suffers deeper recession)
- **Inflation:** Picks up on both sides early on, but diverges materially when losing side resorts to printing
- **Fiscal Balance:** Governments run sizable fiscal deficits to fund wartime spending
- **Money Supply:** Losing side resorts to significant money printing as situation becomes more dire
- **Reserves (USD, Est., Indexed):** Central banks accumulate war chest of reserves; losing side has to draw it down meaningfully

### Case Study References

- Dalio recommends: **Weimar Germany** and **US Great Depression** case studies in Part 2
  - Weimar: good picture of postwar period for a war loser
  - US Great Depression: shows how economic conflicts initiate sequence of events leading to shooting wars
- Also recommends: charts of **US and UK post-WWII** (examples of war winners)
- No charts for Germany, Japan, and other WWII losers post-1945: consequences for their currencies, markets, and economies were so devastating that **statistics were either ridiculously unreliable or unavailable**

## In Summary (Key Principles)

### Managing Debt Crises: Core Insight

> "I want to reiterate my headline: managing debt crises is all about spreading out the pain of the bad debts, and this can almost always be done well if one's debts are in one's own currency. The biggest risks are typically not from the debts themselves, but from the failure of policy makers to do the right things due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority. If a nation's debts are in a foreign currency, much more difficult choices have to be made to handle the situation well—and, in any case, the consequences will be more painful."

### Policy Maker Variation

- **Understandings and authorities** of policy makers varies greatly across countries
- Leads to dramatically different outcomes
- Policy makers tend not to react forcefully enough until crisis is extreme
- Authorities vary based on strength of regulatory and checks-and-balances systems
- **Trade-off:** Strong checks/balances bring benefits but also risk that required policy moves can't get done due to rigid rules and agreements

### The Impossibility of Perfect Rules

- Impossible to write rules well enough to anticipate all possibilities
- Even most knowledgeable and empowered policy maker unlikely to manage crisis perfectly
- Unforeseen circumstances must be responded to **instantly, often in hours**, within a legal/regulatory system lacking crystal-clear rules

### Checks and Balances: Double-Edged Sword

- Normally critical protection from too much concentration of power
- **Can exacerbate crisis** by slowing decision making and allowing those with narrower interests to block necessary policy moves
- Policy makers attempting bold actions typically **criticized from all sides**
- **Politics is horrendous during debt crises**—distortions and outright misinformation are pervasive

### Long-Run Perspective

- While big debt crises can be devastating over short to medium-term (3-10 years), **in the long run they fade in importance relative to productivity** (more forceful though less apparent because less volatile)
- **Political consequences** (e.g., increases in populism) from these crises **can be much more consequential than the debt crises themselves**
- Charts of real GDP per capita help put big debt crises (and "little" ones we call recessions) in perspective
- Contractions of >3% shown in shaded areas
- **Growth rates over time far more important than bumps along the way**
- Biggest bumps came more from **wars** than worst depressions (though wars were often caused by political fallout from depressions)

## PART 2: Detailed Case Studies

**Three case studies presented:**
1. German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918-1924)
2. US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1918-1924)
3. US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

## German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation (1918-1924)

### Overview

- Most **iconic inflationary depression cycle in history**
- German debt crisis and hyperinflation followed WWI end, carried into mid-1920s
- Set stage for economic and political changes of 1930s
- Similar to 2008 US Financial Crisis and 1930s Great Depression accounts
- Goes through particulars with reference to "Archetypal Inflationary Depression" template
- Though nearly a century ago amid exceptional political circumstances (Germany's WWI defeat + huge reparation burden from Allies), **basic dynamic of debt cycles, economic activity, and markets drove what happened**
- Differences between inflationary vs. deflationary depression cases highlight what makes some inflationary and others deflationary
- Includes newsfeed at end of chapter for vivid sense of real-time events

## July 1914–November 1918: World War I

### War Setup

- WWI (July 1914–November 1918) set stage for this big, dramatic cycle
- During war years Germany:
  - Left the gold standard
  - Accumulated large stock of domestic and foreign debts
  - Began money printing to finance ever-growing fiscal deficits
  - Experienced first bout of currency depreciation and inflation
- Germans expected short war based on Franco-Prussian War of 1870 experience
- Assumed war would ultimately be paid for by large indemnities levied on defeated Allied powers
- Instead: **extremely long and expensive affair** financed primarily through domestic debt
- Germany ended up having to **pay a huge war reparation bill rather than collecting one**

### Classic War Debt Pattern

- Classic case of war debts built up by a country that loses the war (more extreme than most)
- Classic case of country with **large foreign currency denominated debt held by foreign creditors**
- Knowing "Archetypal Inflationary Depression" dynamics from Part 1, you should have good idea how this story will play out

### Background: Gold Standard Era

- Like most countries at the time, Germany had been on **gold standard** at beginning of war
- All paper currency, including government debt, was **convertible to gold at a fixed rate**
- However, by 1914, the central bank didn't have enough gold to back the stock of money in circulation at the fixed price (as one might expect)
- As soon as war broke out: **smart German citizens rushed to exchange paper money for bullion**—caused run on banking system
- Within weeks: central bank (Reichsbank) and Treasury paid out **195 million marks' worth of gold** to public (~10% of total gold reserves)
- To prevent further losses, ensure liquidity in banking system, avoid major money supply contraction: policy makers **suspended conversion of money to gold on July 31, 1914**
- Government also authorized Reichsbank to buy short-term Treasury bills and use them + commercial bills as collateral for money it was printing
- Pace of printing rapid: by end of August, **quantity of Reichsbank notes in circulation increased ~30%**

### Currency as Medium of Exchange and Store of Wealth

- Classic dynamic: **Currency is both medium of exchange and store hold of wealth**
- When investors hold many promises to deliver currency (i.e., lots of debt denominated in a currency) and supply of that currency is tied to something that backs it, the central bank's ability to produce currency is limited
- When investors want to convert bonds to currency/money and spend it: puts central bank in difficult position of choosing between:
  - Lot of debt defaults, OR
  - Floating lot of currency (which can debase its value)

> "So, whenever (a) the amount of money in circulation is much greater than the amount of gold held in reserves to back the money at the designated price of conversion, and (b) investors are rushing to convert money into gold because they are worried about the value of their money, the central bank is in the untenable position of either reducing the supply of money in circulation (i.e., tighten credit) or ending convertibility and printing more money."

- Central banks almost always choose suspending convertibility and printing more money versus allowing credit contraction, **because it's less painful**

### Money Printing and Currency Depreciation Effects

- Printing lots of money and depreciating currency causes just about anything denominated in that depreciated money to go up in price
- People like it when things they own go up in value and they have more money to spend
- Also true in times of war
- Policy makers marshaling economic resources toward war effort print money to give themselves more to spend
- Printing helps prevent:
  - Liquidity crisis in banking system
  - Economic contraction from taking place
- Either would be very disruptive to war effort
- **Most countries fighting in WWI ended up suspending gold standard at one point or another**

### Financing the War

- Fighting war required German government to significantly increase expenditures (**government spending as share of GDP increased 2.5x between 1914 and 1917**)
- Financing this spending meant either:
  - Raising new revenues (taxation), OR
  - Increasing government borrowing

> "As there was huge resistance to increasing taxation at home, and as Germany was mostly locked out of international lending markets, the war had to be financed by issuing domestic debt."

- In 1914: German government debt was insignificant
- By 1918: Germany had amassed total local currency debt stock of **100 billion marks, about 130% of German GDP**

### Debt Denomination: Local vs. Foreign Currency

- Although debt stock was huge, prior to German surrender and imposition of war reparations, **most was denominated in local currency**
- Policy makers recognized this was a good thing
- According to Reichsbank: > "the greatest weakness in the war financing of the enemies is their growing indebtedness abroad [particularly to the US]"—forces them to scramble for dollars when needing to make debt-service payments
- In contrast, most German debt taken on to finance the war (prior to reparations) was **in local currency and financed by Germans**

### Public Willingness to Finance War (1914-1916)

- Until second half of 1916: German public both willing and able to finance entire fiscal deficit by purchasing government debt
- War bond issuances regularly **oversubscribed**
- However, as war dragged on and inflation accelerated: Treasury found public no longer prepared to hold all debt it was issuing
- Partly due to size of deficit (increasing substantially as war progressed)
- Also because **wartime inflation had caused real interest rates to become very negative** (government war bonds paid fixed 5% interest throughout war, whereas inflation had climbed above 30% by early 1915)
- Result: **lenders not adequately compensated** for holding government debt
- Inflation driven by:
  - Wartime disruptions and shortages
  - Capacity constraints in key war industries
  - Currency weakness (mark fell ~25% against dollar by 1916)
- While some naive lenders clung to hope that:
  - Government would return to gold standard at old exchange rate once war over, OR
  - Compensate them for losses due to inflation
- Others feared they would most likely be paid in money that had lost most of its purchasing power, so they **ran out of debt denominated in that currency**

### Debt Monetization Spiral

- Currency remained effective medium of exchange while losing effectiveness as store hold of wealth
- So: government borrowed money to pay for war expenditures, and Reichsbank was forced to **monetize the debt** as investors came up short in supplying the money
- Effect: **increased money supply** by amount equal to fiscal deficit not financed by public

> "As debt monetization is inflationary (there is more money in the economy chasing the same quantity of goods and services), a self-reinforcing spiral ensued—i.e., debt monetization increased inflation, which reduced real interest rates, which discouraged lending to the government, which encouraged additional debt monetization."

- As deficit was huge (averaging ~40% of GDP between 1914-1918): led to **money supply increasing by almost 300% over course of war**

### Money Creation Acceleration (1917-1918)

- Pace of money creation accelerated after 1917 as German citizens became increasingly unwilling to purchase government debt
- Central bank forced to monetize growing share of deficit
- Although number of marks in circulation almost doubled between mid-1917 and mid-1918: **did not cause material decline in currency**
- In fact: **mark rallied** over this period as Russia's withdrawal increased expectations of German victory
- Mark only began falling in second half of 1918 as German defeat began looking increasingly likely

### Foreign Currency Borrowing (Last Two Years)

- In last two years of war: German government began **borrowing in foreign currencies** because lenders unwilling to take promises to pay in marks
- > "When a country has to borrow in a foreign currency, it's a bad sign."
- By 1918: Reichsbank and private firms each owed about **2.5 billion gold marks in FX to external lenders**
- **Gold mark** = artificial unit used to measure value of paper mark to gold
- In 1914: one gold mark equaled one paper mark
- Debt of 5 billion gold marks = debt denominated in gold, with bill equal to amount of gold that could be purchased by 5 billion marks in 1914

### Hard Currency Debt Cannot Be Printed Away

> "Unlike local currency debt, hard currency (foreign currency and gold denominated) debt cannot be printed away."

- Debtors would have to get hands on either gold or foreign exchange to meet these liabilities
- While hard currency debt was <10% of total debt stock, it was still larger than entire public gold reserves of the Reich
- Hope: once Germany won war, mark would appreciate, making debt burdens more manageable
- And: **losing countries would be forced to pay for most of Germany's foreign and domestic debts**

### Policy Maker Warnings About Losing

- Policy makers recognized that if Germany lost war or failed to extract large reparations: **would be extremely difficult to pay back debts with hard money**
- According to **Rudolf Havenstein** (president of Reichsbank): covering those debts > "will be extraordinarily difficult if we do not get a large war indemnity"
- According to German economist **Edgar Jaffé**: unless England paid between 1/3 and 1/2 of Germany's war costs, result would be > "monstrous catastrophe" of "currency collapse" once German citizens learned domestic debts would likely be paid in depreciated money, and government agencies and private firms scrambled to get hands on foreign exchange to pay off external liabilities

### War's End: The Debt Trap

- Breaking peg to gold and monetizing ever-growing fiscal deficit, combined with wartime economic disruptions and shortages: led to declining exchange rate and pickup in inflation
- By beginning of 1918: mark had lost ~25% of value versus dollar and **prices had tripled**
- However, in context of WWI, this was pretty typical—i.e., what most countries did to fund their wars
- German inflation, while high, not significantly higher than other war participants

### Conditions for Inflationary Depression

- WWI (and accompanying monetization of debt) did NOT directly cause Germany's postwar inflationary depression
- As mentioned in archetype template: > "while inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies, they are most common in countries that:"

**Key vulnerability factors:**
- **Don't have a reserve currency:** No global bias to hold their currency/debt as store hold of wealth
- **Have low foreign exchange reserves:** Not much cushion to protect against capital outflows
- **Have a large stock of foreign debt:** Vulnerability to cost of debt rising via increases in either interest rates or value of currency the debtor has to deliver, or shortage of available credit denominated in that currency
- **Have a large and increasing budget and/or current account deficit:** Need to borrow or print money to fund the deficits
- **Have negative real interest rates:** Lenders not adequately compensated for holding the currency/debt
- **Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns in the currency:** Lack of trust in value of currency/debt

### Germany's Post-War Vulnerability

> "By the end of the war, the German economy met all of these conditions."

- Losing war meant mark was not going to be reserve currency of postwar era
- Large stock of external debts acquired
- Very likely Allies would force Germany to pay them additional sum in war reparations
- Foreign exchange reserves not sufficient to meet existing stock of external debts, let alone any additional reparation payments
- Real interest rates very negative, offered little compensation to creditors holding German currency/debt
- Budget and trade balance in very large deficits—Germany would remain dependent on borrowing/monetization to finance expenditures and consumption
- Finally: experience of high inflation, money printing, and negative total returns in holding mark had begun to reduce trust in German currency/debt as store hold of value

<!-- pp. 141-160 -->

## November 1918–March 1920: The Treaty of Versailles and the First Inflation

### Initial Capital Flight and Currency Collapse

- **German surrender (November 1918)** triggered massive capital flight as citizens rushed to convert wealth into foreign currencies and assets
- Mark declined ~30% vs dollar over next few months; stock market lost almost half its real value; government debt rose ~30%
- Money supply grew ~50%; inflation hit 30%
- Capital flight driven by uncertainty about peace terms and Germany's ability to pay massive liabilities with hard money

### Treaty of Versailles Shock

- Germans initially optimistic about lenient terms—hoped reparations would be limited to occupied territories, paid in goods, no annexations without referendum
- **Treaty reality (June 28, 1919)**: Germany lost 12% of territory, 10% of population, 43% of pig-iron capacity, 38% of steel capacity
- Required to compensate Allied citizens for all wealth seized during war, but received no compensation for its own assets confiscated abroad
- Had to honor all prewar debts to Allied creditors (even private citizens' debts)
- **Reparations**: Commission to determine final bill in 1921; interim payment of 20 billion marks in gold, commodities, ships, securities

### Currency Collapse Accelerates (July 1919–January 1920)

- Mark fell 90% vs dollar; inflation surged to 140% by year-end
- **Key mechanism**: Currency weakness driven primarily by capital flight, not money printing
- Citizens feared debt obligations would force extortionately high taxes and wealth confiscation to raise hard money
- As private wealth was at risk, getting out of the currency made rational sense

> "German citizens rushing to get their capital out of the country because they justifiably feared that these promises to deliver currency (i.e., these debt obligations) would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the German government to meet its liabilities with hard money."

### The Self-Reinforcing Spiral

- **German debtors with external liabilities** saw real expenses soar as mark fell—rushed to pay off foreign debts, flooding FX market
- This further weakened mark, triggering more capital flight
- **Classic dynamic** in countries with large foreign currency debt during balance of payments crises

> Hamburg industrialist: "We are driving ourselves to destruction if everyone now…secretly sells mark notes in order to be able to meet his obligations. If things keep on this way, the mark notes will become unusable."

### Critical Insight: Causality of Currency Weakness and Inflation

**Money printing was not the source of currency weakness—currency weakness was the cause of money printing.**

- Capital flight from currency/country drove currency down → drove higher inflation
- This is **how inflationary depressions happen**
- Central bank faced choice: allow liquidity/debt markets to tighten vs print money to fill void
- Central banks typically print to fill void → currencies decline

### Benefits of Currency Devaluation

**While currency declines hurt importers and those with foreign currency debts, devaluations are stimulative for the economy and asset markets:**

- Boost exports and profit margins (goods cheaper on international markets)
- Make imports more expensive (supports domestic industries)
- Assets rise in local currency value; attract capital from abroad (financial assets become cheaper in global terms)
- From July 1919–March 1920, mark decline and negative real rates boosted German economy, equity and commodity markets

### Economic Recovery Phase

- Export industry thrived; unemployment declined; business profitability improved; real wages remained low
- Hope that encouraging exports/discouraging imports would bring balance of payments into equilibrium

> German official: "I regard our gravely ailing currency as an admirable means of dispelling the hatred felt abroad towards Germany, and of overcoming the reluctance to trade with us by our enemies. The American who no longer gets for his dollar 4.21 marks worth of goods from us, but 6.20 marks worth, will rediscover his fondness for Germany."

### Erzberger Financial Reform (December 1919)

- Policy makers began addressing domestic debt burden and fiscal deficit
- **Finance minister Matthias Erzberger** proposed comprehensive tax-reform package
- Transfer wealth from "haves" to "have-nots" via highly progressive taxes: income (approaching 60%), wealth (65%)
- Increased Reich's income from direct taxes to 75% (1914: ~15%)
- Revenue sufficient to pay all government expenditures except reparations by 1922
- Previously, majority of revenue came from public enterprises (railroads), duties on exports/imports/coal

### Inflation as Alternative to "Confiscatory Taxation"

- Some officials advocated **currency weakness and inflation** as effective alternative to confiscatory taxation
- **Dr. Friedrich Bendixen** argued collecting monstrous sums through taxes would weaken productivity, reduce receipts, drive Reich to collapse
- "Only the transformation of war loans into money can bring salvation"
- Inflation would "cleanse" Germany of local currency war debts, allow new beginning
- Central bank officially rejected this, but recognized things might "develop along these lines anyway"
- By end of 1919, inflation had reduced domestic war-debt burden to ~25% of original 1918 value
- Wealthy scrambled to buy foreign currencies/real assets to prevent wealth being inflated/taken away

### Central Bank's Alternative: Deflationary Recession

**The classic dilemma: help creditors (long currency) vs debtors (short currency).**

- Central bank's alternative to allowing inflation to "naturally" reduce real debt: **tighten monetary policy and engineer deflationary recession**
- Would allow Reich to pay citizens closer to true value of loaned wealth, but crush domestic credit/demand, generate significant unemployment

**In economic crises, wealth redistribution from "haves" to "have-nots" more likely because:**
- Conditions of "have-nots" become intolerable
- There are more "have-nots" than "haves"

### Political and Social Context

- Unemployment still high, food shortages rampant, mass of returning soldiers needed jobs
- Clashes between capitalists and workers (typical in depressions) happening across Europe
- Communist revolution in Russia (1917); Communist ideas spreading
- **John Maynard Keynes**: "The inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse, because it is worse in an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier [i.e., the capitalist lender]."

### Late 1919/Early 1920 Progress

- By late 1919/early 1920, Germany had inflated away most domestic debt, passed comprehensive tax reform, beginning to see pickup in economic activity
- Good news on reparations: Allies invited Germany to submit own proposal; critics like **John Maynard Keynes** finding sympathy abroad
- Exchange rate began to stabilize

### Kapp Putsch (March 1921)

- **Wolfgang Kapp** led right-wing nationalist attempt to overthrow Weimar government and institute autocratic monarchist regime
- Collapsed within days after workers refused to cooperate and declared general strike
- Though complete failure, reminder of fragile political environment
- **Economic pain of deleveragings/depressions gives rise to populist and reactionary leaders on both Left and Right**

> Berlin businessman: "Just at the moment when we begin again to work more than before…when in London the recognition is mounting that through the imposition of the Versailles Treaty one has committed a fearful political stupidity, and that accordingly the exchange rate begins to improve, the military party…under the leadership of a man who is a notorious reactionary, again throws everything overboard and forces our workers into a general strike and demonstrations that are unnecessary because nothing will be achieved that way."

## March 1920 to May 1921: Relative Stabilization

### Stabilization Period Overview

- 14 months of **"relative stabilization"**: mark halted slide, prices remained stable, German economy outperformed developed world
- Germany wasn't collapsing from economic/political chaos as predicted
- Those shorting the mark lost considerable sums (notably **John Maynard Keynes**, who lost £13,000)

### Global Backdrop: Severe Contraction

- US and UK tightened monetary policy severely
- 1920-1921: US industrial production fell 20%, UK fell 18.6%; unemployment climbed to 22% (US) and 11.8% (UK)

### German Monetary Policy: Accommodative

- **Reichsbank kept discount rate at 5% until 1922** (contrast to other central banks)
- Regularly intervened to inject liquidity when credit tightened
- Spring 1921: when business liquidity tightened moderately, Reichsbank accelerated commercial bill purchases (from 3.1% to 9% of outstanding bills)
- Fiscal policy remained accommodative: real expenditures (ex-reparations) rising in 1920-1921
- Budget deficit remained huge (~10% of GDP), continued to be financed by floating debt issuance

### Stimulative Policies Enable Germany to Escape Global Contraction

- 1919-1921: industrial production increased 75%
- However, economic activity remained extremely depressed (industrial production and real GDP still well below 1913 levels)
- Considerable poverty and suffering in German society
- This period should be understood as **growth within a larger period of economic contraction**

### Inflation Dynamics: Domestic vs Global Forces

- Rising economic activity and reflationary policies did not produce much inflation (March 1920–May 1921)
- **Domestic inflationary pressures offset by global deflationary forces**
- Import prices from US/UK fell ~50%
- Rising capital flows into outperforming German economy helped stabilize currency, allowed slower money supply growth
- Mark rallied, inflation declined; by early 1921 prices stopped rising for first time since 1914

### Foreign Capital Inflows: The Speculative Bubble

- Germany became "hot economy" to invest in
- Foreigners willing to pour money in, financing ever-growing trade deficit
- Some commentators called it **"tremendous" speculative bubble**; **Keynes** called it "the greatest ever known"
- **Classic bubble sign: many flooding market were new buyers with no prior experience**

> Keynes: "[From those] in the streets of the capital…[to] barber's assistants in the remotest townships of Spain and South America…the argument has been the same…Germany is a great and strong country; someday she will recover; when that happens the mark will recover also, which will bring a very large profit."

### Scale of Inflows

- By 1921, almost a third of deposits in seven largest German banks were foreign-owned
- **Speculative inflows supported relative stabilization in mark**
- **Made central bank's job easier by reducing trade-offs between growth and inflation**

**Key insight from archetypal template**: When capital flows into a country, it tends to lower inflation rate and stimulate growth (all else equal); when capital leaves, it does the opposite—**making central bank's job much more difficult**

### Germany's Dependence on "Hot Money"

- German economy became increasingly dependent on **"hot money"** (speculative investments that could be pulled out at moment's notice)
- Hot money continued coming in year after year to finance fiscal and external deficits
- Classic bubble phase of balance of payments crisis: **increasing dependence on capital inflows to maintain spending/economic activity made recovery fragile, sensitive to any minor event that could trigger sentiment shift**

### Policy Maker Concerns: Currency Appreciation

- Mark's sharp appreciation in early 1920 was unwelcome for policy makers
- Falling mark considered essential to maintaining German export competitiveness, supporting employment growth, building hard currency earnings pool
- Considered "one good fortune in midst of misfortune" without which Germany would lose possibility of exports
- Initial appreciation hit exports hard; chamber of commerce said industry had practically "ground to a halt"
- Unemployment surged (trade union members unemployed tripling)

### Government Intervention to Depress Mark (March–June 1920)

- Economic ministry intervened to **deliberately depress mark** and stimulate employment
- **It worked**: mark fell, competitiveness returned, unemployment began to decline

### Policy Priority: Unemployment Over Inflation

- During this period, German policy makers more concerned about deflationary forces spreading to Germany than inflation from stimulative policies
- Rising unemployment and potential social unrest considered much more menacing than return of rising prices

> Reconstruction minister to industrialist: "[I] am not afraid of the inflation…if the crisis which has already broken out to its full extent in England were not to come over to us, we should allow the printing press to do a bit more work and begin rebuilding the country. This activity would enable us to build a dam against the crisis."

- Stabilization of mark, inflation, and economic conditions remained contingent on large speculative inflows and stable balance of payments

## May 1921: The London Ultimatum

### Reparations Ultimatum

- Arguments between Germany and Allies came to head with **"The London Ultimatum"** (May 1921)
- Allies threatened to occupy Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany didn't accept new reparation bill
- **Total reparations: 132 billion gold marks** (~330% of German GDP)
- 50 billion in quarterly installments, adding up to ~3 billion gold marks/year
- **Debt-service burden: ~10% of German GDP, 80% of export earnings**
- Remaining 70 billion would begin whenever Allied powers (not Germany) determined economy capable
- Germany faced huge hard currency debt burden + threat of debt service tripling at moment's notice

### Structure Creates Investor Anxiety

- Reparations demanded were enormous, dashed expectations of conciliatory agreement
- Payment structure deeply unnerving to potential investors and German public
- Debt service burdens would likely get bigger if economic conditions improved
- Chart shows size of hard currency debts imposed on Germany relative to other economies before major inflationary depressions
- **Weimar Germany dwarfs every other case**

### Immediate Market Reaction

- As soon as reparation burden announced, mark began selling off
- Declined 75% by end of year; inflation also returned, prices almost doubling over same period

> German participant at Versailles: "The world must be made to understand that it is impossible to burden a country with debts and at the same time to deprive it of the means of paying them…the most complete collapse of the currency…cannot…be avoided if the peace treaty is maintained in its current form."

### Balance of Payments Crisis

**The reparation schedule created a balance of payments crisis analogous to any payment problem faced by individuals/households/corporations.**

**To come up with money, a country must: 1) spend less, 2) earn more, 3) finance payments through borrowing/tapping savings, or 4) default (or convince creditors to give relief).**

- Unlike domestic war loans, Germany could not print away debt burden (debts not denominated in paper marks)
- Policy makers would need to rely on combination of four levers

### Why Cutting Spending Would Be Extremely Painful and Politically Dangerous

- ~50% of German government's total revenues would go to reparations
- Cuts in nonreparation expenses would need to be drastic to make a difference
- Most nonreparation spending went to essential social services: unemployment relief, subsidies for food/housing, funding for leading public employers (railways, shipyards)
- Large spending cuts considered **"politically impossible"**
- With Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, ongoing bloody civil war, growing Communist movement in Germany—policy makers feared potential revolution from left
- Simultaneously, increasingly humiliating Allied demands and economic pain fueling **far-right nationalism**
- Political chaos intensified: strikes, riots, acts of political violence increasingly common
- Summer 1920: state of emergency declared following widespread looting
- March 1921: Communist groups seized shipyards/factories, dispersed only after firefights with police
- October 1921: **finance minister Matthias Erzberger assassinated** by ultranationalists for role in 1918 surrender
- Government refused to cut social spending; Reichsbank refused to stop monetizing deficit

### Why Tax Burdens Were Already Extremely High

- Cutting spending untenable; so was raising income via additional taxes
- **Erzberger reforms of 1919** had already raised tax burdens considerably
- Increasing burden posed same political/social risks as cutting spending
- Additional tax increases would be immensely difficult to pass (Erzberger reforms had been watered down significantly by opposition in Reichstag)
- Would also likely accelerate capital flight

> Keynes on impossibility of meeting reparation burden through taxation: "the whips and scorpions of any government recorded in history [would not have been] potent enough to extract nearly half…[the required] income from a people so situated."

### Why Existing Savings Were Extremely Limited and Securing Lending Was Impossible

- Virtually no savings to draw on to service debts
- Treaty of Versailles had essentially seized/frozen all Germany's prewar foreign holdings and canceled all debts owed to Germans
- Those with foreign currency savings (primarily exporters) incentivized to keep earnings in foreign bank accounts (feared reparations burden would encourage government seizure of wealth)
- Central bank's gold reserves not enough to cover even first interest payment

### Limited International Credit Appetite

- Little appetite internationally to extend Germany credit on scale to spread out reparation burden
- **Two reasons**: 1) Most developed economies burdened by war debts of their own (owed to US), in midst of severe recessions; 2) German government (and most Germans) weren't creditworthy
- Head of Reichsbank approached Bank of England for 500 million gold mark short-term loan for second reparation installment—**"politely refused"**

> British Chancellor of Exchequer: "the difficulty was that there was a vicious circle. Germany said she could not stop the emission of paper money and repay her obligations unless she was able to raise a foreign loan, and she could not raise a foreign loan unless she could pay her obligations."

### Default Impossible

- Defaulting unilaterally impossible—Germany threatened with invasion
- Though leaders furiously and continuously tried to renegotiate payments, bitter feelings from war made victors (especially France) disinclined to make concessions

### The Currency Management Lever

**Unlike a household facing a payment problem, a country can change the amount of existing currency, and by doing so affect its value. This gives it an additional lever to manage a balance of payments crisis.**

- While Reichsbank could try to defend currency by raising rates and tightening credit (would increase returns on mark-denominated assets/deposits, attract more capital
<!-- pp. 161-180 -->

## Germany's Hyperinflation (continued)

### Policy Choices and the Path to Hyperinflation

**German policymakers faced impossible choices** — currency depreciation would crush domestic demand and close trade deficit but require "unimaginably severe contraction" intolerable to impoverished, conflict-ridden society. Only alternative: allow currency depreciation and print money to alleviate liquidity tightening from capital flight.

> **Key characteristic of hyperinflation**: "policy makers don't close the imbalance between income and spending/debt service; instead, they fund and keep funding spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money."

**Moderate money printing is helpful in deleveraging** — prevents severe economic contraction. **But excessive relational printing and severe currency devaluation (reflationary) relative to deflationary levers (austerity, debt restructuring/default) causes severe inflationary depressions.**

**Germany's mistake**: Extreme difficulty of using austerity, dissaving, external borrowing, and debt defaults as levers pushed policymakers to rely exclusively on money printing. They wagered inflation was "least terrible" option but failed to balance deflationary and inflationary forces.

### June 1921–December 1921: The Emerging Inflationary Spiral

**Classic inflationary spiral dynamics emerged** in H2 1921:
- **Germany's impossible foreign debt obligations** → currency decline → inflation + liquidity crisis
- **Central bank provided liquidity** by printing money and buying debt rather than allowing commerce to contract
- This triggered **further capital flight, inflation, tightening liquidity, more money printing** — spiral accelerated
- Central bank depleted substantial gold reserves for first reparation payments

**Reparations and capital flight** caused mark to decline 75% over period, inflation approached 100% per annum. Sharpest declines in October 1921 after **League of Nations ceded Upper Silesia** (major coal/industrial region) to Poland despite residents voting to remain in Germany.

**Rising inflation → surge in retail purchases** — not from economic activity but **"flight of income and savings into real goods before inflation could eat away purchasing power."** American Council of Hamburg noted "vast amount of retail buying"; *Hamburgische Correspondent* called it "monstrous lust for goods."

**"General liquidation"** — foreigners buying because mark was cheap, Germans buying to escape inflation → bare shelves. Berlin official shocked at "plundering of retailers by foreigners with highly valued currencies." British observer: shops closed 1-4pm, refused to sell more than one article per customer, "Germans laying in stores for fear of further price rise or total depletion of stocks."

**Massive increase in durable/real-asset purchases**: Auto sales at all-time highs, textile bookings months ahead, cotton firms refused new orders, industries at full capacity with overtime to meet demand. This was **"classic flight into inflation-hedge assets"** — not economic prosperity.

> Bavarian official: "The fall of the mark...has brought a real anxiety among the propertied classes. Everyone seeks to do something with their money. Everything is bought that can be bought, not only for present need, not only for future use, but in order to get rid of the paper and have objects to exchange when the time comes that it is worth absolutely nothing."

**Real interest rates became very unattractive**, real cost of borrowing plummeted → **surge in borrowing, which became extremely attractive.** Real investment reached prewar highs, monthly bankruptcy rates declined 75%. But investment was unproductive — firms pushed borrowed money into capital for "use value" not "intrinsic value." Firms keeping wealth in debt assets (bonds) suffered devastating losses. Called **"flight from the mark to the machine"** — resulted in excessive poorly-performing investments once inflation passed.

**Growing demand for real goods → increasing employment** in industries producing those goods → **unemployment fell, workers' bargaining power increased** → pushed for wage increases and better working hours. Summer 1921 standoffs led to large nominal wage gains, but these didn't keep up with inflation — **real incomes fell ~30%**, worsening tensions between "haves" and "have-nots."

**Only clear beneficiary: export sector.** Foreign sales increased as German goods became cheaper internationally. But pickup less than expected given large currency decline because: (1) considerable hostility to German exports abroad limited gains, (2) labor costs also declining globally from severe recession, limiting competitiveness gains from depreciating mark.

**Stock market speculation — "an orgy"** — stocks nearly tripled in value (inflation-adjusted) over period. August: Berlin exchange so overloaded it shut down 3x/week. By November: operating 1 day/week, banks refused share orders after 10am. Newspaper: "Today there is no one—from lift-boy, typist, and small landlord to the wealthy lady in high society—who does not speculate in industrial securities and study official quotations as most precious letter."

**This bull market was NOT driven by improving fundamentals or optimistic discounting** — it reflected **rush to get out of money or get short money (borrow it) against long "stuff" position.**

> Observer: "Stock market speculation today is the organized flight from the mark...at a time when the return on an investment diminishes in the same ratio as the value of the paper mark and when therefore even the solid capitalist, if he does not want to impoverish himself from day to day, must acquire real values. This alone has led to an extraordinary increase in the stock market business."

By end 1921: deteriorating conditions, loss of faith in mark, rapidly rising prices threatened economic/political collapse. Inflation nearing 100%. **Only thing preventing total collapse: foreigners' willingness to continue buying marks and fund Germany's massive external deficit** (~10% GDP). Despite loss of confidence at home, foreigners kept purchasing German assets at cheap prices.

### January 1922–May 1922: Negotiating a Reparation Moratorium

**Allied powers concluded German economy needed relief from reparation payments** — alarmed by chaos. Reparation debt burden was most crushing and inescapable. Continuing status quo risked total economic collapse → worsen political chaos → make future reparation collection impossible. But considerable disagreement among Allies on extent of relief and what Germany should give in return.

**Classic debtor/creditor standoff during deleveragings**: Debtors (Germans) demanded maximum relief; creditors (Allied powers) tried to extract maximum money without plunging debtor into insolvency. **Game of power brinksmanship played by all.**

> **J.P. Morgan Jr.** reportedly told confidant: "The Allies must make up their minds as to whether they wanted a weak Germany who could not pay, or a strong Germany who could pay. If they wanted a weak Germany they must keep her economically weak; but if they wanted her to be able to pay they must allow Germany to exist in a condition of cheerfulness, which would lead to successful business. This meant, however, that you would get a strong Germany, and a Germany that was strong economically would, in a sense, be strong from a military point of view also."

**Cannes Conference (January 1922)**: Temporary compromise reached. Reparations Commission reduced debt service bill 75% for remainder of year, provided Germany:
- Raised new taxes (including forced loan of 1 billion gold marks on wealthy citizens)
- Reduced spending and money printing
- Granted **Reichsbank formal independence** from government

**Concessions were mostly symbolic.** Taxes too small to meaningfully close budget deficit. **Reichsbank president Rudolf Havenstein** welcomed independence — said it would allow him to print as much money as needed for liquidity without fiscal policy constraints.

**Renewed optimism about reparation relief halted mark's slide.** By end January: mark risen 30% from 1921 lows, inflation (while high at ~140% per annum) stopped accelerating. **Inflationary spiral halted temporarily**, providing relief to German economy.

German policymakers pressed Allies for additional concessions, arguing **balance of payments, not central bank money printing, was ultimately responsible for inflationary crisis.**

> **Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau** (March 29, 1923 speech to Reichstag): "Over and over again we encounter the notion that if the value of our money has been ruined this can only be because we have printed money. The recipe which we are given against this is: stop your printing press, bring your budget in order, and the misfortune is ended. A grave economic error!...[How is it possible] to make continuous gold payments without the help of foreign loans and at the same time keep the exchange rate intact? The attempt has never been made to give such a prescription and it cannot be given. For a country that does not produce gold cannot pay in gold unless it buys this gold with export surpluses [which Germany did not have] or unless it is borrowed [which Germany could not do]."

**Mechanics of economics and markets were simple and basically same then as now.** While central bank could easily extinguish domestic currency denominated debt (via previously described methods), it could not easily extinguish external debts.

**February–May: currency expectations driven primarily by reparation negotiation news.** Good news (comprehensive agreement) → mark rallied, inflation expectations fell. Bad news (agreement less likely) → mark fell, inflation expectations rose. **Mark experienced numerous 10-20% swings** on sentiment changes. By end May: mark down ~40% vs. dollar as reparation agreement prospects deteriorated.

Chart shows **major mark swings from reparation negotiation updates** — markets "chopped up and down in big moves every time there was essentially any update."

### June 1922–December 1922: Hyperinflation Begins

**June 1922: expectations of reparation settlement collapsed** due to three interconnected events:

1. **French declared they would no longer accept reparations commission conclusions** on Germany's capacity to pay. France would make own determinations, seize German assets (particularly **coal mines in Ruhr**) if Germany defaulted. Instead of possible moratorium, Germany faced paying France whatever French demanded or risk sustained occupation of most valuable territory.

2. **International committee headed by JP Morgan Jr.** investigating gold loan to Germany to rebuild economy and ease external debt burden — contingent on reparation moratorium progress. Following French declaration, **loan committee forced to conclude extending credit impossible.**

3. **June 24: Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau assassinated** by right-wing group. Rathenau, despite belligerent speeches, was one of few German politicians trusted by Allied powers and enjoyed significant domestic support. If anyone could mediate settlement with Reparations Commission and get it through Reichstag, it was Rathenau. Assassination illustrated **threat of nationalism and extremist populism** hanging over Germany.

**Foreigners now rushed to pull capital from Germany.** Previously, ~1/3 of all German bank deposits were foreign-owned, foreign speculation had been huge source of support for economy and balance of payments. **Over next few months, ~2/3 of these deposits disappeared**, capital inflows collapsed. Simultaneously, German capital flight accelerated — wealthy citizens rushed to get wealth out before confiscatory January compromise taxes took effect. **Mark collapsed, hyperinflation began.**

**Acute liquidity crisis in German banking system → runs on banks.** Central bank printing no longer fast enough to keep up with mark flight abroad and rising prices. By July: **banks forced onto 3-day work weeks**, had to inform depositors they lacked enough cash to honor deposits or make weekly wage payments for large business clients. Some banks began printing own marks (illegal).

**The liquidity crisis was self-reinforcing. Depositors, seeing banks struggling to honor liabilities, began withdrawing deposits in ever-growing numbers, which only made liquidity crisis worse.**

By August 1922: economy on brink of financial collapse. **Central bank forced to respond by rapidly accelerating pace at which it printed marks and monetized growing share of government debt.**

Charts show:
- Marks in circulation (billions) and % of Treasury Bills held by Reichsbank both skyrocketing in 1922
- Central bank purchases of commercial bills and credit to loan bureaus both surging exponentially

**Central bank began purchasing commercial bills en masse.** As liquidity crisis deepened in fall, additionally accelerated provision of direct credits to banking system. By year end: Reichsbank holding ~1/3 of all commercial bills in circulation, increased credits to banking system by 1,900%. Such interventions **prevented financial system collapse**, led to ten-fold increase in money supply.

**Unlike past bouts** where inflation picked up substantially but never entered hyperinflation, **this round sent inflation skyrocketing.** Partly due to scale of liquidity injection needed to offset foreign capital pullback, partly due to **changing inflationary psychology** — most people had believed inflation semi-managed, now believed it out of control.

Charts show mark exchange rate vs USD and inflation (Y/Y) both going exponential in late 1922.

**In inflationary depressions, classic pattern: with each round of printing, more money leaves currency instead of going into economic activity.** Domestic currency holders see that investors shorting cash (borrowing in weakening currency) and buying real/foreign assets repeatedly do better than those who save and invest at home → increasingly catch on and shift from investing printed money in productive assets to purchasing real assets (gold) and foreign currency. **Foreign investors no longer return because repeatedly burned.**

**By August, with prices rising 50%+ per month and accelerating, policymakers recognized approaching hyperinflationary spiral** but felt no alternative but to continue printing. Why didn't they stop?

**Once inflationary depression reaches hyperinflationary stage, extremely difficult to stop printing. When extreme capital flight and extreme inflation feed off one another, money becomes harder to come by even as it loses worth.**

> **Keynes** visiting Hamburg (summer 1922, early hyperinflation phase): "The prices in the shops change every hour. No one knows what this week's wages will buy at the end of the week. The mark is at the same time valueless and scarce. On the one hand, the shops do not want to receive marks, and some of them are unwilling to sell at any price at all. On the other hand...the banks were so short of ready cash that the Reichsbank advised them to cash no checks for more than 10,000 marks...and some of the biggest institutions were unable to cash their customers' checks for payment of weekly wages."

**To stop printing would result in extreme shortage of cash and bring about total collapse of financial system and all commerce.** Economist at time: "[To stop the printing press] would mean that in a very short time the entire public, and above all the Reich, could no longer pay merchants, employees, or workers. In a few weeks, besides the printing of notes, factories, mines, railways and post office, national and local government, in short, all national and economic life would be stopped."

**People tend to think hyperinflations caused by central banks recklessly printing too much money, and all they need to do to stop it is turn off printing press.** If that easy, hyperinflations would almost never occur! Instead, **inflation spirals push policymakers into circumstances where printing is least bad of several terrible options.**

For Weimar Germany, cost of not printing was not only potential economic collapse but **political fragmentation.** France's repeated threats to occupy German territory if reparations unpaid made halting printing an invitation to foreign invasion. Also lowered hopes for productive reparations negotiations. Prominent industrialist: "The Reichsbank can no more stop inflation than the Burgermeister of Hamburg can tell the patients in the hospital to stop being ill...as long as it is possible for the French to invade Germany, there can be no talk of a stabilization of our currency."

**By September, Germany trapped in classic hyperinflationary spiral. Extreme capital withdrawals and rapidly rising prices forcing central bank to choose between extreme illiquidity and printing money at accelerating rate. Doing former would result in total collapse in business activity, so really no choice. However, as money supply grew, no one wanted to hold it in such depreciating environment. Velocity of money accelerated, triggering even more capital flight, money printing, and inflation, and so on and so forth.**

Chart relationship (shown logarithmically due to exponential growth): **currency weakness was leading inflation, which was leading money supply growth — not the other way around.**

**Reckless money printing was less the cause of hyperinflation than what was required to prevent massive deflationary defaults by banks (and just about everyone else) and deflationary economic collapse.**

### Currency's Dual Functions Break Down

**Money and credit serve two purposes: medium of exchange and store hold of wealth. As spiral accelerated, mark completely lost status as store hold of value.** People rushed to exchange it for any available alternative — real goods, foreign exchange, capital equipment.

**Very soon, exponential inflation rates made it impractical to trade in marks, so currency also began to lose status as means of exchange.** Foreign currencies (especially dollar) and even makeshift currencies became increasingly common in day-to-day transactions and price quotations. For instance, local Reichsbank branches found they didn't have enough actual paper notes for businesses to meet payroll obligations. So **central bank and finance ministry allowed some large depositors to print their own currencies** — called **Notgeld** ("emergency money"). Soon everyone began considering whether mark would go extinct.

> *Frankfurter Zeitung* (October 1922): "German economic life is...dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark; is it to remain the German currency, or is it doomed to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of account in domestic transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars, especially, has established itself, not only in firms' internal accounting practice, but above all as the method of price quotation in trade, industry and agriculture."

**October 12, 1922: government attempted to stop ever-growing flight into foreign currency** by putting restrictions on German citizens purchasing foreign FX. **Such capital controls are classic lever to control inflationary depressions; they are rarely successful.** Reasons: (a) capital controls have limited effectiveness at best because usually easy to get around, (b) **trying to trap people typically leads them to want to escape even more.** Not being able to get money out of country triggers psychology analogous to inability to get money out of bank: produces fear that produces run.

**Stock market was one of few remaining domestic escapes from inflation.** After declining 50% (real terms) since June, stocks rallied in H2 October — but like fall 1921, rally had nothing to do with underlying conditions or future economic prospects. In fact, fall 1922 real profit margins collapsing as hyperinflation chaos hit productivity. **Rally was extremely small in context of overall real stock market decline during debt crisis.**

Charts show: real equity prices and food as % household expenditure both rising sharply through 1922.

### January 1923–August 1923: The Occupation of the Ruhr and the Final Days of Inflation

**January 1923**: Economy already in chaos, prompted by Germany missing promised timber delivery as reparation payment, **French-Belgian force invaded Germany and occupied the Ruhr** (Germany's primary industrial region). French hoped this would pressure Germany to pay reparations more cooperatively and allow France to extract payments in coal.

**Germans responded by declaring "passive resistance."** Miners in Ruhr would strike to make occupation as costly as possible for French government. However, **resistance needed to be subsidized by Reich** — both miners and employers had to be paid. Also meant ~half country's coal supply needed to be imported, adding additional strain on balance of payments. Result: government spending increased, balance of payments deteriorated, liquidity shortages pushed Reichsbank to print even more, and **inflation (already at astronomical levels) accelerated even more.**

**France's aggression left opening for Germany in reparation negotiations** — occupation of country approaching economic ruin was widely denounced. To buy time, **Reichsbank began issuing dollar-denominated debt** (at considerable discount to international prices due to credit risk) to buy marks — central bank targeting peg against dollar. Between January-June 1923, Reichsbank

## Late 1923 to 1924: Ending the Hyperinflation

### The Failed FX Intervention (Early 1923)

- Central bank sold 400 million gold marks of borrowed FX and reserves to defend the mark's peg against the dollar
- Raised rates to 18% (symbolic given inflation ran near 10,000%)
- **Reichsbank president**: Intervention aimed not at permanent stabilization (impossible without reparations solution) but to "recover for the German economy...as long as possible...a time of somewhat calm...to free the market from wild and unscrupulous speculation"
- FX intervention briefly halted the slide—mark appreciated 50% for three months, introducing brief deflation that hurt shorts
- **By May, became clear Reichsbank lacked reserves** to pay dollar-denominated principal/interest and maintain the peg
- Fixed exchange rate policy abandoned six months after implementation
- Hyperinflation returned stronger: **36 trillion percent by November 1923**

### Hyperinflation's Devastating Scale (July 1922 - November 1923)

- Mark depreciated **99.99999997%** vs. dollar (cost of dollars increased 1,570 billion percent)
- Prices rose **387 billion percent**
- In 1913, six billion marks circulated in whole German economy; by late October 1923, entire 1913 money stock would buy **one kilo-loaf of rye bread**
- Living through this chaos was "immensely painful and traumatizing" for German citizens
- Experience later validated many Nazi criticisms of the "disastrous" Weimar era

### Crisis Conditions by Late 1923

- Unemployment rising rapidly
- Inflation well above 1,000,000%
- Real tax revenues diminishing at alarming rate
- Food growing scarce
- Transacting with marks nearly impossible—economic machine ground to a halt
- One local mayor: "I have never encountered such hordes of people starving and wandering about"
- **Rudolf Wissell** (future labor minister): "The inflation in which we find ourselves at this time is murdering the Republic. It will be the gravedigger of our Republic"

### Allied Intervention and Reparations Relief

- Allied powers concluded that without substantial reparation relief, German policy makers remained helpless to avert total economic collapse
- **November 1923**: Suspended reparations payments, reopened negotiations on restructuring the debt
- Gave German policy makers necessary breathing room

### Five Crucial Stabilization Steps

German policy makers took five logically sequential steps:

**1. Renegotiating Reparations Debt**
- Eventually reduced debt service burdens to just **1% of GDP**
- Made crippling reparation burden manageable

**2. Introducing New Currency (Rentenmark)**
- Backed by gold-denominated assets and land, pegged to the dollar
- Could fail if investors believed it would be used to monetize debt payments

**3. Strict Limits on Money Printing**
- Capped amount of rentenmarks that could be printed and debt that could be monetized
- Central bank can only credibly avoid monetizing debt if government can pay its bills

**4. Raising Revenue, Cutting Expenditures**
- Government raised revenues and cut expenditures with deep, extremely painful cuts
- Central bank capped loans to businesses and raised borrowing rates
- Built faith in new currency

**5. Building Foreign Exchange Reserves**
- Borrowing FX from Allies
- Encouraging German citizens who fled currency during hyperinflation to repatriate savings

> Earlier one-off measures (short-lived currency peg, capital controls) hadn't been enough—Germany needed comprehensive and aggressive policy shift that abolished the currency, accepted hard backing, placed extreme limits on monetization, credit creation, and government spending.

### 1) Restructuring the Reparations Debt

- Without reparation relief, structural drivers of inflation would have remained intact—unlikely any new currency could command faith as store of wealth
- **September 1923**: German industrialists in Ruhr began cooperating with Weimar government in negotiations with French
- Industrial magnates had long resisted concessions but recognized need for diplomacy as conditions deteriorated and workers rioted
- Agreed to resume coal transfers
- By mid-October, Weimar government ended financial support of "passive resistance" to Ruhr occupation—eliminating one of largest expenses
- **End of November**: British and French created **Dawes committee** to review and reduce Germany's reparations obligations
- Committee suspended reparations payments until final conclusions—made it easier for Germany to balance budget during stabilization
- **For 10 months**, Germany made no hard currency payments to reparations commission

### The Dawes Plan (August 1924)

- Significantly and permanently eased Germany's reparations burden
- Payments rescheduled, debt service costs reduced
- **Reparations payments = only 1% of German GNP in 1924-1925**—reduction of over 90% vs. 1923
- Germany still owed full 130 billion gold marks, but payments so spread out it was possible to meet them
- **Comparison chart** shows dramatic reduction:
  - Potential Debt Service (1921-1923): ~33% GDP if Allies demanded full payment
  - London Schedule Payments (1921-1923): ~18% GDP (suspended until Germany capable)
  - Typical Inflationary Depression: ~13% GDP
  - **Dawes Plan (1925): ~1% GDP**

### Debt Burden Relief Through Inflation

- With reparations debt service substantially reduced and domestic debt mostly inflated away, **Germany's debt burden largely relieved**
- Charts show dramatic decline in total government debt from peak during hyperinflation (300%+ GDP) to much lower levels after debt service suspended

### 2) Creating a New Currency

**Creating a new currency with very hard backing** is classic path for countries ending inflationary deleveragings.

### Three Stages of Currency Replacement (August 1923 - October 1924)

**Stage 1: Disorganized Emergency Measures (Summer 1923)**
- Transacting in mark became so difficult major institutions turned to alternatives
- Many used **foreign exchange** in place of domestic currency
- From late 1922 onward, major industries set prices in foreign currencies
- By 1923, much wholesale trade conducted directly in dollars, francs, or florins
- Those without FX access turned to **"emergency money"**—issued by local governments, trade associations, or companies, backed by real assets
- Emergency money illegal but easier to use than paper mark
- By fall 1923, **nearly 2,000 types** actively circulating in Germany

**Stage 2: Gold Loan Bills (August 1923)**
- Government issued very small-denomination debt indexed to dollars as temporary currency
- "Gold Loan" bills could be circulated directly or used as backing for other emergency currencies
- Backed only by stamp claiming "wertbestandig" (stable value) and promise government could "raise supplements to the tax on capital" to honor them
- **Public so desperate** for reliable store of wealth that gold loan bills retained value—in fact, tended to be hoarded rather than used, disappeared from circulation shortly after being issued

**Stage 3: The Rentenmark (October 15, 1923)**
- Government announced creation of **Rentenbank** and new stable-value currency, the **rentenmark** (circulation November 15)
- More ambitious scheme, an immediate "miraculous" success
- **Rentenmarks exchangeable** for either fixed quantity of paper marks OR fixed quantity of hard assets (vice versa)
- Hard backing applied not just to newly issued bills but **to all paper marks already in circulation**
- Rentenmark pegged to paper mark at ratio of **1 to 1 trillion**, and to dollar at **4.2 to 1**—symbolically significant exchange rate setting gold value equal to pre-war, peace-time mark
- Both pegged rates held in following months
- By December, both rentenmark and newly-pegged paper mark trading at par in foreign markets
- Inflation fallen to sustainable levels

### 3) Imposing Limits on Money Printing

- Key to new currency's success: Rentenbank issued relatively little and convincingly backed issues with real assets
- No large debts denominated in it—**total credit Rentenbank could extend capped at 2.4 billion marks**
- Rentenmarks directly secured by mortgages on **5% of all German agricultural and industrial property** ("renten" = annuities paid on mortgages)
- Even more important: **implicit security of Reichsbank's gold reserves**
- By 1923, real value of money supply so reduced by flight from paper marks it could be backed entirely by government's reserves
- Reichsbank cracked down on illegal emergency money, withdrew gold loan bills from circulation
- **Chart shows**: Monetary base in dollars had fallen to equal Germany's gold reserves by 1923

**Third Phase: The Reichsmark (October 11, 1924)**
- After year of relative stability, introduced another new hard currency: the **reichsmark**
- Purchased with rentenmarks at 1:1 ratio
- Unlike rentenmark (formally backed by mortgage bonds), reichsmark **exchangeable directly for bullion** at Reichsbank
- Could be converted into **same quantity of gold as pre-war mark**
- All remaining paper marks withdrawn by June 5, 1925
- Old currency (rentenmark) gradually phased out over next decade

> New currency crucial but not sufficient—took much more than rentenmark and reichsmark to create lasting stabilization. **Currency depends on credibility of institutions issuing it.** Not many promises to deliver currency (i.e., not much debt denominated in new currencies) meant central bank not forced to choose between inflationary monetization or deflationary defaults. Limited amount of currency meant it could be kept stable. Rentenbank succeeded because fundamentals were solid.

### 4) Ending Monetization

**In order to build confidence in new currency, countries in inflationary deleveragings need to stop monetizing debt.** As long as government can force central bank to print to cover liabilities, risk that new currency will be debased and supposedly hard backing abandoned. **Important that central banks be independent of political system.**

**Two Major Announcements**:
- **August 18, 1923** (private): Reichsbank informed Weimar government that beginning 1924, **would not discount any additional government debt**—memo quickly circulated among industrial elite, spurred policy makers to reconsider need for fiscal reforms
- **October 15, 1923** (public): Central bank officials stated new Rentenbank would **cap total government credits at 1.2 billion rentenmarks** and forbid Reichsbank from monetizing any government debt after November 15

**Testing Central Bank Independence**:
- Public and government initially doubted central bank would honor promises
- Rentenbank lent government entirety of 1.2 billion allocation almost immediately
- By December 1923, government requested additional 400 million rentenmarks
- **When Rentenbank officials stood firm**, successfully signaled beginning of new era of central bank independence and end of unchecked monetization

### 5) Closing the Deficit

**When central bank stops monetizing debts, government must either find new creditors, close deficits, or take control over central bank and continue monetizing debt. Since finding new creditors usually impossible in inflationary deleveraging, and monetizing debt only postpones the problem, budget ultimately needs to be balanced.**

- By late 1923, Weimar regime concluded it needed to close deficits—no choice, and with debts largely relieved, now possible
- **German finance minister**: "If we do not succeed in cutting loose from the inflationary economy through ruthless choking off of Reich expenditures, then the only prospect we have is general chaos"

**Fiscal Measures (August - October 1923)**:
- Government ran budget deficits since outbreak of war in 1914
- Took steps to address problem: indexed certain taxes to inflation, passed additional emergency taxes
- By October, indexed all taxes to inflation

**Spending Cuts**:
- Took aggressive measures to reduce expenses
- Dismissed **25% of employees**, cut salaries of remainder by **30%**
- Ended expensive subsidies to workers in "passive resistance" in Ruhr
- Such austerity extremely painful—would have been almost impossible year or two before
- By end of 1923, **German public willing to do almost anything** to bring prices back under control

**Virtuous Cycle of Stabilization**:
- More gradual inflation and stable exchange rate increased yield of existing taxes
- Stabilization increased real tax receipts, helping reduce budget strains and increasing public confidence in government's ability to avoid future monetization
- Following introduction of rentenmark in November, **real tax receipts increased rapidly**: from ~15 million gold marks in October 1923 to **over 300 million in December 1923**
- **By January 1924, government running a surplus**

### 6) Tightening Credit

- Officials tightened access to credit so private credit wouldn't add to inflationary pressures

**Two Channels**:
1. **February 1924**: Government "revalued" some privately held debts (required debtors to give creditors more than face value)—included mortgages, bank deposits, industrial debentures whose values fallen to almost nothing during hyperinflation. Implemented to appease angry creditors, also worked as tightening. Just as debt reductions ease credit/weaken currency/increase inflation, **debt revaluations tighten credit, support currencies, lower inflation**

2. **April 7, 1924** (more significant): Reichsbank **capped total credit** it would extend to private sector—wouldn't call back existing debt, but would extend new credit only as prior debts paid off. Strict cap painful for businesses short term, but also meaningfully stabilized German inflation, which **turned slightly negative in May 1924**

### 7) Accumulating Foreign Exchange Reserves

- Though all programs/policies/agreements put German economy on firmer footing, not everyone convinced they would ensure permanent stabilization
- Between November 1923 and October 1924, speculators continually bet against the mark
- As long as Germany lacked meaningful FX reserve, **speculative attacks remained threat** to continued stability

**Two Major Shifts Restored FX Reserves**:

1. **Transfer of privately held foreign currencies to Reichsbank**: As institutions/individuals gained confidence in rentenmark, began converting foreign currency they'd hoarded during hyperinflation into new bills. Between November 1923 and January 1924 alone, FX holdings at Reichsbank grew from ~20 million gold marks to **nearly 300 million**. These flows paused as inflation rose in early 1924 (individuals began accumulating foreign currencies again), but resumed once credit standards tightened and inflation stabilized

2. **Dawes Plan foreign exchange loan**: In addition to reducing reparations, Dawes Committee extended Germany significant FX loan. Issued October 1924, amounted to **800 million gold marks** worth of foreign currency, divided mainly between dollars, pounds, francs. Though not extraordinarily large, **meaningfully improved Reichsbank's credibility** when defending against speculative attacks, sent reassuring signal to foreign investors. In four years following Dawes Plan implementation, American investors poured money into German debt, attracted by relatively high yields

### Conclusion and Aftermath

- By 1924, crisis largely over
- Germany entered brief recovery period before Great Depression hit hard a decade later
- Second crisis economically devastating, fueled rise of right wing and left wing populists, **Hitler's rise to power**, and all that followed

## US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)

### Introduction

- **Great Depression** as iconic deflationary deleveraging, comparable to 2008 dynamics
- Study combines archival research with template analysis from "Archetypal Big Debt Cycle"
- Includes real-time "newsfeed" from newspaper headlines and Federal Reserve statements

### 1927–1929: The Bubble

#### Post-WWI Economic Boom

- After 1920-1921 recession, US experienced rapid technology-led growth
- **Electrification** of rural America opened massive markets for new technologies
- Radio ownership exploded: 60,000 sets (1922) → 7.5 million (1928)
- **Automobile industry** boomed: 23 million cars by 1929 (one per five Americans, 3x higher than 1920)
- Factory worker productivity increased 75% from 1922 to 1928
- Technology breakthroughs drove widespread economic optimism

#### The "Fat Years" (1922-1927)

- Period known as "fat years" — capitalists and workers both gained significantly
- Corporate profits hit postwar highs, unemployment dropped to postwar lows, real wages rose 20%+
- **In pre-bubble years 1923-1926, debt growth aligned with income growth** because it financed productive activities
- Stock market soared 150% (1922-1927) with little volatility
- **Radio Corporation of America** and **General Motors** led tech stock gains

#### Bubble Formation

- Bubble rooted in **dizzying productivity gains** and leveraged bets on their continuation
- **"New Era" belief**: permanent prosperity, end of boom-bust cycles, continuously rising stock prices
- US extremely attractive to foreign investment due to **gold standard**
- Gold flowed into US as foreigners bought dollars (to invest), determining events pre-crash

#### Federal Reserve's Policy Mistake

- Foreign nations (France, Germany, UK) worried about gold outflows, asked Fed to lower dollar interest rates
- Spring 1927: Fed cut discount rate from 4% to 3.5% to make dollars less attractive
- **Knock-on effect: encouraged US credit creation** — typical way central banks inadvertently finance bubbles
- Economy accelerated; H2 1928: industrial production +9.9%, auto production hit all-time high
- *Wall Street Journal* (early 1929): "One cannot recall when a new year was ushered in with business conditions sounder than they are today"

#### Classic Bubble Characteristics

1. **Prices high relative to traditional measures**
2. **Prices discounting future rapid appreciation from high levels**
3. **Broad bullish sentiment**
4. **High leverage financing purchases**
5. **Extended forward purchases** (inventory, contracts) to speculate/protect against price gains
6. **New buyers** entering market
7. **Stimulative monetary policy inflates bubble; tight policy pops it**

#### Extreme Valuations and Sentiment

- After prices nearly doubled (1927-1928), stocks sold at **extremely high multiples financed by borrowing (margin)**
- Some stocks valued at 30x earnings
- **Charles Amos Dice** (*New Levels in the Stock Market*, 1929): broader investor base made high valuations permanent
- Dice proclaimed obsolete the truism "what goes up must come down"

#### New Buyers Flood the Market

- **Unsophisticated investors with no prior stock experience** entered — classic bubble sign
- Brokerage branch offices outside Wall Street increased 50%+ (1928-1929)
- Broker quote (1929): "Wherever one went, one met people who told of their stock-market winnings. At dinner tables, at bridge, on golf links, on trolley cars, in country post offices, in barber shops, in factories and shops of all kinds"

#### Leverage Outside Banking System

- **High and rapidly increasing leverage**, especially **outside regulated banking**
- **New/fast-growing lending markets with heavy leverage are symptomatic of bubbles**
- Banks made new assets seem safe via guarantees or packaging — without crisis stress-testing, hard to know true safety
- **"Innovations" typically seed next crisis if unmonitored/unmanaged**
- **Bankers and speculators in symbiotic relationship**: bankers lent at fat spreads, speculators bought stocks on leverage, pushing prices up

#### Call Loans and Shadow Banking

- **Call loans** (relatively new): huge channel for margin debt, daily adjusting terms/rates, callable anytime
- **Created asset/liability mismatches**: short-term debt funding long-term risky assets, with risky borrowers paying higher rates
- **Classic debt crisis ingredient: squeezing lenders/borrowers with debt/liability mismatches from bubble**
- Non-Federal Reserve lenders (non-banks, foreigners) in call loan market: 24% (early 1928) → 58% (October 1929)
- Added risk: Fed couldn't lend to non-banks in a squeeze
- Foreign capital poured in from London and Hong Kong — historian: "A great river of gold began to converge on Wall Street, all of it to help Americans hold common stock on margin"

#### Investment Trusts

- **Investment trusts** saw rapid growth during bubble, drew new speculators
- First popularized in Great Britain; companies issuing shares and investing proceeds in other companies' shares
- **Irving Fisher** praised "wide and well-managed diversification" for capital-limited investors
- By 1929, new trusts launching at nearly 5 per week, capturing one-third of new capital raised
- **Trust promoters** claimed diversification made financial system safer
- **However**: many trusts used leverage to amplify returns, creating investor risk
- Speculators, unaware of security nature and believing past would continue, took margin loans to lever up already-levered trust shares

#### Self-Reinforcing Dynamics

- Rising prices attracted more buyers to lever up and profit
- **The more prices increased, the more aggressively speculators bet they would increase still more**
- **Higher prices encouraged stock supply increases** (more offerings)
- **Bubble phase paradox: as prices rose, credit standards lowered** (opposite of logical), because lending/buying stocks with borrowed money proved very profitable for both lenders and borrowers

#### Shadow Banking vs. Traditional Banks

- Leveraging mostly in "shadow banking"; traditional banks looked healthier than pre-1920-1921 recession
- Banks posting record earnings, higher capital ratios (17.2% vs. 14.9%), stickier liabilities (35.7% time deposits vs. 23.3%)
- Large bank mergers (1929) viewed as further strength
- **Classic pattern: bank earnings/balance sheets look healthy during good times because assets highly valued and deposits backing them are there. Problems emerge during runs when assets fall**

#### Federal Reserve's Dilemma

- Fed governors debated restraining stock speculation lending but hesitant to raise short-term rates
- Economy not overheating, inflation subdued, higher rates would hurt all borrowers (not just speculators)
- **Worst debt bubbles not accompanied by high/rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth**
- **Central banks accommodate debt growth focused on inflation/growth—not on debt growth, asset inflations, or whether debts will produce servicing incomes**

#### Macroprudential Measures

- Rather than raising discount rate, Fed enacted **macroprudential (regulatory) measures** to constrain bank credit supply
- Lowered acceptance rates for loans, increased supervision of credit facilities
- Fed publicly released letter to regional banks deriding "excessive amount of the country's credit absorbed in speculative security loans," threatening to refuse funding such loans
- **But these policies were largely ineffective**

### Late 1929: The Top and the Crash

#### Tightening Pops the Bubble

- 1928: Fed tightened monetary policy, raising rates 1.5% (February-July) to 5%
- Hoped to slow speculative credit without crippling economy
- August 1929: raised rates again to 6%
- **As short-term interest rates rose, yield curve flattened and inverted**
- **Liquidity declined; return on holding cash increased as yields rose**
- **Loans became costly; cash became attractive vs. longer duration/riskier financial assets**
- **Money moved out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value**
- **Declining asset prices created negative wealth effect**, feeding on itself in markets and economy through declining spending/incomes
- **The bubble reversed into a bust**

#### First Signs of Trouble (March 1929)

- News: Federal Reserve Board meeting daily (no released details) sparked Wall Street rumors of clampdown
- After two weeks of modest declines and unusual Saturday meeting report, stock market broke sharply March 25-26
- Dow fell 4%+, call loan rates hit 20% as panic gripped market
- Record trading volumes; wave of margin calls on leveraged investors forced selling, exacerbating decline
- **Charles Mitchell** (National City Bank president, also NY Fed director) announced bank ready to lend $25 million to market
- Calmed market, rates fell, stocks rebounded
- **Foreshadowed stock vulnerability to credit tightening**

#### Economy Remains Strong (Mid-1929)

- Growth moderated somewhat, but economy remained strong through mid-1929
- June *Federal Reserve Bulletin*: industrial production and factory employment at all-time highs through April; construction rebounded sharply after Q1 fall

#### Final Rally (May-August 1929)

- After short May sell-off, rally accelerated, bubble reached blow-off phase
- Stocks rose ~11% (June), 5% (July), 10% (August)
- Rally supported by accelerating leverage: household margin debt rose $1.2 billion over three months

#### Final Tightening

- Money continued tightening. August 8: Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised discount rate to 6%
- Clear that macroprudential measures failed to slow speculative lending
- Concerns about high stock prices/interest rates caused brokers to tighten call loan terms, raise margin requirements
- Margin requirements at most brokers: dropped to 10% previous year, rose to 45-50%

#### Market Peak (September 3, 1929)

- Stock market peaked September 3 when Dow closed at 381 — **wouldn't reach again for 25+ years**

#### No Single Event Caused Burst

- **No specific event/shock caused bubble burst**
- **Classic with bubbles: rising prices required leveraged buying to accelerate at unsustainable rate**
- Both speculators and lenders near/at max positions; tightening changed leveraging economics

#### Early Decline (September-Early October)

- Stocks declined September and early October as bad news eroded confidence
- September 5: **Roger Babson** speech to National Business Conference warned about collapse from "tight money" → 2.6% "Babson break"
- September 20: **Clarence Hatry's London financial empire** collapsed on fraud charges, forcing British investors to sell American holdings
- September 26: **Bank of England** raised discount rate from 5.5% to 8-year high of 6.5%; European nations followed
- By mid-October: 10% sell-off from highs
- Major papers' view: worst over, recent volatility good for market
- October 15: **Irving Fisher** proclaimed "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau"

#### The Stock Market Crashes

- Then the bottom fell out — day-by-day account follows via own description and newsfeed

**Saturday, October 19:**
- Stocks fell sharply; second-highest Saturday trading volume ever
- Decline self-reinforcing on downside
- Wave of margin calls after close required leveraged owners to add cash (hard to obtain) or sell stocks
- Sunday's *New York Times* headline: "Stocks driven down as wave of selling engulfs the market"
- Traders widely expected Monday recovery
- **Thomas Lamont** (J.P. Morgan) wrote President **Herbert Hoover**: "future appears brilliant"

**Monday, October 21:**
- Week began with heavier selling
- Analyst described waves of sell orders as "overwhelming and aggressive"
- Trading volume broke records; another wave of margin calls, distressed selling among levered players prevalent
- Markets rallied into Monday's session end, so losses smaller than Saturday

**Tuesday, October 22:**
- Small gains

**Wednesday, October 23:**
- Opened quietly, but hopes worst had passed shattered before close
- Avalanche of sell orders in last trading hour pushed stocks down sharply, triggering fresh margin calls and forced selling
- **Dow suffered then-largest one-day point loss in history**: fell 20.7 points (6.3%) to close at 305.3
- Because sell-off so sharp and late in day, unprecedented margin calls went out that night, requiring significant collateral to avoid Thursday position closures
- Many equity holders would be required to sell

## Black Thursday and Black Monday: The 1929 Crash

### Black Thursday (October 24, 1929)

- Exchange workers prepared for massive margin calls and sell orders; policemen posted throughout financial district
- **William R. Crawford** (NYSE Superintendent) described "electricity in the air so thick you could cut it" before the open
- After quiet opening, avalanche of selling materialized—sell orders poured in nationwide, pushing prices down and generating cascading margin calls
- Pace of selling so frantic that operators struggled to keep up; exchange telephone clerk: "I can't get any information. The whole place is falling apart"
- By noon of **Black Thursday**, major indices down more than 10 percent

### The Bankers' Pool Intervention

- Small group of biggest bankers met at **J.P. Morgan** offices, hatched stabilization plan
- **"The Bankers' Pool"** committed to buy $125 million in shares
- Traders acting for bankers placed large buy orders above recent prices—news spread, other investors bought aggressively
- Dow hit low of 272 (down 33), bounced back to close at 299, down only six points
- This would prove to be first of many failed attempts to bolster the market

### Black Monday (October 28, 1929)

- **President Hoover** and 35 brokers took out full-page ad in *New York Times* Friday, confidently telling public it was time to buy
- Hoover declared: "The fundamental business of the country, that is, production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous basis"
- Stocks steady through rest of week; Sunday papers showed optimism about cheapness supporting rebound
- But collapse resumed Monday—flood of sell orders from all investor types
- Significant selling came from brokers whose loans from corporations were suddenly called amid panic
- Trading volume set record: 9 million shares changed hands (3 million in last hour alone)
- Dow finished down 13.5 percent—largest one-day loss in history, became known as **Black Monday**
- Bankers' Pool met again after close, stirred optimism, but announced no additional buying measures

### Black Tuesday (October 29, 1929)

- Another massive wave of margin calls Monday night; $150 million of call loans pulled before Tuesday's open
- **Federal Reserve attempted to counter collapse in credit by providing liquidity**
- **George Harrison** (New York Fed president) announced before open: Fed would inject $100 million in liquidity to ease credit crunch by purchasing government securities
- Harrison made purchases outside regular Open Market Investment Committee account—didn't want to wait for Fed Board approval in Washington
- **Key insight: Classically the checks and balances designed to ensure stability during normal times are poorly suited for crisis scenarios where immediate, aggressive action is required. In the late 1920s, there were few well-established paths for dealing with the debt implosion and its domino effects.**

### Market Continues Falling

- Fed's liquidity eased credit conditions, likely prevented failures, but wasn't enough to stop stock collapse
- Starting at open, large blocks of shares flooded market, pushed prices down
- Rumor that Bankers' Pool shifted to selling fed the panic
- NYSE members met at noon to discuss closing exchange, decided against it
- Investment trusts hit especially hard—leverage that buoyed returns through bubble now worked in reverse
- **Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation** fell 42 percent; **Blue Ridge** down as much as 70 percent before recovering somewhat
- Dow closed down 11.7 percent, second worst one-day loss in history
- Market had fallen 23 percent over two days; problems with leveraged speculators and their lenders already emerging

### Wednesday Rally and Policy Response

- Stocks snapped back Wednesday, rising 12.3 percent in **one of the sharp bear market rallies that classically occur repeatedly during the depression phases of big debt crises**
- NYSE announced trading would begin at noon next day, exchange closed following Friday and Saturday to catch up on paperwork
- Both Fed and **Bank of England** cut rates Thursday
- Fed dropped bank rate from 6 percent to 5 percent; Bank of England decreased discount rate from 6.5 percent to 6 percent
- Traders cheered news that call loans outstanding had fallen by more than $1 billion from prior week
- Believing worst of forced selling had passed, markets rallied again

### Continued Volatility

- Speculators looking to capitalize on prior week's rally raced to sell when market opened Monday—stocks plunged again
- By Wednesday, Dow was down 15 percent on the week; stocks continued to fall following week as well
- **Railroad bonds and high-grade bonds performed well** during crash as investors sought safer investments after pulling back from stocks and call loans
- Yields between high-grade and lower-grade corporate bonds (rated BAA and below) reached widest level in 1929—riskier corporate bonds were flat to down
- Market action typical in this phase: equities and bonds with credit risk falling, Treasury and other low credit risk assets rising

### Economic Impact Begins

- Financial and psychological impacts of stock plunge began hurting economy
- Politicians and business leaders talked up economy's strength, but stats showed weakness
- Industrial production peaked July; freight car loading and steel utilization released week of November 4 showed ongoing declines
- Sharp drops in commodity markets added to worries
- By mid-November, Dow down almost 50 percent from September peak

## Policy Responses to the Crash

### Hoover Administration's Initial Response

- Hoover's early moves broadly praised, helped drive meaningful stock rally
- November 13: **President Hoover** proposed temporary one percent reduction in tax rate for each income bracket and increase to public construction spending of $175 million
- Two days later, invited "small preliminary conference of representatives of industry, agriculture and labor" to develop plan for fighting downturn
- When they convened following week, Hoover solicited pledges:
  - Business leaders: not cut spending on capital investment or wages
  - Labor union leaders: not strike or demand higher wages
- December 5: Hoover convened conference of 400 reputable businessmen, created leadership committee of 72 top business tycoons headed by **Chairman of US Chamber of Commerce**
- Mix of policies successful for a time, as was Hoover's support for Federal Reserve System's efforts to ease credit

### Federal Reserve Easing

- New York Fed aggressively provided liquidity during crash
- Within a month, cut discount rate from 6 percent to 5 percent, then again to 4½ percent
- These policy moves combined with private sector steps to support stock market, most notably **John D. Rockefeller's** bid for one million shares of **Standard Oil Co.** at $50 on November 13 (effectively flooring price at $50)
- On November 13, market bottomed and began 20 percent rally going into December—sense of optimism took hold

## 1930–1932: Depression

### Early 1930: Misplaced Optimism

- By New Year's Day 1930, widely believed stock market's 50 percent correction was over, helped drive strong rebound in first four months
- Stocks seemed cheap because there wasn't much evidence yet that company earnings would fall much
- Investors biased by memories of most recent downturns (1907 and 1920)—in both cases, worst was over after correction of about 50 percent
- Helping fuel optimism, policy makers continued taking steps to stimulate economy
- Fed cut rates to 3.5 percent in March, bringing total rate cuts to 2.5 percent in just five months (sparking debate within Fed over whether too much stimulation risked weakening dollar)
- March 25: Congress passed two appropriation bills for state road building and construction projects, bringing total fiscal stimulus to about 1 percent of GDP

### Consensus View: Recovery Expected

- Consensus among economists at **American Economic Association** and **Federal Reserve**: simulative policy moves would be enough to support economic rebound
- January 1, *New York Times* captured shifted sentiment: "Lack of widespread commercial failures, the absence of serious unemployment, and robust recovery in the stock market have been factors calculated to dispel the gloominess"
- Banks actually expanding investments through 1930; member banks' holdings of foreign, municipal, government, and railroad bonds all rose
- By April 10, Dow rallied back above 290

### Economy Weakens Despite Stimulus

- Despite stimulation and general optimism, economic weakness persisted
- First quarter earnings disappointing; stocks began sliding starting late April
- **Key insight: In the early stages of deleveragings, it's very common for investors and policy makers to underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren't enough.**
- Over second half of 1930, economy clearly began to weaken
- May through December: department store sales fell 8 percent, industrial production fell 17.6 percent
- Unemployment rose by over 10 percent (to 14 percent); capacity utilization fell by 12 percent (to 67 percent)
- Housing and mortgage debt collapsed
- Decline more akin to shallow recession at that point—consumer spending remained above lows of previous recessions, many industries not yet suffering severe declines

### Credit Spreads Widen

- As economy weakened, sell-off across markets resumed
- By October 1930, stock market fallen below lows reached in November 1929; commodities also fell sharply
- Market analysts and investors realizing hopes for quick recovery would not materialize; Hoover remained optimistic
- **Although Federal Reserve decreased interest rates and Treasury bond market was strong, spreads continued to widen. This increased the interest rates facing most consumers and businesses.**
- Rates rose on long-term mortgage loans; yields on municipal bonds (which performed well following crash) began to rise as credit anxieties developed
- Some industries hit particularly hard by worsening credit conditions
- **Railroads** had large amounts of debts they needed to roll, facing both tighter credit conditions and decreased earnings
- Because railroads considered vital industry, government wanted to support them, likely with bailout
- (Railroad industry's circumstances parallel struggles auto industry faced in 2008 financial crisis)

## Rising Protectionism

### Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

- **As is common in severe economic downturns, protectionist and anti-immigrant sentiment began to rise**
- Politicians blamed weakness on anti-competitive policies by other countries, posited higher tariffs would help reverse slump in manufacturing and agriculture, while restricting immigration would help economy deal with unemployment
- Protectionist sentiment resulted most notably in passage of **Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act**, which imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports
- Investors and economists feared proposed 20 percent increase in tariffs would trigger global trade war and cripple already weak global economy
- As act neared passage early May, 1,028 economists issued open letter to Hoover imploring him to veto the bill if it passed in Congress
- Foreign governments expressed opposition and hinted at retaliation
- Tariffs—particularly on agricultural imports—were one of Hoover's campaign promises, so he reluctant to renege even as pushback against Smoot-Hawley tariffs became more intense
- Stocks sold off sharply as it became clear tariff bill would pass
- After falling 5 percent previous week, Dow dropped another 7.9 percent on June 16, day before tariff bill passed
- While tariffs have sometimes increased during periods of economic downturn, Smoot-Hawley pushed tariffs to near-record levels

### Retaliatory Trade War

- Soon US faced wave of retaliatory protectionist policies
- Most impactful initial response came from US's largest trading partner, **Canada**, which at the time took in 20 percent of American exports
- Canadian policy makers increased tariffs on 16 US goods while simultaneously lowering tariffs on imports from British Empire
- As similar policies piled up in years that followed, they accelerated collapse in global trade caused by economic contraction

### Immigration Restrictions

- **Restricting immigration (both legal and illegal), another common protectionist response to economic weakness, was also pursued by the Hoover administration in 1930**
- September 9: Hoover put ban on immigration, allowing travel only for tourists, students, and working professionals
- Described policy as necessary to deal with unemployment
- Later reflected in memoir: "directly or indirectly all immigrants were a public charge at the moment—either they themselves went on relief as soon as they landed, or if they did get jobs, they forced others onto relief"

## Bank Failures Begin

### Banking System Under Stress

- Banks largely held up well following stock market crash, but as those they lent to were hurt by crash and economy weakened, they began to feel it
- In 1930, bank net earnings declined about 40 percent compared to prior year, but they remained on sound footing
- Several of largest banks even increased their dividends; they looked strong at time compared to markets and economy
- Many analysts believed they would be source of support through downturn
- Majority of early failures confined to banks in Midwest and country banks that had a lot of money in real estate loans, exposed to losses from drought
- While failures started small, they spread as credit problems spread

### Bank Runs Begin

- By December 1930, bank failures had become meaningful risk to broader economy
- Worries about banks led to runs on them
- **Runs on non-guaranteed financial institutions are classic in such depressions/deleveragings, and they can lead to their failure in a matter of days**
- 1930: 8,446 more commercial failures than in 1929, bank failures in 1930 than in 1929
- Liabilities of companies in default 1930 exceeded those in preceding year by $185,000,000
- Number of failures was 15 percent higher and indebtedness 38.3 percent greater

## The Gold Standard Constraint

### Gold Standard as Foreign Currency Debt

- Before discussing banking failures, important to discuss gold standard's role in determining how 1930s debt crisis transpired
- When debts denominated in prior sections described, deleveragings can generally be managed well
- **Being on a gold standard is akin to having debts denominated in a foreign currency** because creditors could demand payment in gold (as often written into contracts), and policy makers couldn't freely print money (too much printing would lead people to redeem their money for gold)
- **So policy makers were working with a limited toolkit until they broke the link to gold**

### Bank of the United States Failure

- Most important bank failure of this period: **Bank of the United States**, which had some 400,000 depositors, more than any bank in country at time
- Run on it began December 10 because of false rumor
- Wall Street financiers—including heads of **J.P. Morgan** and **Chase**—met at New York Fed to determine whether they should provide $30 million required to save bank
- Many within group thought bank was insolvent, not simply illiquid, so they should let it fail
- **New York Superintendent of Banks Joseph Broderick** argued its closing "would result in the closing of at least ten other banks in the city and … it might even affect the savings banks" (i.e., it was systemically important)
- Also noted he believed bank to be solvent
- Broderick's colleagues ultimately did not agree with him
- When bank closed its doors next day, it was biggest single bank failure in history
- *New York Times* would later refer to its failure as "The First Domino In the Depression"—certainly a turning point for public confidence in nation's banking system

### Federal Reserve Constraints Under Gold Standard

- Banks structurally vulnerable to runs because of liquidity mismatch between liabilities (short-term deposits) and assets (illiquid loans and securities)
- Even sound bank can fail if it can't sell its assets fast enough to meet liabilities
- **Because of the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was restricted in how much it could print money, limiting how much it could lend to a bank facing liquidity problems (i.e., act as a "lender of last resort"). There were also legal constraints. For instance, the Fed at the time was only allowed to give direct access to its credit to member banks, but only 35 percent of commercial banks were members. So banks would often have to borrow from the private sector and sell their assets in a "fire sale" to avoid failure.**

### Political Shift

- End of 1930 also saw political winds beginning to shift
- With downturn playing prominently in voters' minds, Democrats swept Congress in November mid-term elections
- This foreshadowed FDR's win in presidential election two years later

## First Quarter, 1931: Optimism Gives Way to Gloom as Economy Continues to Deteriorate

### Brief Optimism Early 1931

- At start of 1931, economists, politicians, and other experts in both US and Europe still retained hope there would be imminent return to normalcy
- Problems still seemed manageable; bank failures of previous quarter thought to be inconsequential, not damaging to overall financial system
- By March, all business indexes pointing to rise in employment, wages, and industrial production
- Bank runs led to less than 10 percent drop in deposits
- News reflected growing economic confidence: March 23, *New York Times* declared depression had bottomed, U.S. economy was on its way back up
- New investment trusts being formed to profit from expected "long recovery"

### Stock Market Rally

- Optimism bolstered by recovery of stock market
- Through end of February, Dow rose more than 20 percent off its December lows
- Optimism was also bolstered by recovery of stock market

### Rally Fades

- Rally wasn't sustained
- Growing concerns over Europe and indications of weak first quarter earnings caused stock prices to slip through March
- End quarter at 172.4, down 11.3 percent from their February highs

## The Growing Debate over Economic Policy

### Politics as Risk Factor in Depressions

- **In a depression, the main ways that politics might play a role are by standing in the way of the implementation of sensible economic policies or by leading to extreme policies. These are important risks that can make a depression worse.**

### Fiscal Policy Debate

- After more than a year of economic contraction, political debate over economic policy was intensifying
- By this time, more than six million people were unemployed in United States and there was no agreement among policy makers and business leaders on how to deal with it
- Understanding this debate is key to understanding why policy makers took certain steps that ultimately worsened the crisis
- Also helps illustrate many of the classic mistakes policy makers make when handling big debt crises

#### The Direct Relief vs. Indirect Relief Debate

- Fiscal policy debate centered on whether or not Federal government should significantly ramp up spending to support economy
- Senate Democrats, joined by some Republicans, pushed President to increase "direct relief" for those facing particularly difficult circumstances
- That would of course mean larger deficits and more debt, and it would mean changing rules of game to shift wealth from one set of players to others, rather than letting game play out in way that would provide good lessons to help prevent such problems in future (moral hazard perspective)
- Strong belief that if this money was just given away and not turned into productivity, it would be wasted
- While Hoover administration had supported earlier fiscal stimulus, it opposed significant direct relief from Federal government that would "bring an inevitable train of corruption and waste such as our nation had never witnessed"
- Hoover's administration instead advocated for "indirect relief"—mix of policies that included lobbying private sector to invest and keep employment steady, reliance on aid from state and local governments, immigration restrictions, and macroprudential policies to encourage lending

#### Budget Deficit Concerns

- While concerns over budget deficits limited stimulus spending, by 1931, federal government budget deficit grew to 3 percent of GDP
- Deficit was due to falling tax revenue (collapsed to nearly half of 1929 levels) and increase in social spending of about $1 billion approved previous year
- **Treasury Secretary Mellon** believed balancing budget was necessary first step to restore business confidence
- Hoover agreed for reasons he later summarized in memoir: "National stability required that we balance the budget"

#### The Austerity Trap

- **Worries over the deficit and a push for austerity are classic responses to the depression phase of a big debt crisis. Austerity seems like the obvious response, but the problem is that one person's spending is another person's income, so when spending is cut, incomes are also cut, with the result that it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in debt/income ratios.**

### Hoover's Approach Proves Insufficient

- For all suffering Depression had caused, sense of crisis-driven urgency hadn't yet developed
- Economy was still contracting over first half of 1931, but at slower rate than year before
- Hoover was certain that indirect relief was meeting needs of people and he did not see need to use additional fiscal supports
- As we'll discuss later, this ultimately tipped debate, and **the Hoover administration to make the classic rookie mistake of leaning too heavily on austerity and other deflationary levers** relative to more stimulative policies until pain of doing these things became intolerable

## Second Quarter, 1931: The Global Dollar Shortage Causes a Global Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar

### Dollar Squeeze Emerges

- Because dollar-denominated credit was collapsing and a lot of dollar-denominated debt that required dollar credit to service it existed around world, global dollar shortage emerged during first half of 1931
- **Classically, there is a squeeze in a reserve currency that is widely lent by foreign financial institutions when there is a collapse of credit creation in that currency**
- Although other currencies faced shortage amid credit crunch, dollar was particularly impacted because of its role as global funding currency
- At same time, falling US imports reduced foreigners' dollar income, intensifying squeeze
- Note that virtually same dollar squeeze dynamics occurred in 2008 crisis for same reasons

### Germany as Epicenter

- As financial markets and many other markets are global, one can't understand all that happened by looking only at US
- What happened in US had big impact on what happened in Germany, which led to big political changes that were felt around world in 1930s and early 1940s
- In 1931 Germany was epicenter of emerging dollar squeeze
- Had previously faced great difficulty paying back reparation debt it owed and had been forced to borrow as result
- Country had become popular destination for "carry trade," in which investors would lend their dollars to Germany to earn higher yield than they would get in dollars and Germans would borrow in dollars to get lower interest rate
- Once again, this type of behavior is classic in "good times," when there is little perceived risk and large cross-country credit creation, and sets up conditions that make "bad times" worse when reversal happens
- At time, Germany was highly dependent on this flow of money that could easily be pulled, and by 1931, American banks and companies held about a billion dollars in short-term German bills (equal to about six percent of German GDP)
- That made both German borrowers and American banks and companies very vulnerable

### Rising Extremism in Germany

- As is typical in such times, economies and wealth disparities fuel rise of populist and extremist leaders globally, with ideological fight between authoritarian left and authoritarian right
- Both German Communist party and **Hitler's Nazi party** made big electoral gains as German economy struggled—with Nazis going from under 3 percent support in 1928 Reichstag elections to over 18 percent in September 1930
- Meanwhile, largest party (center left Social Democratic Party) slipped to less than quarter of Reichstag seats
- Together, far right and far left parties easily had enough parliamentary support to force Germany into unstable multi-party coalition government
- Germany was essentially becoming ungovernable

### Trade War Intensifies Dollar Squeeze

- Global trade war made economic conditions and dollar squeeze worse
- Collapse in global trade depressed foreigners' dollar income, which in turn made it harder for foreigners to service their dollar debts

<!-- pp. 261-280 -->

## The Global Spread of Crisis (1931)

### Trade Collapse and Dollar Shortage

- US imports fell 50% from 1929 to 1931 (both US and UK trade data show steep declines)
- **Chase National Bank** president warned in *Time* (August 1931): companies couldn't obtain enough dollars to cover debts, hurting business
- Dollar shortage made borrowing more expensive, creating **liquidity squeeze** in central Europe

### Germany's Balance of Payments Crisis (May 1931)

- Germany turned to money printing to finance deficits, raising **hyperinflation** fears (echoing early 1920s)
- **Frederic M. Sackett** (US Ambassador) told President Hoover of Germany's weaknesses: capital flight, currency difficulties, unemployment, credit tightening, debt payment pressures, refusals to renew foreign-held German bank accounts
- Germany faced a balance of payments crisis, not just domestic recession

### Austria: Credit Anstalt Failure

- **Credit Anstalt** (Austria's oldest/largest bank) announced $20 million loss on May 8, 1931
- Loss stemmed from 1929 rescue of another failing bank that nearly wiped out its equity
- Bank run ensued, spreading to run on Austrian currency

> "When risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running to limit the impact of their failure on other solvent institutions or the economy at large. Keeping these institutions intact is also important for keeping credit pipes in place for lending to creditworthy borrowers, particularly for financial systems with a concentrated set of lenders."

- **Gold standard constraint**: Austria couldn't print money to provide liquidity
- Other frantic stabilization attempts failed

### Geopolitical Weaponization: France vs. Austria/Germany

- France feared Austria-Germany ties strengthening
- French government encouraged **Bank of France** and other French banks to withdraw short-term credit from Austria
- Geopolitical strains made crisis worse

### US Response: Hoover Moratorium Proposal

- Hoover asked **Treasury Secretary Mellon** and **Secretary of State Henry Stimson** (May 11) to study relieving pressure on German economy
- Proposed relaxing Germany's war debt and reparations payments
- Proposal delayed until early next month

### European Bank Runs Spread (May-July 1931)

- Hungary: bank runs starting in May led to **bank holiday**
- Germany nationalized **Dresdner Bank** (nation's second largest) by buying preferred shares
- Major financial institutions failed across Romania, Latvia, Poland

### German Capital Flight and Monetary Tightening

- Germany's gold/foreign exchange reserves fell **one-third in June** (lowest in five years)
- To stem capital outflow: **Reichsbank raised discount rate to 15%** and collateralized loan rate to 20%
- Stock market collapses: German stocks -14.2%, British stocks -9.8%, French stocks -6.9% (May). US Dow -15% (May), -12.3% (April)

> "The world was imploding."

### Hoover Moratorium (June 1931)

- **June 5**: Hoover suggested one-year moratorium on all intergovernmental payments
- **Paul von Hindenburg** (Weimar Republic president) appealed that Germany was in danger of collapse
- **June 20**: Official announcement—US would forgo $245 million in debt service from Britain, France, and European powers
- Allies had to suspend $385 million in German reparations

### "Moratorium Rally"

- Dow rallied **12% in two days** after announcement, ended month 23% above June 2 low
- German stocks rose 25% first day of trading after announcement
- Commodity prices soared in following weeks

### Moratorium Reality Check

- **July 6**: Final agreement concluded with 15 countries
- German reparations suspended in final deal were lower than Hoover's initial proposal
- France refused to participate but agreed to re-lend reparations back to Germany
- **Dow slumped 4.5%** on the day

### Bear Market Rally Pattern in Depressions

> "The chart below puts things in perspective; the arrow under the grey shaded area shows the moratorium rally. Notice how insignificant that 35 percent rally looks within the bigger moves. I can assure you that those sorts of moves don't seem small when you're going through them."

- Throughout Great Depression: big policy announcements repeatedly produced optimism waves and rallies
- Total decline: almost 90%
- Investors repeatedly disappointed when policy moves insufficient and economy continued deteriorating

> "As noted earlier, bear market rallies like this are classic in a depression, since workers, investors, and policy makers have a strong tendency to exaggerate the importance of relatively small things that appear big close-up."

## Third Quarter, 1931: The Debt Moratorium Fails and the Run on Sterling Begins

### Moratorium Proves Insufficient

- Early July rumors: **Danat Bank** (one of Germany's largest) on verge of failure
- **Reichsbank** viewed it as systemically important, wanted to bail it out but lacked foreign reserves
- **July 8**: Reichsbank president **Hans Luther** reached out to Britain for further debt negotiations and new $1 billion loan
- Policy makers from other countries balked—no one wanted to lend more to Germany

### Hoover's "Standstill Agreement" Proposal

- Required all banks holding German/Central European short-term obligations to keep credit extended
- Exposed them to **big liquidity and potential solvency problems** as they needed cash to meet obligations

> "This was a banker-made crisis… the bankers must shoulder the burden of the solution, not our taxpayers."

> **Hoover's instinct to have the banks bear the cost is a classic but misguided policy response to a debt crisis. Punishing the banks in a way that weakens them makes sense for a few moral and economic reasons, as mentioned in the discussion of the archetypal template, and it can be a political necessity as the public hates the bankers at such times—but it can have disastrous consequences for the financial system and markets.**

- Without forceful policy support, collapse continued and Germany's depression worsened, inciting riots
- **Hitler** gearing up to run for Chancellor with populist stance threatening not to repay reparation debts at all
- July 20 London meeting: foreign ministers slowly arranged three-month loan extension plus standstill agreement
- Result: **classic run on the currency** (as described in archetypal template)

### The Run on Sterling

- Germany's problems proved key **contagion** source
- UK banks had lots of loans to Germany—couldn't get money out
- Foreign investors saw UK banks in trouble, began pulling their money
- **July 24**: France began withdrawing gold from England (interpreted as lack of confidence in pound)
- More countries pulled deposits from Britain—**run on sterling began**

### Bank of England's Defense Measures

- Sold reserves (a third in August alone) and raised interest rates (both classic moves)
- Foreigners watched weekly declines in gold reserves—pressure on pound only increased
- Sought loans from abroad to support currency, but loans effectively **funded flight out of sterling**

### Foreign Loan Requests

- **August 1, 1931**: Bank of England requested US government organize $250 million loan from private US banks (Hoover urged immediate action)
- Flight from sterling continued
- **August 28**: Bank received $200 million from American banks, $200 million from French banks

> "Both loans, however, mostly served to create more fear."

### Britain Abandons Gold Standard (September 19, 1931)

- Having exhausted foreign loans with just over £100 million in gold reserves remaining, Bank of England stopped supporting pound and **let it fall sharply**
- Following day: officially **suspended gold payments** (de facto default)
- Initially, public didn't understand implications—newspapers lamented it as end of an era

### Sterling Devaluation Impact

- Sterling fell **30% over next three months**
- First trading day after gold payments halted: sterling dropped to $3.70 (nearly 25% lower than pre-default $4.86)
- British policy makers didn't intervene to slow fall or maintain stability
- Sterling exchange rates fluctuated greatly before dropping to low of $3.23 (December)
- Over same period: **UK equity market recovered and rose 11%** in local currency terms

### Global Currency Devaluations Follow

- Other countries abandoned gold convertibility to "print money" and devalue currencies
- Most devaluations roughly **30%** (Nordic countries, Portugal, eastern Europe, New Zealand, Australia, India) in line with sterling's devaluation

### Bond Market Impacts

- Investors feared government bonds would be defaulted on with devalued money
- Led to **run out of bonds**, raising interest rates and driving bond prices down
- US: Fed raised interest rates **2%** to attract foreign capital and hold gold peg
- All governments' bonds hit new lows in 1931 except Switzerland and France (declined at least 20% from 1931 highs)
- Global stocks sold off; some markets stopped trading
- **September 21**: only Paris Stock Exchange open in Europe

### UK Recovery After Devaluation

- UK stocks and bonds sold off during currency defense phase and immediately after devaluation, then rebounded
- UK debt denominated in own currency—**no risk government couldn't pay it back**
- UK 5.5% bonds due 1937 dropped to $92 after devaluation from $104 (as interest rates rose 4.7% to 5.7% in December), but moved back to $100 by year end

### Benefits of Devaluation and Money Printing

- Devaluation helped stimulate export sector
- Bank of England eased significantly, cutting rates **one percent by year end**
- Equilibrium reached: by end of October, London banks receiving money again

> **"In other words, the devaluation and money printing kicked off a beautiful deleveraging"** (referenced again when discussing US leaving gold standard)

- Why these moves work explained in archetypal template
- UK stocks and bonds rallied after selling off through currency defense phase and immediately following devaluation
- Commodity weakness offset by currency devaluation; gold prices broke peg

## Fourth Quarter, 1931: The International Crisis Spreads to the US and the Depression Worsens

### Sterling Devaluation Creates US Deflationary Pressure

- As other currencies devalued and dollar rose, created more **deflationary/depressing pressures in US**
- Sterling's September 1931 devaluation stunned global investors, sent shock waves through US markets
- Investors worldwide questioned whether US safe from default or devaluation
- Started selling out of dollar debt positions, raising interest rates and tightening liquidity
- Brought on **most painful period of depression** (lasted until FDR took US off gold standard 18 months later)

### US Market Deterioration

- Stocks sold off during run on sterling
- Dow finished September **down 30.7%** (largest monthly loss since crisis began)
- **October 5**: market fell 10.7% in single day
- NYSE banned short selling (classic attempt to slow sell-off)
- Previously "safe" treasury bonds now selling off with stocks (reflecting US **balance of payments crisis**)
- Yield on long-term US treasuries rose to 4% (nearly 1% above midyear lows)
- Concerns about US Treasury's ability to roll bonds coming due in following two years (due to debt stock and rising debt service)
- Fear of devaluation led to acute runs on US banks
- Banks needed to sell bonds to raise cash, contributing to rising yields

### US Gold Outflows

- Dollar ceased to be safe haven for first time since global debt crisis began
- Gold reserves flowed out following sterling devaluation as central banks (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands) converted dollars to gold
- US lost about **10% of gold reserves** within three weeks following sterling devaluation

### Federal Reserve Tightening (October 1931)

- **October 9**: New York Federal Reserve Bank raised discount rate **1.5% to 2.5%**

> **"Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for the currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic economy, so they don't work."**

- Week later: New York Fed raised rate to **3.5%**
- Rumors: **George Harrison** (New York Fed head) asked French not to withdraw more gold from US

### Bank Runs and Credit Contraction (Late 1931)

- Domestic difficulties led investors to hoard gold and cash
- Series of bank runs in late 1931 caused many banks to close
- Big contraction in deposits for remaining open banks
- As deposits fell, banks called in loans to build cash reserves
- Homes and farms forced into foreclosure
- Several companies went bankrupt as investors didn't roll previously extended loans

### Economic Collapse Accelerates

- Second half of 1931: industrial production contracted **14.3%**, department store sales fell **12.9%**
- By end of 1931: unemployment reached nearly **20%**
- Domestic prices falling **10% per year**

### Hoover Administration Response (Late 1931)

- **National Credit Association** created: pool of private money lent against sound collateral to provide liquidity to at-risk banks (private central bank)
- Funds from banks totaled $500 million, with ability to borrow another billion

### Housing Market Support

- Hoover sought solutions for collapsing real estate market
- Stop foreclosures on "homes and farms of responsible people"
- Created system of **Home Loan Discount Banks** (1932)
- Worked with insurance and real estate agencies to suspend foreclosures on farm loans by Federal Land Banks
- Provided institution with $1 billion to expand lending

### Market Rally (October-November 1931)

- Policies well received, inspired confidence
- Stock market rallied 35% from October bottom to November 9
- **10%+ jump** day National Credit Association announced
- Rally made some believe worst was over (as most significant rallies do)
- No significant change in total money and credit available
- Fundamental imbalance between total debt coming due and money available to service it wasn't resolved
- Rally faded as proposals too small to handle problem
- Stocks reached new low near end of December

## First Half of 1932: Growing Government Intervention Unable to Halt Economic Collapse

### Deepening Depression (1932)

- Depression deepened as economy plunged with deflation and credit problems worsening
- Businesses struggling/failing—aggregate: $2.7 billion in losses and record bankruptcies
- Almost **32,000 failures** and **$928 million in liabilities**
- News of bank failures filled newspapers
- Losses rippled through system, imposing losses on lenders, causing other businesses to close

### Classic Debt Crisis Pattern

> **"It is classic in a big debt crisis: Policy makers play around with deflationary levers to bring down debt for a couple of years but eventually wake up to the fact that the depressing effects of debt reduction and austerity are both too painful and inadequate to produce the effects that are needed. So more aggressive policies are undertaken."**

- Hoover administration announced another policy set (first part of 1932) to provide liquidity and get credit going again

### Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)

- **January 23**: Hoover launched **RFC**
- Funded with $500 million capital
- Could borrow from Treasury or private sources up to $3 billion
- Goal: provide liquidity to solvent banks to shore them up against failure

### RFC's Broader Mandate

- More extensive mandate than Federal Reserve
- Could lend against wider range of collateral and to broader range of entities
- Could lend to state-chartered banks, rural banks not in Federal Reserve System, and railroads (important industry like auto in 2008)

> **"Lending against a widening range of collateral and to an increasingly wide range of borrowers is a classic lever that policy makers pull to ensure that sufficient liquidity gets to the financial system, sometimes provided by central banks and sometimes by central governments."**

### RFC Impact

- By end of August 1932: RFC lent $1.3 billion to 5,520 financial institutions
- Helped reduce bank failures
- **But**: RFC only able to lend against "good" collateral—unable to provide sufficient support to institutions that needed it most

### Banking Act of 1932 and Early Quantitative Easing

- Fed started experimenting with money printing
- Going into crisis: Federal Reserve only able to lend against gold or certain commercial paper (both in short supply)
- Trade-off: further tightening vs. undermining dollar's gold peg

> **"The 1932 Banking Act, signed by Hoover on February 27, attempted to alleviate the liquidity squeeze while maintaining the gold standard by increasing the Federal Reserve's ability to print money, but only to buy government bonds (which 75 years later would be called 'quantitative easing')."**

- Move was contentious (clear weakening of gold standard principles)
- Sense of urgency: bill passed without debate
- Hoover framed it: "in a sense a national defense measure"

> **"Later that year, Congress gave the Federal Reserve additional powers to print money and provide liquidity in an emergency. This provision—Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act—would end up being critical to the Fed's response to the 2008 debt crisis."**

### Federal Reserve Bond Purchases (1932)

- Fed bought nearly $50 million government securities each week (April)
- Nearly $100 million each week (May)
- By June: purchased over $1.5 billion in government securities
- Fed purchases and holdings of government debt shown in charts

### Impact on Treasury Yields

- Once Fed began purchases: yields on short-term Treasury securities fell rapidly
- Three-month T-Bill yields falling more than two percent over first half of year
- Fed purchases relieved pressure in market for longer-term treasury bonds
- Supply-demand imbalance for dollars reached breaking point amid large deficits and foreign reluctance to hold US assets
- After rising above 4.3% (January): yields on ten-year treasuries fell below 3.5% over next six months

### Market Rally (Early 1932)

- Moves ignited optimism and another rally
- Dow Jones increased **19.5%**, reaching January's high
- Closed above 80 in February

### Abandonment of Mark-to-Market Accounting

> **"Another classic move was the abandonment of mark-to-market accounting for banks."**

- January: **Comptroller of the Currency** instructed bank examiners to use par value as intrinsic value of bonds held by national banks with BAA rating or better
- Under prior methodology: banks faced major paper losses on bonds or cash losses if sold
- Losses reduced capital, forcing them to raise money or sell assets
- Further constrained liquidity and pushed down asset prices
- Change in accounting rules relieved immediate pressure on banks

### Macroprudential Pressure on Banks

> **"The Hoover administration also tried to get credit going with macroprudential measures"**

- Applied direct pressure on banks to lend
- Hoover and **Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills** blamed banks for inability to stimulate credit
- Accused them of restricting loans and hoarding gold/cash
- Hoover organized committees in twelve Federal Reserve districts to pressure large regional banks into lending
- Effort met with little success

### Continued Gold Outflows

- None of these moves enough to halt economic collapse
- Pressure on US gold reserves continued (foreigners worried with monetary expansion and expanding deficit, US wouldn't sustain dollar's gold conversion at existing rates)
- They rushed to make conversion—gold left country every month March to June
- **June net gold exports**: $206 million (level last experienced following sterling depreciation)
- Produced credit tightening

### Market Decline (March-May 1932)

- March: stocks sold off
- Market decline extended through 11 weeks
- Dow Jones dropped **50%** (88 on March 8 to 44 on May 31)
- Dow closed May on low for month
- Volume declined to about 750,000 shares per day
- Early in crisis: government efforts to increase lending and spending led to sustained rallies
- At this stage: investors disillusioned
- Worried Hoover's programs not making enough difference to make up for vast cost
- Markets continued trending downward

### Rising Social Unrest (1932)

> **"Social unrest and conflict continued to rise globally."**

- Germany: **Hitler won most seats in Reichstag election**
- Japan slipped toward militarism: invading Manchuria (1931) and Shanghai (1932)
- US: strikes and protests increasing
- Unemployment approaching 25%
- Those employed faced wage cuts
- Outside cities: farmers faced ruin as prices fell and drought destroyed crops

### Bonus Army March

- Thousands of veterans and families marched on Washington (June), stayed there
- Attempted to pressure government to immediately pay them veterans' bonuses
- **July 28**: US Army troops led by **General Douglas MacArthur** cleared camp with tanks and tear gas
- Conflicts within/between countries intensified
- Sowed seeds of **populism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and militarism**
- Led to economic warfare then military warfare in Europe (September 1939) and with Japan (December 1941)

## Second Half of 1932: Further Contractions and the Election of FDR

### Summer Rally (1932)

- By summer: big stimulation and relief to banks appeared helping
- Downward spiral began to moderate
- Asset prices stabilized
- Production actually increased in certain areas (like autos)
- May-June: commodities, stocks, bonds all bottomed
- Markets improved during second half of year
- **August-September**: Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to peak of **80** (almost double July low)

### Time Magazine on Rally (August 8, 1932)

- Rally occurred because: gold outflow finally ceased, rumors of foreign capital coming to country, railroad merger approved

### Policy Pullback

- As optimism about economy and asset markets increased: policy makers began pulling back on earlier stimulative measures
- RFC weakened significantly by scandal when it bailed out **Central Republic Bank and Trust** (headed by previous chair
<!-- pp. 281-300 -->

## 1932: Political Backlash and Policy Paralysis

### The RFC Crisis and Public Outrage

- Congress ordered the **RFC** to publish names of all institutions receiving loans, effectively requiring borrowers to advertise they were in trouble
- This worsened depositor withdrawal pressure; RFC borrowing slowed and withdrawals accelerated
- **Main Street vs. Wall Street conflict**: Populist calls to "punish the bankers" made it incredibly difficult for policy makers to save the financial system and economy
- Political pressure ended Fed's government bond purchases despite their effectiveness

### Hoover's Fatal Budget Austerity

- Revenue Act of 1932 raised income taxes, corporation taxes, and excise taxes
- **Despite tax increases, budget deficit grew relative to GDP because austerity was contractionary** — economy shrank faster than deficit declined
- **Classic rookie move in depressions**: Hoover's attempt to balance the budget through austerity

### Roosevelt's Populist Campaign (1932)

- Campaign struck anti-speculator tone, calling for federal control of exchanges
- Indicated support for dollar devaluation, increasing currency pressure
- Promised to maintain gold standard publicly, but **politicians' disingenuous promises should never be believed** — they're expedient and inconsistent with economic fundamentals
- **Roosevelt won 22.8 million votes to Hoover's 15.8 million** (most popular vote total to that time)

### Economic and Political Context

- Consumer spending and production fell >20%, unemployment rose >16%
- Severe deflation: prices falling ~1% per month
- **Policy makers' reliance on deflationary debt reduction levers pushed US into severe depression/"ugly deleveraging"** — nominal rates well above nominal growth, so debt grew faster than income
- Debate became antagonistically political with strong populist overtones

### Global Populism Wave

- Weak economy, uneven recovery (elite prospering while common man struggled), and ineffectual policy makers fueled global populism (1920s-1930s)
- **US inequality peaked early 1930s**: top 10% earned 45% of income, owned 85% of wealth; unemployment >20%
- FDR's "New Deal" promised big changes for workers, debtors, unemployed
- **Germany**: hyperinflation + Depression, top 10% earned ~40% income, unemployment >25% — set stage for Nazi party's ascent

### November 1932: Crisis Deepens

- **Nevada declared first statewide bank holiday** (November) — sparked national panic
- Bank failures accelerating, open market operations ended, RFC neutered, government spending cut, devaluation threat looming
- Gold outflows resumed, economy's downward trajectory steepened
- 1932 economic collapse was breathtaking

## 1933: Preinauguration

### Roosevelt's Refusal to Reaffirm Gold Standard

- Gold flowed out in anticipation of reflationary policies
- Roosevelt refused to reaffirm gold commitment despite pleas from advisors
- **Senator Carter Glass** refused Treasury Secretary nomination unless Roosevelt guaranteed gold standard
- **Hoover** wrote personal letter requesting Roosevelt clarify his policies
- European investors worried; *New York Times* reported confusion about dollar's future — "Declaration by Mr. Roosevelt declaring firm resolution to maintain a sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect"
- Roosevelt stayed silent

### Guardian Detroit Crisis (February 1933)

- **Guardian Detroit Union Group** (largest Michigan financial institution) sought RFC loan but had little collateral
- Main shareholder: **Henry Ford**
- RFC suggested Ford provide support; **Ford refused**, recognizing Guardian Trust was systemically important as Central Republic
- Union Guardian Trust and Guardian National Bank allowed to fail; **Michigan declared statewide bank holiday**

### Systemic Contagion

- **When policy makers fail to rescue systemically important institutions, ripple effects spread quickly**
- Michigan was industrial heartland — impact on other states especially large
- Households and companies rushed to withdraw savings nationwide
- Ohio, Arkansas, Indiana suffered runs; Maryland bank holiday Feb 25
- By March 4: withdrawal restrictions in over 30 states

### Gold Reserve Hemorrhage

- Last two weeks of February: New York Fed lost **$250 million** (nearly 25% of gold reserves)
- Hoover attempted War Powers Act and capital controls but Democrats blocked
- March 1933: GNP hit lowest point of entire depression — **$55.6 billion, 31.5% below 1929 level**

## 1933-1937: The Beautiful Deleveraging

### March 5, 1933: Roosevelt's Decisive Action

- **Four-day national bank holiday**, suspended gold exports (delinking from gold), assembled rescue team
- **Emergency Banking Act of 1933**: extended holiday, gave Fed and Treasury unprecedented powers to provide liquidity and capital
- **Critical innovation**: Fed could issue dollars backed by bank assets instead of gold — **broke link between dollar and gold, allowed Fed to print money and provide liquidity banks desperately needed**
- Roosevelt banned gold exports under 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act

### Bank Audit and Triage

- Auditors worked through every US bank's books, starting with largest and safest
- **Systemically important banks were always supported; smaller banks often allowed to fail**
- Undercapitalized banks: (a) RFC issued preferred shares, (b) merged with healthier bank, or (c) closed
- Sound banks could reopen and borrow from Fed using any assets as collateral
- Treasury agreed to cover Fed losses — **guaranteeing liabilities of every bank they chose to keep open**

### Roosevelt's Radio Address (March 12)

> The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks which reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call...It is sound currency because it is backed by actual, good assets...I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.

### Public Confidence Restored

- Instead of runs, public deposited **>$1 billion** into banks when they reopened
- Classic example: **debt and liquidity problems prompted by runs can be rectified by providing liquidity rather than holding it back**
- Within one month: member banks representing 90% of deposits had reopened
- When markets opened Wednesday: **Dow rose 15.3%**, commodities soared

### Dalio's Personal Reflection

- Breaking gold link in 1933 identical to August 1971 (when Dalio was clerking at NYSE)
- In 1971, thought crisis would send stocks/economy down — **was painfully wrong**
- Same dynamics as 1933, same reasons
- **First time surprised by events that hadn't happened in his lifetime but had happened many times in history**
- Drove him to study all big market/economic movements across time frames and economies
- Developed **timeless and universal principles** for dealing with crises
- These principles saved him multiple times (e.g., 2008)
- **Events in 1930s have happened many times before for exact same reasons**

### The Beautiful Deleveraging Mechanism

- Dollar plunged vs. currencies and gold after printing money
- Within two weeks of leaving gold peg: Fed decreased liquidity injections
- Short-term rates fell 1% to 2%, bankers' acceptance rates dropped to 2%, call loan rates decreased to 3%
- Money supply increased 1.5% over three months
- **Dow up almost 100% over next four months**
- Depression ended on a dime (though GDP didn't match 1929 peak until 1936)
- **Leaving gold peg was the turning point** — all markets and statistics bottomed exactly then
- Recovery benefited rich more than poor; post-1933 remained difficult for many (why people think depression lasted through 1930s)

### Roosevelt's Policy Avalanche (First Six Months)

**Regulatory Changes** (typical at end of big debt crises):
- **April 5 and 18**: Outlawed public ownership of monetary gold; outlawed private gold exports (devaluing and printing money)
- **May 27**: Securities Act of 1933 regulated securities sale (increased regulation)
- **June 5**: Banned "Gold Clauses" in contracts (big debt restructuring — gold had increased in value after dollar delinked)
- **June 13**: Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) refinanced residential mortgages — 1 million people received long-term loans 1933-1935 (restructuring debts)
- **June 16**: Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall II) — FDIC deposit insurance up to $2,500; Fed regulation of interest rates (Regulation Q); stringent bank regulations; separation of investment and commercial banking (establish deposit insurance, increased regulation)

**Fiscal Stimulus**:
- Federal spending had fallen >$1 billion in 1932 as Hoover tightened
- Though FDR initially campaigned to balance budget, policies increased annual spending **$2.7 billion (5% of GDP) by 1934**
- **April 5**: Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) — employed 2.5 million in public works over nine years
- **May 12**: Federal Emergency Relief Act — $500 million for household financial support
- **May 18**: Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) — massive infrastructure investment (power, flood control, irrigation)
- **June 16**: National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) created Public Works Administration (PWA) — $3.3 billion for large-scale public works

### Beautiful Deleveraging Formula

- **Balance is key**: Deleveragings become beautiful when there's enough stimulation to offset deflationary forces and bring nominal growth rate above nominal interest rate
- Deflation turned into acceptable inflation
- Heavy machinery orders climbed 100%, industrial production increased ~50%
- March-July: nondurable manufacturing up 35%, durable manufacturing up 83%
- Unemployment fell, wholesale prices jumped 45%
- **Rebounding from very depressed levels fed on themselves to make beautiful deleveraging**

### GDP Growth Above Interest Rates

- Charts show nominal growth rose above nominal interest rates after FDR left gold standard
- Total debt level (%GDP) began declining
- "Beautiful Deleveraging" period clearly marked on charts

## 1935: The Goldilocks Period

### Economic Recovery and Fed Concerns

- Economy and markets recovered through 1934 into 1935
- By 1935: economy recovered, deflation disappeared, stocks soared
- Home prices rising >10% per year
- Equity price recovery even faster
- Wealth and output remained below pre-depression bubble levels

### Fed Debates Excess Reserves

- Spring 1935: Fed increasingly concerned about rising excess reserves
- Feared excess reserves could create credit expansion and future inflation
- March background memo recommended no action for time being
- Explored whether excess reserves would push down government securities yields and encourage private lending (no evidence yet)
- Second issue: how to sell accumulated debt (reverse QE)
- Paper rejected action, saying it would prematurely emphasize inflation concerns before signs materialized

### Stock Market Bubble Fears

- October memo expressed heightened concerns about excess reserves
- Pondered appropriate time to reduce them: (1) asset sales or (2) increasing reserve requirements
- Argument for reducing: get ahead of future inflation
- Argument against: no evidence yet for restraint

### November 1935 Press Release

- Fed discussed stock market boom and inflation concerns
- **Fears of fueling bubble were rampant** — policy makers remembered late 1920s bubble caused stock market bust and contributed to depression
- Very worried steep 1935 stock rise (nearly quadrupling) could fuel recurrence
- Treasury disagreed, noting inflation still far off

### Speculative Credit Monitoring

- Fed paid attention to how stock purchases were financed
- Heightened concerns about "speculative credit" after excess margin-borrowing in late 1920s
- November memo noted purchases financed by money, not credit, so no action taken
- Still, stock advance considered emerging bubble; fears about too-easy monetary policy remained
- **George Harrison** (New York Fed) suggested raising reserve requirements to curtail stock price rise
- **Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau** rejected this notion but recognized inflation concern
- **Emanuel Goldenweiser** (Fed head of research) warned of negative psychological reaction to raising requirements
- Recommended press release saying reserve action would be "precautionary" and "there is no need to worry about inflation at this time" given unused plant capacity and unemployment
- End of 1935: Fed press release stated reserves and gold inflows "continues to be excessive" and warned "appropriate action may be taken as soon as it appears in the public interest"

## 1936-1938: The Tightening Causes Recession

### Debate Over Reserve Requirements (1936)

- FDR wanted to signal inflation concern ahead of election — urged reserve requirements be tightened spring 1936
- **Fed Chairman Eccles** worried banks would accumulate bonds/loans at low rates and get burned by inflation
- May 1936: Fed did not move (Banking Act of 1935 meant Morgenthau had to resign from board but still had influence)

### July 1936: The Tightening Begins

- **Eccles met alone with FDR**, explaining intention to raise reserves and assuring president he wouldn't act if interest rates rose and Fed would buy bonds if they sold off
- Fed tightened reserves later that month
- Eccles and Fed moved without informing Morgenthau (who was furious)
- After tiny bond sell-off, Morgenthau ordered Harrison (New York Fed) to purchase bonds using Treasury's accounts
- Fed Board in Washington joined in, buying bonds and selling bills as Eccles had promised
- **August 1936-May 1937**: Fed doubled reserve requirements from ~8% to 16%
- First tightening (August 1936) did not hurt stock prices or economy

### **Classic Pattern: First Tightening Does Not Hurt Stocks and Economy**

<!-- pp. 301-320 -->

### Policy Tightening in 1936-1937

#### Reserve Requirement Increases

- Reserve tightening occurred in three phases: August 1936, March 1937, and May 1937
- March 1937 was the largest increase (about half the total)
- Deposit reserve requirements increased dramatically:
  - **Central Reserve City**: 13.0% → 26.0%
  - **Reserve City**: 10% → 20%
  - **Country**: 7.0% → 14.0%
  - **Time Deposits (All Member Banks)**: 3.0% → 6.0%
- Excess reserves fell from $3 billion to less than $1 billion

#### Currency Devaluation Wars

- Monetary policy tightening intensified by currency devaluations from **France** and **Switzerland**
- **Tripartite Agreement** (September 1936): US, Britain, and France agreed to refrain from competitive exchange devaluations
- By then, all countries could easily devalue in response to others, creating economic turbulence but leaving relative positions unchanged
- All currencies devalued against gold, but not much against each other

### Gold Inflows and Policy Concerns (1936)

#### Three Concerns About Gold Inflows

1. **Rapid rise in the stock market**: Stocks up 4x from 1933 bottom; rose ~40% in 1935 and 25% in 1936. Policymakers worried foreign capital was inflating US stock prices
2. **Inflationary impact**: Inflation rose from ~0% to ~2% by October 1936
3. **Vulnerability to capital outflow**: Fear that European nations would finance war by selling US assets and withdrawing gold, while preventing US holders from repatriating capital

#### Gold Sterilization Policy

- **FDR ordered "sterilization"** beginning December 1936
- Normal gold purchases printed money; sterilization instead drew down Treasury's cash account at the Fed (no new money printed)
- December 23, 1936 to July 1937: Treasury sterilized ~$1.3 billion in gold inflows (~1.5% of GDP)
- Fed also tightened reserve requirements to take money out of circulation

### The 1937 Downturn

#### Early 1937 Conditions

- Economy remained strong: stock market rising, industrial production healthy, inflation ~5%
- Second and third reserve tightenings in March and May 1937
- Neither Fed nor Treasury anticipated that tightening + sterilization would push rates higher, but reduced liquidity caused bond sell-off and short rate spike

#### Policy Clash: Morgenthau vs. Eccles

- **Treasury Secretary Morgenthau** was furious, argued Fed should offset the "panic" through open market bond purchases
- He ordered Treasury into the market to purchase bonds itself
- **Fed Chairman Eccles** pushed back, urged Morgenthau to balance the budget and raise tax rates to retire debt

#### Fiscal Tightening

- Federal government outlays fell 10% in 1937 and another 10% in 1938
- **Revenue Act of 1937**: closed loopholes in Revenue Act of 1935 (the "wealth tax"), which had raised top income tax to 75%
- Federal budget deficit went from ~-4% of GDP to neutral
- Driven largely by Social Security tax increase, with smaller spending cuts

#### Inequality and Labor Unrest

- Recovery perceived as uneven (benefiting elites over common workers)
- Workers saw corporate profit gains but no wage increases
- Strike activity surged: 118% increase in number of strikes, 136% increase in workers involved (1936 to 1937)

#### Economic Collapse

- **Monetary and fiscal tightening** created significant sell-off in risky assets
- Stocks fell most; home prices stopped gaining and dipped negative
- Credit growth slowed across all sectors:
  - Nonfinancial business credit: -2%
  - Household credit: -1%
- Unemployment rose to 15% (though brief compared to early 1930s)
- **Stocks bottomed April 1938, declining nearly 60% total**

### Late 1937-1938: Policy Reversal

#### Monetary Easing

- Fed accelerated twist into longer-dated assets, began small net asset purchases by year-end
- Treasury reversed sterilization program in partnership with Fed by end of 1937
- Money growth picked up in 1938 with reverse sterilization and renewed money printing
- Gold inflows slowed, economy and asset prices deteriorated
- Money growth eventually outpaced gold reserve growth

#### Fed's "Twist" Operation

- Fed bought long-term bonds while selling bills and notes (started in 1936)
- Increased net assets by small amount (~3% by 1938)

#### Spring 1938: Further Stimulus

- Fed lowered reserve requirements back to 1936 levels, releasing ~$750 million
- Federal government increased deficit spending in 1938 and 1939 heading into war
- Deficit rose from nearly balanced at start of 1938 to almost 3% of GDP by start of 1939
- Deficit spending above 2% of GDP continued throughout the year

#### Recovery

- Stock market began recovering in 1938 (didn't fully regain 1937 highs until end of war nearly a decade later)
- Credit flows and economy recovered in 1939 following stimulus and war entry

### The Path to War

#### Economic-Geopolitical Linkages

- Economics and geopolitics highly intertwined in the 1930s
- **Germany** and **Japan**: internal conflicts between haves (Right) and have-nots (Left) led to populist, autocratic, nationalistic, militaristic leaders
- These leaders given autocratic powers to bring order to badly-managed economies
- External conflicts arose as these countries became rival economic and military powers to existing world powers

#### Thucydides's Trap

> "Rivalries between countries lead to wars in order to establish which country is more powerful, which are then followed by periods of peace in which the dominant power/powers get to set the rules because no country can fight them until a rival power emerges, at which time they do it all over again."

- Wars really started ~10 years before official 1939/1941 dates, as economic conflicts progressively grew into WWII
- Germany and Japan competed with UK, US, and France for resources and territorial influence
- War culminated in establishing US as dominant power, dictating new world order
- This peace continues until the same process happens again

### Timeline of Key Events (1930-1941)

#### 1930
- **Smoot-Hawley Tariff** began trade war

#### 1931
- **Japan invaded Manchuria, China** for natural resources due to inadequate resources and severe rural poverty
- US wanted to keep China free from Japanese control; competed for oil, rubber, and tin from Southeast Asia

- Within two months: took total authoritarian control via **Enabling Act** (using national security excuse)
- Refused reparations payments, stepped out of League of Nations, took control of media
- Created top-down command economy: involved in Volkswagen setup, German Autobahn construction
- Believed Germany limited by geographic boundaries, lacked raw materials for industrial military complex, German people should be ethnically united

#### 1934
- Severe famine in parts of Japan caused political turbulence, reinforced right-wing militaristic nationalism
- Free market failure strengthened command economy

#### 1936
- Germany took back Rhineland militarily; in 1938, annexed Austria
- Japan signed pact with Germany
- Fed tightening caused fragile economy to weaken; other major economies weakened with it

#### 1937

#### September 1940-1941
- Japan invaded several Southeast Asian colonies (starting with French Indochina)
- 1941: Japan seized oil reserves in Dutch East Indies to create **"Southern Resource Zone"** within **"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"**
- Southern Resource Zone: European colonies in Southeast Asia providing oil, rubber, rice
- Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: Asian countries controlled by Japan, not Western powers
- Japan occupied naval base near Manila, threatening attack on Philippines (US protectorate)

#### 1941
- **Lend-Lease policy**: US sent oil, food, weaponry to Allied Nations for free (~$650 billion in today's dollars); ended US neutrality
- Summer 1941: **Roosevelt froze all Japanese assets** in US and **embargoed all oil and gas exports** to Japan
- Japan calculated it would be out of oil in two years

#### December 1941: Pearl Harbor
- Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and British/Dutch colonies in Asia
- Goal: destroy Pacific Fleet threatening Japan, not necessarily win the war
- Japan believed US weakened by fighting on two fronts (Europe and Pacific) and by political system
- Japan thought totalitarianism and command military industrial complex superior to US individualistic/capitalist approach

### News & Federal Reserve Bulletin

*[Pages 315-320 contain historical newspaper headlines and Federal Reserve Bulletin excerpts from 1925-1929, documenting the progression from prosperity through the stock market boom to the crash. Key themes include: record corporate earnings, rising stock prices, Federal Reserve warnings about speculation, increasing broker loans, debate over rate policy, and ultimately the October 1929 crash.]*

## US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007-2011)

### Introduction: Framework and Approach

This section provides a detailed account of the **2007-2011 US debt crisis**, written with reference to the **Archetypal Big Debt Cycle template**. Key connections to watch:

- **Pooling and securitization of mortgages** = new ways of providing leverage outside regulatory protection
- **Levering up of investment banks** = unregulated leverage expansion
- **Rapid growth of derivatives** traded off regulated exchanges = shadow banking system

> "Please note how well the particulars of this case fit with the generalizations described in the template. For example, when you read about the pooling and securitization of mortgages, the levering up of investment banks, and the rapid growth of derivatives that were traded off of regulated exchanges, see these as new ways of providing leverage outside the protection and regulation of authorities."

**Author's pedagogical goal**: convey the day-by-day experience to help readers think through decisions as both investors and policymakers. The narrative follows a week-by-week (sometimes day-by-day) timeline with contemporary news articles and Bridgewater Daily Observations excerpts.

**Key principle**: Investment positions are proprietary and not described, but the thinking process is fully shared.

## The Emerging Bubble: 2004-2006

### The Goldilocks Economy

**Economic context (2004-2006)**:
- Growth: steady 3-4%
- Unemployment: below long-term average at 4-5%
- Inflation: mostly 2-3.5% (higher than ideal but not worrisome)
- **Debt/GDP growth**: 12.6% annually
- Fed raised rates gradually from 1% (2004) to just over 5% (2006)

> "The economy appeared to most people as though it was in a 'Goldilocks' period—not too hot and not too cold."

**Classic bubble dynamics**: Central banks focus on inflation and growth (not a problem) while ignoring debt-financed asset purchases.

**Why bubbles emerge undetected**:
- Often hidden beneath aggregate averages
- Concentrated in specific markets (housing in this case)
- Require **pro forma financial stress tests** to identify vulnerabilities and knock-on effects

---

### The Housing Market Debt Bubble

**Price acceleration**:
- 2004-2006: home prices increased ~30%
- Since 2000: >80% total increase
- **Fastest pace in a century** (except immediate post-WWII period)

**Leverage magnification effect**: Home price gains have **magnified impacts on equity values**
- Example: $50,000 down payment on $250,000 house → house rises to $350,000 → **investment tripled**
- Enabled more borrowing, attracted new buyers and lenders (highly profitable)

**Debt explosion**:
- Household debt rose from 85% of disposable income (2000) to ~120% (2006)
- **Bottom quintile of income earners** showed biggest percentage increase in debt (2001-2007)
- Home equity loans and cash-out refinancing: **$500 billion in 2005** (5x the 1998 level)
- Total US debt exceeded **300% of GDP**

**Self-reinforcing dynamics**: Rising prices → lowered credit standards → more lending/buying → even higher prices

> "The more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered (even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), but both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying houses on borrowed money to be very profitable."

---

### Classic Bubble Characteristics

**Seven defining features** (all present in US housing 2004-2006):

1. **Prices high relative to traditional measures**
2. **Prices discounting future rapid appreciation** from already-high levels
3. **Broad bullish sentiment**
4. **Purchases financed by high leverage**
5. **Extended forward purchases** (built inventory, contracted purchases) to speculate or protect against future gains
6. **New buyers** (previously not in market) have entered
7. **Stimulative monetary policy** helps inflate bubble; **tight policy** contributes to popping

**Speculative behavior**:
- "Home flippers" buying for short-term profit
- New single-family home construction **doubled between 1995 and 2005**
- Peak: just shy of **8% of households buying a home each year** (50% more than today)
- TIME magazine (summer 2005): "Will Your House Make You Rich?"

**Supply-demand irrationality**: Higher prices encouraged production AND leveraged buying—precisely the opposite of what logic would dictate.

> "Logic should dictate precisely the opposite behavior: those betting on price changes ought to be more inclined to deleverage or sell, and those who lend to them should be more cautious when these things are happening. However, this sort of nonsensical thinking is typical in bubbles."

### Mortgage Market Froth

**Interest rates at historic lows**:
- Fell to lows in 2003 not seen since the 1950s
- Stayed near those lows well into the housing bubble
- **Leveraging accelerated 2003-2007** even as rates rose ~1.5% (2005-2007)

**Loan-to-value ratio on new housing loans**: fast increase to **80%**
- Higher numbers = smaller down-payments, larger loans
- Banks **more eager to loan, willing to make riskier bets**

**Signs of lending froth**:
- Banks often didn't require **proof of income**
- **Adjustable rate mortgages** with low "teaser" rates now, higher rates later
- **"Subprime" mortgages** (riskier loans) became 20% of market
- **Securitization** packaged debt in ways that obscured underlying risks
- Low interest rates fueled easy credit availability

### Fed Policy Mistake: Focus on CPI, Not Debt

Despite massive debt build-up and frenzied housing activity, **economy didn't overheat and inflation remained moderate** → Fed remained unconcerned.

**Critical insight**: The worst debt bubbles (US 1929, Japan 1989) are **not accompanied by high/rising goods and services inflation**, but by **asset price inflation financed by debt growth**.

> "It is typically the case that the worst debt bubbles (e.g., the US in 1929, Japan in 1989) are not accompanied by high and rising goods and services inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. Typically, central banks make the mistake of accommodating the debt growth because they are focused on goods and services inflation (as measured by the CPI) and/or growth. They are not focused on debt growth, which is what they are creating, and on whether the debts will produce the incomes to service them."

**Real interest rates**:
- US short-term rates **below inflation** (negative real borrowing costs) from late 2001 to early 2006
- Even when Fed raised short-term rates (mid-2004), **long-term nominal rates remained flat**, real long-term rates **declined**
- Same pattern broadly true across developed world

---

### Paulson's Concerns and the Working Group

**Mid-2006**: **Hank Paulson** confirmed as Treasury Secretary (from Goldman Sachs CEO)
- Market exposure made him concerned about financial excesses
- Convened regular meetings of **President's Working Group on Financial Markets**
- Members: top Bush economic team and key regulators
- **Primary benefit**: built close working relationships among Paulson, **Ben Bernanke** (Fed Chairman), **Tim Geithner** (NY Fed President)

**Key personalities**:
- **Paulson**: extroverted former CEO, bold decision-maker
- **Bernanke**: introverted economist, well-schooled in Great Depression
- **Geithner**: practical operator experienced in government policy
- **Complementary qualities** + hourly coordination + willingness to be bold and evolve quickly = critical to navigating crisis

**What they saw (2006)**:
- Concerned about "dry tinder and gathering storm"
- Tried to lean against perceived excesses
- Noted excesses in **subprime market**
- **Did NOT see** subprime spilling over to overall housing market (which hadn't seen nationwide decline since WWII)
- **Paulson very concerned** about **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac** (GSEs) risks—also highlighted by **Larry Summers**

### Summary: The Bubble Inflates

**Economic surface**: appears healthy (Goldilocks)
**Underneath**: classic debt bubble dynamics
- **Home prices** rising 30% (2004-2006), 80%+ since 2000
- **Household debt** from 85% to 120% of disposable income
- **Total debt** >300% of GDP
- **Credit standards** deteriorating as prices rise
- **Speculation** rampant (flippers, new construction doubling)
- **Fed accommodation** via low rates despite debt explosion
- **Securitization** obscuring risk

**Policy blind spot**: Fed watching CPI and growth, not debt growth or asset price inflation—**classic central bank error** that allows worst bubbles to form.

<!-- pp. 381-400 -->

## The Emerging Broader-Based Bubble

### Economic Imbalances Beyond Housing

- Savings rates declined from low to lower; US aggressively imported capital from abroad
- Manufacturing employment fell sharply as US lost global export market share to emerging economies (especially **China**)
- Housing activity camouflaged structural weakness: construction employment rose ~50% vs. 1995, driven by debt-financed building

### Debt Growth as Red Flag

> **High debt growth to fund consumption rather than investment is a red flag, since consumption doesn't produce an income, while investment might.**

- Typical bubble pattern: foreign capital poured in (current account deficit swelled to 6% of GDP)
- Money came from emerging economies like China with huge surpluses, choosing to save/invest in US assets
- Strong capital inflows enabled US citizens to borrow and consume beyond their earnings
- Foreign demand for US assets kept long-term borrowing costs low even as Fed raised short-term rates (late 2004)

### The Shadow Banking System

**Shadow banking** = growth of lending outside the regulated banking system, a common feature of bubble periods

Five key components fueled leveraging outside traditional banking:

1. **Repo agreements and commercial paper** - huge channels for short-term borrowing by banks and corporations. **Ben Bernanke** notes repo liabilities of US broker dealers increased 2.5x in four years before crisis
2. **Large institutional depositors outside protected banking system** - demand for Treasury securities (especially from foreign investors) outstripped supply, creating shortage of safe assets. Led to demand for substitutes like asset-backed commercial paper and repo
3. **Money market funds** - short-term savings vehicle promising higher returns than bank accounts without much additional risk
4. **Globalization of dollar lending** - explosion of dollar borrowing and lending outside US banks
5. **Securitization of lending** - banks originate loans (auto, home, etc.) and sell them to investors. Creates **moral hazard**: banks incentivized to make risky loans since they can sell them and not bear consequences (as long as investors remain willing to buy)

### Regulatory Failure

- US regulatory system didn't keep pace with shadow banking developments
- No adequate visibility into shadow banks and markets
- Authorities lacked powers to curb excesses (though this wasn't apparent initially)
- Banks and shadow banks inadequately capitalized and over-leveraged—little cushion, exposed to solvency problems in downturn
- 1990s-2000s era: regulators concerned about US financial industry staying competitive with London, discouraging tighter reins

**Critical point**: If debt boom had been financed by traditional banking system, crisis would have been easier to manage and contain. FDIC's systemic risk exemption powers + deposit insurance + Fed's discount window would have had more power and reach. Less forced selling, less dangerous margin spiral.

### The Bubble's Drivers

Not just low interest rates—combination of:
- Easy money
- Lax regulation
- Risky financial innovations

Fed focused on inflation (not debt growth) when setting rates. Policy makers allowed lax regulation of shadow lending to continue.

### Asset/Liability Mismatches

**Classic ingredient of severe debt crisis**: borrowers/lenders had severe asset/liability mismatches, leaving them vulnerable in downturn

Three common forms:

1. **Borrowing short-term and lending long-term** - squeezed when short-term lenders refuse to roll over or demand much higher rates than earnings on long-term loans already made
2. **Lending to risky borrowers at higher rates to collect credit spread**—until default rates exceed the spread
3. **Borrowing in one currency, lending/investing in another** - when borrowed currency rises, forces repayment at higher exchange rate or interest rate than manageable

All three occurred during this bubble, making financial intermediaries and their investors highly vulnerable to runs and credit problems.

**Example**: European banks actively borrowed dollars short-term, then lent globally. When dollar credit tightened (summer 2007), these banks lost US money market access and became contagion transmitters worldwide.

### The Top: 2007

**First Half of 2007**

- Markets and economy doing great: stocks hitting new highs, strong job market, strong retail sales, strong consumer sentiment
- Housing market and aggressive financers showing cracks
- **SEC** memo (January 4): "business model of many smaller subprime originators is no longer viable" after refinancing and real estate booms ended
- Markets tranquil Feb-March; credit spreads relatively low vs. historical norms

**Subprime Problems Grow**

- Subprime lenders facing considerable losses but not yet affecting broader economy/markets
- Bigger banks reporting rising bad mortgage debts

**(BDO) March 13: Subprime Mortgage Fallout**

> **Over the last few years, investment banks have been hard at work creating fancy new products where they can package up a bunch of assets and sell the package for more than the sum of the parts** (CDOs, CMOs, synthetic CDOs, etc.)

- Tranching creates AAA-rated bonds from lower-quality assets
- **This innovation opened credit to risky borrowers (not just households) who previously had trouble accessing credit markets**
- Explosion in subprime mortgages closely related to this new credit source
- Originators paid less attention to underwriting—just handing off to investment banks for packaging and resale
- Lending standards slipped to absurdly low levels
- Small uptick in delinquencies → banks refused to buy loans → originators stuck with losses

**Early payment defaults** hammered subprime lenders. Agreements required lenders to buy back loans if borrowers missed first few payments. **New Century** (second biggest subprime lender, 2006): 2.5% of loans had first payment defaults. Couldn't come up with cash for buybacks. Dozens of smaller lenders went bust; New Century was the biggest.

**Bernanke** (March 28 Congressional testimony): "impact on broader economy and financial markets of problems in subprime market seems likely to be contained." Dalio had similar assessment initially, though more concerned about leverage and tightening.

**Stock Rally Continues**

- US stocks rallied through April-May, hitting new records
- Mid-June: 10-year Treasury yields hit 5.3% (highest since 2002)
- Mid-July: 90-day T-bill rate hit 5%, very flat yield curve—**cyclical peak**

### Interest Rate Mechanics

**Rising rates increase debt service on both new and existing variable-rate debt**:
- Discourages additional borrowing (credit becomes expensive)
- Reduces disposable income (more spent on debt service)
- Spending slows
- One person's spending = another's income
- Incomes drop
- **When people spend less, prices go down, and economic activity decreases**

**Simultaneously**: rising short-term rates + flattening/inverting yield curve → liquidity declines. Short duration assets (cash) become relatively more attractive vs. longer duration assets (bonds, equities, real estate) and lower-grade credit. **Money moves out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices create negative wealth effects, feeding back into economy through declining spending and incomes.**

### The Tightening Pops the Bubble

Rising rates → home prices began declining (higher debt service on new homes, rising payments on existing ARMs for subprime borrowers)

June: tightening pressures flowed through to first broad financial distress sign—rising foreclosures and delinquencies translating to meaningful losses for bigger banks

**Bear Stearns Hedge Funds Crisis** (mid-June):
- Two hedge funds holding subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS), one leveraged ~20:1, faced growing losses and investor redemption wave
- Required fire-sale of $3.6 billion in securities (large amount for the market)
- Leveraged financial buying shifted to deleveraging selling
- As securities prices fell, hedge funds faced huge losses and forced liquidations
- Bear Stearns eventually promised $3.2 billion loan (later reduced to $1.6 billion) to bail out one fund
- Other banks that seized collateral cooperated to keep market stable (not selling more subprime MBS)
- Funds eventually wiped out
- Small funds, limited initial reverberations

### Summer 2007

Economic growth remained healthy; equity markets hit new highs mid-July. Key question: would Fed tighten (inflation concerns) or ease (housing concerns)?

Stress in housing market gradually building:
- Subprime MBS indices (**ABX**) saw big price declines (even AAA bonds fell ~5%)
- Mortgage lenders reporting increasing missed payments
- One large lender nearing bankruptcy
- Small German bank exposed to mortgage loans faced big losses, acquired by Germany's state bank
- New home sales falling very quickly

Markets sold off (July down 6% from peak)

### Self-Reinforcing Debt Crisis Dynamics

**Mark-to-market accounting + high leverage** made crisis self-reinforcing:

> **Debt crises and downturns are self-reinforcing behaviors because as losses occur, both lenders and borrowers are less able to lend and borrow, which worsens conditions. For example, when losses occur, one's capital declines, and because there are limits to how much one can hold in assets relative to one's capital, that means assets have to be sold, or the buying of assets has to be curtailed. That in turn makes asset prices and lending weaker, producing more losses and reinforcing the cycle further.**

Dalio's team ran detailed mark-to-market stress tests showing financial sector and dependents were incurring losses before reporting them. Pro forma financial projections showed many companies facing debt squeezes.

### Dalio's Warning (July 26, 2007)

**(BDO) July 26: Is This the Big One?**

- Crazy lending and leveraging creating pervasive fragility
- Interest rates will rise until financial system cracks
- Everything will reverse: move from greed to fear, volatilities increase, carry and credit spreads blow out
- No idea exactly when this will occur or if current situation is "the big one"
- Want to avoid/fade this lunacy
- **No one knows how financial market contagion will play out**

**Study of market player positions** (especially via derivatives markets):
- Read government/intermediary studies, gathered all available data, examined 10-K reports
- **Conclusion: no one has a clue—can only vaguely examine exposures one level deep**
- Easy to see some parties' exposures (regulated intermediaries), impossible to see who's carrying positions to ascertain net positions
- Dealers at epicenter know their counterparties but not counterparties' total positions
- **These exposures grown rapidly (~4x larger than five years ago), huge (~$400 trillion)**

### Fed's Complacency

Growth still looked good; debt and tightening hadn't yet passed through to economy (July 31). Fed extremely concerning in its sanguinity.

Fed statement (August 7): "Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy."

### August 2007: Serious Unraveling

- August 9: **BNP Paribas** (France's largest bank, one of world's largest) froze $2.2 billion in three funds due to US subprime exposure
- European banks nervous about lending to each other
- **European Central Bank (ECB)** injected 95 billion euros to get rates back to target, another 61 billion next day
- US saw squeeze in safe Treasury bills, higher yields on riskier commercial paper and interbank lending
- **Money market funds** (main holders of asset-backed commercial paper) saw asset value hits, required assistance from sponsors/banks/fund families to avoid "breaking the buck"

**TED spread** (interbank stress measure) spiked—clear signal the top of debt cycle was being made.

**(BDO) August 10: This Is the Big One**

- Financial market unraveling we've been expecting
- Unwinding of widely held, irresponsibly created positions from financial middlemen investing immense liquidity flooding system
- Like 1998 or 1994, just bigger
- Less certain about specifics than what we don't know—how cards will fall depends on who's holding what and how they knock on with each other
- Despite extensive work mapping this over two years, couldn't map to worthwhile extent—knowledge of positions too imprecise, array of permutations too wide
- **Forecasting weeks ahead like predicting hurricane's course two weeks ahead**
- Confident regulators (with best windows) also can't forecast reliably, reacting to events
- Seen this self-reinforcing dynamic before (1998 most recent)
- Will run through system with hurricane speed (next 4-6 months), leaving weaker credits dead/damaged, stronger ones in catbird seat

**"Depression gauge"**: simple algorithm based on proximity of interest rates to 0%, debt vulnerability measures, beginning of debt deleveraging. Used to trigger portfolio/risk control changes including counterparty risks.

### Countrywide Crisis

Week later: **Countrywide** (US's largest mortgage issuer) exhausted credit line, at risk of bankruptcy. Notable canary in coal mine but not systemically critical.

Central banks responded with liquidity. Fed surprisingly cut rates 0.5% between regular meetings (unusual move). **Bernanke** said he'd do more if needed. **Bank of America** invested $2 billion in Countrywide for large stake. Moves alleviated funding strains; equities recovered. Stock market still near highs.

### Policy Makers' View

Most thought risky mortgage market problems would be contained—flow-through to real economy wouldn't be substantial. Dalio saw differently: "day of reckoning will be pushed forward, probably to when there is a big tightening by Fed or big turndown in economy."

### Why Investors Were Misled: VAR Problem

**Value at Risk (VAR)** = measure of recent volatility in markets/portfolios, commonly used to determine likely magnitude and occurrence of losses

- Uses recent volatility as main input for position sizing
- Simplified example: investor never wants to lose more than 20%. If subprime mortgage's worst monthly loss ever was 5%, models might say "safe" to borrow until they own 3x leveraged subprime

> **Investors looked at recent volatility in their VAR calculations, and by and large expected it to continue moving forward. This is human nature and it was dumb because past volatility and past correlations aren't reliable forecasts of future risks.**

Very profitable approach—clients urged Dalio to increase positions because VAR was low. Dalio refused.

**Extrapolating current conditions forward = bad approach vs. considering true range of possibilities**. Should bet on opposite of what happened lately.


<!-- pp. 401-420 -->

### VAR and Leverage Dynamics

- **Low volatility and benign VAR estimates encourage increased leverage** — at the time, some leverage ratios neared 100:1
- Leverage is a better indicator of future volatility than VAR itself
- In 2007, banks and investors heavily exposed to subprime mortgages — instruments had not experienced a loss cycle or much volatility
- **VAR was self-reinforcing on the downside**: increased market volatility at 2008 crisis peak made statistical riskiness look even higher, triggering more selling

## The Fall of 2007

### Policy Responses to Mortgage Crisis

- Fall 2006: **Paulson** and Treasury began working with **Barney Frank** and House Financial Services Committee to reform **Fannie and Freddie**
  - Focus: curbing excesses, increasing regulator authority
  - Bill passed House spring 2007, stalled in Senate
- No federal funding available to modify mortgages for struggling homeowners due to political opposition
- Bush Treasury worked with lenders, mortgage servicers, counselors to motivate private modifications with "modest but meaningful success"
- Treasury and Fed jointly developed "break the glass" option — authority to purchase illiquid mortgage securities if politically feasible
  - This became forerunner of **TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)**

### Fed's Monetary Policy Considerations

- Fed signaled willingness to ease monetary policy to mitigate spillover effects from mortgage stress
- Most market participants believed policy makers could manage the crisis smoothly despite deteriorating fundamentals
- **Bernanke** pushed "blue-sky thinking" (unrestricted brainstorming) with **Hank Paulson** and Treasury staff
  - **As financial contagion spreads beyond banking sector, increasing numbers in real economy lose credit access through usual channels**
  - **Bernanke considered Fed lending directly to broader range of counterparties beyond depository institutions**
  - Found authority in **Section 13(3) of Federal Reserve Act** — unused since Great Depression but still valid

> "Knowing which needed actions in a crisis are permitted (or not permitted) by law and how to have them approved is a classic challenge in democracies with rigid regulations and robust checks and balances systems."

### Rate Cut Debate: Two Tensions

1. **Inflation concerns**: Dollar weakening, oil prices rising — easing would contribute to dollar weakness, higher oil prices, higher inflation
2. **Moral hazard**: Problems stemmed from speculation — ameliorating speculators' problems would encourage excessive future risk-taking

### The Moral Hazard Question

> "How the 'moral hazard' question is dealt with during big debt crises is one of the biggest determinants of how these crises turn out."

- Natural to want those responsible to experience consequences and impose discipline
- **But analogy: putting someone on diet and treadmill after heart attack**
- **Above all else, most important thing is to provide life-blood (stimulants) to keep systemically important parts alive**
- Dangerous to be overly precise in balancing: (a) letting borrowers/lenders experience consequences vs. (b) providing judicious liquidity to rectify severity of contraction
- **Better to err on providing too much than too little**
- Unlike Great Depression (when Fed let banks fail en masse), Fed's priority was saving the economy while minimizing moral hazard when possible

**Tim Geithner** (NY Fed president) shared this view:
- Moral hazard framework = wrong way to think about crisis policy
- Policy must be aggressive in removing catastrophic risk; can't move slowly or precisely
- Providing liquidity during liquidity crisis leaves government open to less risk and leaves system healthier
- Paradox: if you let things burn, government ends up taking on all risk through costly nationalization

**Geithner's outcome data**: Instead of losing 5-10% of GDP on financial rescue, US earned ~2% of GDP — "dramatic outlier in history of financial crises" due to Fed and Treasury's aggressive response and willingness to set moral hazard concerns aside

### September 18, 2007 Rate Cut

- Fed cut rates 0.5% (vs. 0.25% market expectation)
- Bernanke: "the hawks and doves flocked together"
- Sparked "ecstatic" stock rally (*New York Times*) — S&P 500 returned to within 2% of all-time high
- **Message**: Fed willing to take decisive action to contain August turmoil
- **Reality**: **easing wouldn't solve fundamental problems — financial intermediaries, debtors, creditors holding more debt assets and liabilities than could be serviced**

### Bank Balance Sheet Problems

**Asset side**: banks owned subprime mortgages through securitizations

**Liability side**: banks dependent on risky short-term funding sources
- Historically relied on deposits (controllable with guarantees)
- **FDIC** (founded 1933) insured deposits, eliminating depositor flight incentives
- **Modern "short-term wholesale funding"** = uninsured deposits — depositors had big incentive to pull at first sign of trouble

### The Securitization Machine

> "At its heart, the securitization machine started with the issuance of risky mortgages and ended with the sale of very safe bonds to institutional investors."

- Mortgage lender makes loans → sells to bank → bank packages into bundles of 1,000 loans
- Diversification theory: combined cash flows safer than individual loans (one default wouldn't affect other 999 borrowers)
- Bank slices cash flows into tranches:
  - 70-80%: super-safe AAA-rated bonds
  - 10-15%: slightly riskier AA-rated bonds
  - 5-10%: BBB-rated bonds
  - Small unrated residual ("first-loss piece") absorbs first defaults

> "This was a classic case of data-mining history rather than using sound logic to assess risk. People were leveraging themselves up by betting that they were safe, because the thing they were betting against had never happened before."

- When bet went wrong, self-reinforcing upside dynamic shifted to self-reinforcing downside dynamic
- Banks retained first-loss piece, carried bonds as inventory
- Worked until it didn't — encouraged more of the same until demand dried up Q3 2007

### Fall 2007 Write-Downs

**Bear Stearns**: 3Q07 earnings dropped 61% (hedge fund losses, subprime exposure)
**Morgan Stanley & Lehman Brothers**: 7% and 3% earnings hits respectively
**Citigroup, UBS, Merrill Lynch**: meaningful but manageable losses
- **Citigroup's initial write-down**: $5.9 billion (note for comparison to later figures)

### Bridgewater's Loss Estimates (Fall 2007)

- Ran "stress tests" — gathered bank balance sheet data, applied liquid market prices to illiquid holdings
- Anticipated unreported losses before they materialized
- **October 9, 2007**: S&P 500 closed at all-time high — wouldn't be reached again until 2013

### Banks Propose Joint Fund (Abandoned)

- Major banks proposed $75-100 billion fund to buy distressed subprime securities
- Viewed as natural response to credit crunch, would help alleviate contagion risk
- By year end: effort abandoned — banks decided "not needed at this time"

### Crisis Spreads to Europe

**Two mechanisms**:

1. **Short-term wholesale funding reliance**: **Northern Rock** (British bank) relied on money markets → funding dried up summer 2007 → classic "run" (depositors lining up three straight days mid-September to withdraw)
   - UK deposit insurance cap: £35,000 (lower than US)
   - British government guaranteed all Northern Rock deposits

2. **Subprime securitization investments**: Large European banks (**UBS, Deutsche Bank**) owned stakes as corollary to producing securitizations; smaller banks wanted exposure to AAA-rated securities
   - **AAA subprime securities had 0% default rate** historically (S&L crisis 1980s, dot-com bubble early 2000s per **Standard & Poor's**)
   - Offered premium vs. corporate bonds of same rating (hindsight: premium far too small for risk)

- Bridgewater shifted exposures from riskier counterparties to safer ones, moved into safer assets

### Late October 2007: Sentiment Turns

- Predictions of overall subprime losses increasing
- **October 19**: US stocks fell 2.6% after **JPMorgan** $2 billion write-down and **Bank of America** weak earnings
- Losses becoming larger than expected for banks, but not yet clear how severely housing stress would hit US households (consumption ~70% of GDP)

#### (BDO) October 30: Falling Home Prices and Wealth

- Weakening housing affects economy multiple ways: falling construction, falling housing-related spending, less cash from mortgage borrowing for non-housing consumption, falling wealth
- Financing alone (money borrowed against houses) = over 3% at peak, will likely be negative soon
- Construction declining 20% annual pace → ~1% drag on real growth
- **Real estate assets peaked at 167% of GDP → drop in wealth will equal ~50% of GDP**

- Rising mortgage delinquencies, slowing home purchases, slowing retail sales
- ~2 million borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages scheduled for teaser rate expiration in 2008 → interest cost jumps
- **Paulson** announced mortgage modification measures but stopped short of taxpayer funding

### Bridgewater Special Report (November 21, 2007)

**"What We Think Will Be Contained & What We Think Won't Be Contained"**

**Will be contained**:
- Sub-prime/SIV problems will spread (contagion) but remain manageable, won't sink economy (though will weaken it)
- Size manageable, ownership dispersed, large demand from distressed security buyers given plentiful global liquidity
- Requires wise coordination of central banks, finance ministries, legislators, financial institutions

**Won't be contained**:
- **Larger, more threatening latent credit problems beneath surface** from: (a) enormous liquidity seeking investment, (b) investors reaching for higher returns via structured, levered, illiquid, risky investments
- Exposures grown exponentially, very large, based on imprudent strategies
- **Mark-to-market losses as of today: ~$420 billion globally, ~1% of global GDP**
- Expect much larger unrealized losses and write-downs to come

### Derivatives: The Unknown Risk

- Biggest unknown: how losses might ripple through derivative markets
- **Derivatives**: financial contracts whose value determined by underlying asset, rate, index, or event
- Not used for raising money — primarily for hedging risks and speculating on price changes
- Made through private contracts, unregulated, enormous, opaque

**Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives**:
- December 2000: Congress clarified OTC contracts between "sophisticated parties" exempt from futures/securities regulation
- Over next seven years, OTC market grew rapidly
- **June 2008**: notional value = **$672.6 trillion**

**Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**:
- Insurance-like: CDS issuer insures buyer against defaults from particular exposure (e.g., mortgage-backed securities)
- Buyers transfer default risk to CDS sellers
- **AIG** sold massive CDS "insurance" but kept very small reserves — didn't have capacity to pay out for large losses

### Policy Maker Reactivity vs. Proactivity

- Author shared concerns with Treasury and White House — thought picture implausible because unprecedented
- Policy makers more reactive than proactive (understandable — not in business of betting against consensus)
- Operate within political systems requiring broad consensus before action
- **Generally don't act decisively until crisis is on top of them**

### Year-End 2007 Market Snapshot

- S&P 500: down 6% from October peak, positive territory for year overall
- December's biggest sell-off: day Fed lowered rates 0.25% (less than 0.5% market expectation)
- Bond yields: declined sharply from ~5% (June pre-credit crunch) to ~4% (year end)
- Dollar index: down 8.6% for year
- Oil: up 55% to $96 (near all-time high)

## Depression: 2008

### January-February 2008

- Economic cracks appearing: poor manufacturing, retail sales, employment reports
- **Major write-downs**: **Citigroup** $22.2 billion, **Merrill Lynch** $14.1 billion
- **Ambac and MBIA** downgraded (bond insurers with ~$1 trillion guaranteed debt, big subprime exposure)
- Losses from market declines + mark-to-market accounting requirements
- January 20: S&P 500 down ~10%; global equity markets fell even more

**Bernanke to Federal Open Market Committee**:
> "We are facing, potentially, a broad crisis. We can no longer temporize. We have to address this...we have to try to get it under control. If we can't do that, then we are just going to lose control of the whole situation."

### Fed Emergency Action (January 22)

- Emergency meeting → cut rates **75 basis points (0.75%)** to 3.5%
  - Cited "weakening economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth"
- Week later: cut another **50 basis points**
  - Cited "considerable stress" in financial sector, "deepening contraction," tight credit for "businesses and households"
- **Largest calendar month decline in short rates since 1987**
- Senate passed **$160 billion stimulus package** (tax rebates for low/middle income households)

- Stocks bounced but failed to recoup losses by end of February
- Massive write-downs continued: **AIG** $11 billion, **UBS** $14 billion, **Credit Suisse** $2.8 billion
- Service sector growth and consumer confidence: 7- and 16-year lows
- UBS report: losses from mortgage-backed securities could total **$600 billion** in US financial system

### Bridgewater: Deleveraging vs. Recession (January 31)

**(BDO) January 31: The Really Big Picture; Not Just a Normal Recession**

- "R" (recession) misleading — connotes typical contraction like previous US recessions
- Different from Japan 1990s and US 1930s — better characterized as "D" (deleveraging)
- **"R"**: contraction in real GDP from tight central bank policy (fighting inflation), ends when central bank eases, managed via interest rate changes
- **"D"**: economic contraction from financial deleveraging → assets sold → asset prices decline → equity levels decline → more forced selling → credit contraction → economic contraction → worse cash flows → more asset sales in self-reinforcing cycle
- **Financial deleveraging causes financial crisis that causes economic crisis**

## March 2008—Rescuing Bear Stearns

### Early March Stress

- First 10 days: equities down ~4.5% (larger losses for financials)
- High-profile defaults: **Carlyle Capital** ($22 billion AUM), **Peloton Partners** (two London-based funds, $3 billion AUM), **Thornburg Mortgage** ($36 billion AUM) missing margin calls
- All heavily exposed to mortgage-backed securities, lenders increasingly hesitant

- Concerns spread to major brokerages with significant MBS exposure: **Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch**
- Borrowing costs spiked

> "The problems were passing to systemically important financial institutions, threatening the entire system. Even so, the danger was not widely appreciated."

- Bridgewater Daily Observations (March 10): conditions "slipping away," "Broker/dealers in our experience cannot survive with financing costs close to Bear's current levels"

### Bear Stearns Crisis

- Most stressed major investment bank
- Held $400 billion securities that would be dumped if it failed
- Nearly 400 subsidiaries touching almost every other major financial firm
- 5,000 trading counterparties, 750,000 open derivatives contracts
- **Bernanke**: "size alone wasn't the problem. Bear was big, but not that big compared to largest commercial banks." Not "too big to fail" but **"too interconnected to fail"**
- **Greatest fear**: Bear bankruptcy could trigger collapse in **$2.8 trillion tri-party repo market** (significant credit pipe for financial institutions) → "disastrous consequences for financial markets and, as credit froze and asset prices plunged, the entire economy"

> "Classically, when a financial institution starts to show early signs of stress, it can experience 'runs' that can accelerate into a failure in a matter of days, because runs can lead to losing liquidity."

- Institutions rely on short-term (often overnight) borrowing to hold longer-term illiquid assets
- At first sign of trouble, logical for short-term credit providers to stop lending to avoid losses
- As more participants change behavior this way → liquidity crisis → failure
- This was happening to institutions shown in chart (conveyed by spreads)
- Treasury and Fed had days to figure out responses

### Policy Maker Capabilities for Managing Debt Crises

> "If the debt is in one's own currency, and if policy makers have both the knowledge of what it takes to manage it and the authority to do so, then they are capable of handling these situations in a way that minimizes spill-over effects and limits economic pain (though some pain is inevitable)."

- Theme returns repeatedly throughout the book

### The 2008 US Economic Leadership Team

- US had team that understood debt crisis management as well as could be expected (once-in-a-lifetime magnitude)
- **Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson**: 30+ years financial market experience at Goldman Sachs (8 years as CEO) → understanding of how financial institutions/markets worked, forceful leadership style, experience making tough decisions under pressure
- **Chairman Bernanke**: one of most prominent economists, world's foremost Great Depression expert → critical perspective
- **Tim Geithner** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York president): leading role in overseeing biggest banks and implementing monetary policy; ~20 years economic policy experience including prominent roles at Treasury
<!-- pp. 421-440 -->

### Leadership Team During Crisis

- **Geithner, Paulson, and Bernanke** formed highly effective crisis team
- Trusted each other, had complementary skills, agreed on preventing systemically important failures
- Cooperation and cleverness prevented what could have been decades-long disaster

### Legal Authority Problem

**Critical constraint: lacked legal authority for necessary interventions**
- Treasury could only use funds designated by Congress
- Clear playbook existed for traditional banks (FDIC-administered), but no authority to provide capital to failing investment banks
- Required willing private sector buyer to save investment banks
- **Flexible authority is classic crisis challenge** — systems designed for stability in normal times poorly suited to crisis scenarios requiring immediate, aggressive action

### Bear Stearns Rescue (March 2008)

**Fed's intervention using section 13(3) powers** (unused since Great Depression):
- Announced **$200 billion Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)** allowing financial institutions to borrow cash/treasuries using risky assets (including nongovernment MBS) as collateral
- Markets applauded with ~4% stock gains (largest daily gain in 5+ years)

**Bear's liquidity crisis accelerated despite TSLF:**
- March 10-14: **$18 billion cash buffer disappeared** in 4 days as customers withdrew funds
- Paulson feared Bear could collapse within 24 hours
- Bear made loans up to 60 days while relying on overnight funding — extreme maturity mismatch
- Thursday, March 14: Repo market lenders refused even Treasury securities as collateral for Bear overnight loans

**Private sector solution was best option:**
- Another Fed loan wouldn't help — Bear needed equity to fill loss hole, not more debt
- Treasury lacked authority to be that investor
- **JPMorgan** was natural buyer: Bear's clearing bank, intermediary to repo lenders, most familiar with holdings
- Fed provided JPM **$30 billion non-recourse loan** to buy Bear at $2/share (peak was $173), secured by Bear's mortgage pool — future losses borne by Fed/taxpayer
- Created new lending facility where 20 investment banks/brokerages could borrow unlimited sums using MBS as collateral
- Fed cut rates 75 basis points to 2.25%

**Impact:**
- Stocks rallied, month ended flat
- Controversial to use taxpayer money, but alternative was "financial system passing point of no return"
- Markets rebounded but **Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner immediately worried about Lehman**

### Political Response to Bear Rescue

- Paulson and Bernanke met **Barney Frank** (House Financial Services Committee chairman) seeking emergency authority to wind down failing investment banks in panic
- Frank: impossible to get from Congress without compelling public case
- Paulson maintained frequent (unsuccessful) communication with Lehman CEO to convince him to sell or raise equity
- April meeting with Senators **Chris Dodd, Richard Shelby** and GSE CEOs **Daniel Mudd, Richard Syron** led to Senate taking up GSE reform legislation (stalled since May 2007)

## The Post-Rescue Rally: April–May 2008

**Market optimism through April-May:**
- Stocks rallied, bond yields rose
- Growing confidence Fed would do "whatever was necessary"
- Paulson noted economy rebounding, expected faster growth by year-end
- Charts showed temporary rally in stocks, declining Treasury yields, narrowing bank CDS spreads, but widening corporate spreads

### Underlying Deterioration Continued

**Balance sheet expansions slowing:**
- Unemployment climbing, consumer confidence/borrowing falling
- Housing delinquencies and foreclosures rising
- Manufacturing and services activity contracting
- Fresh write-downs: UBS ($19B), Deutsche Bank ($4B), MBIA ($2.4B), AIG ($7.8B)

> "We likened it to a 'currency intervention that temporarily reverses the markets but doesn't change the underlying conditions that necessitated the action.'" — Dalio's Daily Observations

**Simultaneous pressures:**
- Oil hit $130 in late May
- Dollar continued falling
- Fed faced dilemma balancing accommodative policy (economic contraction) vs. price stability concerns
- April Fed minutes: "difficulty gauging appropriate stance of policy in current circumstances"
- Two members expressed "substantial concerns about prospects for inflation"

**Inefficiency of broad monetary policy for sectoral debt problems:**
- Using interest rate/liquidity policies affecting whole economy to address specific sector debt problems "very inefficient at best"
- Macroprudential policies more appropriate (should've been used in 2007 to control emerging bubbles)
- Only deployed much later when circumstances forced their use
- When Fed cut rates late April, markets priced it as end of easing cycle

## Summer of 2008: Stagflation

**June: simultaneous shocks**
- S&P fell 9% due to surging oil prices spiking inflation
- Renewed credit problems in financial sector, poor economic stats

**Credit problems intensified:**
- Downgrades of **Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley** by S&P (lost confidence in ability to meet obligations)
- Rumors Lehman approached Fed for emergency funding
- Moody's: **MBIA and Ambac** (two largest bond insurers) likely to lose AAA ratings, severely impairing ability to write new insurance
- Moody's cut insurers' ratings, placed Lehman on credit review
- Home foreclosures and mortgage delinquency rates (underlying drivers) continued accelerating

**Balance sheet analysis revealed systemic danger:**
- Estimated losses, reduced capital from those losses, impact on lending/asset sales showed institutions "headed for serious trouble with serious knock-on effects"
- Getting margin calls meant raising capital or selling assets and contracting lending — bad for markets and economy

**Economic deterioration:**
- Unemployment surged to 5.6% (largest monthly increase in two decades)
- Manufacturing activity declined fourth month in row
- Consumer confidence hit 16-year low
- Headline inflation rose to 4.4% in May (sharpest 6-month increase)
- **Stagflation fears** amidst poor growth and rising inflation expectations

### Policy Dilemma: Ease or Not Ease?

**Cross-currents made answer unclear:**
- Policy makers concerned about both economic growth and price stability
- Bernanke called rising oil prices unwelcome; Paulson emphasized "real headwind" for economy
- Bernanke: Fed would "carefully monitor" exchange rate implications for inflation/expectations
- Paulson suggested he "would never take intervention off the table"

**Fed priority shift from preventing debt/economic risks toward assuring price stability:**
- June 4: Bernanke noted further rate cuts unlikely due to inflation concerns, current policy rate sufficient for moderate growth
- June 25: Fed left rates unchanged noting "although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased"

**Markets continued declining through July:**
- Oil prices rose, ratings downgrades, write-downs, poor housing stats
- Financial stocks in free fall as became clear Fed behind developments, credit problems wouldn't be fixed by easy policy
- Mortgage crisis and who it would affect next became clearer

### Fannie and Freddie Crisis Emerges (July 2008)

**Lehman report (July 7) triggered investor stampede:**
- Stated **Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae** would need **$75 billion capital infusion** to remain solvent
- Shares declined ~45% each in week following report

**Mid-July interventions:**
- Oil prices declined sharply (giving Fed room to ease)
- SEC placed restrictions on shorting 19 financial stocks (including Fannie/Freddie)
- Fed extended emergency lending for investment banks/brokerages
- **Treasury and Fed announced Fannie/Freddie could tap public funding (bailout) if on verge of collapse**

## Taking Control of Fannie and Freddie

### GSE Background and Structure

**Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac** were government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs):
- Created by Congress in 1938 and 1970 respectively
- Fannie part of Roosevelt's New Deal post-Great Depression
- Mission: stabilize US mortgage market, promote affordable housing
- Mechanism: buy mortgages from approved private lenders, package together, guarantee timely payment, sell back to investors

**Everyone appeared to benefit:**
- Private lenders: ready buyer for mortgages
- Fannie/Freddie: profited from buying risky mortgages and turning them safe (buy cheap, sell for more)
- Banks/investors: greater supply of safe assets earning slightly more than treasury bonds
- Households: cheaper borrowing rates

**Based on implicit government guarantee:**
- Not officially guaranteed by law; government officials denied guarantee for years
- Private market believed government would never let GSEs fail (would hurt too many including homeowners)
- Couldn't be 100% sure because Treasury wouldn't make assurance
- Implicit guarantee allowed securities issued by GSEs to be seen as safe as treasuries
- Spread on their debt to treasuries sometimes hit 0%

### Growth and Risk Accumulation

**Perverse incentives from implicit guarantee:**
- Larger GSEs grew, more "systemically important" they became
- Being systemically important virtually guaranteed government rescue, making them safer, fueling more growth
- **Government guarantees (implicit or explicit) make risky assets appear safer, encouraging investors to lever up, feeding bad debt growth**

**By 2007:**
- Twenty times larger than Bear Stearns
- Owned or guaranteed **$5 trillion** in residential mortgages and MBS — about half of US total
- $1.7 trillion debt outstanding, ~20% held by international investors
- Huge players in short-term lending market, frequently borrowing up to $20 billion weekly
- "Disaster waiting to happen" — only question was what government would do

### Political Power and Regulatory Capture

**Larry Summers** described 1990s challenges dealing with Fannie/Freddie:

> "Fannie and Freddie had vast political power. When we said anything raising concern about them, they had arranged for the Treasury to receive 40,000 pieces of mail saying it is important that Fannie and Freddie be fully enabled to do their vital work. When we testified on Fannie and Freddie, a congressman would pull out an envelope from Fannie with their prepared statements and what their questions were going to be. They would have a set of mayors call if you tried to mess with them. The most disillusioning experience I had with respect to the financial community was at the quarterly dinner for the Treasury Advisory Borrowing Committee. I asked them: 'What do you guys think about the GSEs?' They said that the GSEs were like a massively over-leveraged hedge fund—dangerous. They were pretty emphatic. I said, 'Would you put that in your report?' and they said they would. The report came back basically saying that Fannie and Freddie are vital contributors to our financial systems. I asked what happened. They said that they checked with their bosses and their bosses said we couldn't say that because we all had such important client relationships."

**Paulson on systemic risk:**

> "We had seen what happened in March when Bear Stearns's counterparties...abruptly turned away. We had survived that, but the collapse of Fannie and Freddie would be catastrophic. Seemingly everyone in the world—little banks, big banks, foreign central banks, money market funds—[either] owned their paper or were [their] counterparty. Investors would lose tens of billions; foreigners would lose confidence in the US. It might cause a run on the dollar."

### Treasury Takeover (July-September 2008)

**Equity collapse by July 15:**
- Freddie/Fannie equity prices declined almost 75% in less than a year

**July 23: Congress granted unprecedented authority:**
- Treasury could use "unspecified" (virtually unlimited) amount to provide funds to GSEs (limited only by federal debt ceiling)
- Expanded regulatory oversight
- Treasury acquired "blank check, backstopped by taxpayer, to do whatever it took to keep these institutions solvent"

**Nationalizing too-big-to-fail financial institutions on brink of failure is classic deleveraging move:**
- Usually well-received
- Signifies government willing to provide blanket of safety over system
- When debts denominated in country's own currency, government has power to eliminate default risks

**Trade-off of checks and balances:**
- Undeniable advantages to political environment with checks and balances and laws
- **During crisis, risk that necessary actions might not be done swiftly enough**
- Laws never written perfectly to anticipate/specify how to handle every possible circumstance
- 2008 crisis had numerous close calls requiring getting around rules to do what needed to be done

### Assessment and Conservatorship (July 30-September 7)

**July 30-August assessment:**
- Treasury regulators (with Fed and outside accounting specialists) pored over GSE books
- Discovered both companies papering over massive capital losses
- After properly accounting for questionable intangible assets and improperly valued mortgage guarantees, both companies **tens of billions underwater**
- Paulson: "We'd been prepared for bad news, but the extent of the problems was startling"

**Plan development (mid-August to September 7):**
- Treasury built plan serving economic goals without bumping against legal constraints
- Decided to put GSEs into **conservatorship** while injecting capital through guaranteed preferred stock purchases
- Conservatorship: both companies could keep running relatively normally post-takeover
- Guaranteed stock purchases: Treasury could effectively backstop their debt even after 18-month authority limit expired
- Paulson wouldn't have to give Fannie/Freddie any heads up — only needed go-ahead from direct regulator, **Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)**

**Political vs. economic challenge:**
- More political than economic challenge
- GSE executives still believed they were on sound footing
- FHFA had sent GSEs draft reports concluding sufficient capitalization just weeks before
- If takeover news leaked, executives could mobilize lobbyists/congressional allies to fight
- No guarantee Treasury would win — GSEs "famously the toughest streetfighters in town"

**Coordination to convince FHFA (September 4-5):**
- Required combined influence of Treasury, Fed, OCC, FDIC
- FHFA (which repeatedly blessed Fannie/Freddie books on loose statutory accounting rules) embarrassed at thought of reversing suddenly
- After weeks of pressure from Treasury/allies, FHFA examiners gave in September 4
- September 5: news given to boards of two companies
- Fearing friction/delay might send markets plunging, Paulson set out to "ambush Freddie and Fannie" with no advance warning

### Paulson's Explanation of Strategy

**July 2008 situation:**
- Fannie/Freddie beginning to fail
- Treasury asked for very expansive emergency powers
- Combined, nine times larger than Lehman Brothers, dominant sources of mortgage financing during crisis
- Could not be allowed to fail

**Political constraint:**
- Political advisors told Paulson if they put big dollar number in front of Congress for approval, Congress would likely get spooked
- Couldn't ask for unlimited authority to inject capital
- Decided to ask for "unspecified" authority

**Temporal challenge:**
- Authority temporary (expired October 2009)
- Fannie/Freddie had long-term debt and insured long-term mortgages
- Required creative financial engineering to turn temporary authority into de facto long-term guarantee
- Used ability to immediately issue long-term preferred stock, then used preferred shares to backstop Fannie/Freddie and absorb potential losses

**Unprecedented political maneuvering:**
- Legal finagling required convincing lawmakers to set aside ideological opposition to bailouts while getting Congress to raise debt ceiling for potentially meaningful capital injection
- Paulson: "if Congress failed to come through, markets would implode. The stakes were enormous"

**August relief period:**
- Falling oil prices and Treasury's unprecedented intervention helped usher relief interval
- Equities rallying modestly through August (~2%), financials down only 1%, free fall of Freddie/Fannie stock halted
- Despite growing perception financial markets stabilizing, underlying drivers of credit problems and feedback into real economy unchanged

**Dalio's warning (August 18):**

> **(BDO) August 18: Entering the Second Stage of the Deleveraging**
>
> It seems to me that we have been through much of the first stage and are now entering the second stage (i.e., the avalanche stage) of the deleveraging. While the Fed did a great job of providing liquidity where it reasonably could, the accounting adjustments (e.g., allowing losses to be written down over several years) weren't made, so **we are approaching a solvency crisis that we think is about to result in an avalanche of asset sales.** So now the question is whether they will create a safety net in time to catch these assets so that they don't crash and bring down the financial system and the economy with it. Frankly, we think that this will be a race to the wire.

## The Crash: September 2008

In September the crisis entered new stage with genuine risk world economy would plunge into depression. Transition into nearly day-by-day account of events.

**First week of September: mixed signals**
- Oil prices falling precipitously (reduced inflation concern, provided tailwind to US consumer spending)
- Airlines and retailers hopeful of pickup in consumer spending were particular beneficiaries
- Falling oil prices also reflected weakening global growth

**Financial players struggling but solutions appearing in works:**
- Lehman's stock rose on news of progress negotiating sale to Korea Development Bank
- Freddie successful $4 billion debt sale
- Ambac announced launch of new insurance subsidiary
- Partially softened investor concerns

<!-- pp. 441-460 -->

## Lehman Goes Bankrupt: September 8-15

### Early Week: Fannie/Freddie Nationalization

- Week began with positive developments: **Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac** nationalized over weekend
- Markets initially rose ~2% Monday, Sept 8 — optimism that nationalization "marked a possible turning point"
- **New York Times** suggested government action had "averted a calamity"
- But negative economic data continued: jobless claims spiked, unemployment rose 5.7% to 6.1%, stocks fell 2.5%
- Global slowdown evident from Canada to Australia

### The Lehman Dilemma

- **Lehman Brothers** trading down 80% but seemed potentially salvageable with its 160-year history
- **Hindsight vs. real-time perception**: In moment, rallies suggested "bargain hunters" saw bottom forming
- **NYT** wrote repeatedly (Sept 3, 5, 10) about potential buyers, market down ~20% from peak
- "In investing, it's at least as important to know when not to be confident and when not to make a bet as it is to have an opinion and make one"

### Tuesday Collapse

- No strategic investor materialized — Lehman stock fell almost 50% Tuesday
- Major banks (**Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill**) sold off 5-10%, overall market down 3%
- **Credit spreads** widened substantially
- Both investors and regulators questioned whether Lehman could survive the weekend

### Legal Constraints on Saving Lehman

- **No clear legal path** to save failing investment banks, yet they were "systemically important"
- Fed could lend to Lehman for **liquidity**, but Lehman faced **solvency problem**
- **Key principle**: "A solvency problem can only be dealt with by providing more equity capital (or changing the accounting/regulatory rules)"
- Neither Fed nor Treasury had authority to provide equity
- Needed private investor/buyer like **Bear Stearns had with JPMorgan**
- Finding buyer harder: Lehman bigger, more complicated, murkier losing positions

### Failed Rescue Attempts

- **Merrill Lynch** also in dire straits — without investor "no more than a week away from bankruptcy"
- Thursday: Lehman shares dropped 42% on rumors **Barclays** and **Bank of America** wouldn't buy without government help
- Lehman rolling **$200 billion in overnight loans** just to operate — huge pullback risk
- Friday: Shares fell 17% on news Fed/Treasury wouldn't backstop any deal
- Lehman's failure would create domino effect hitting **AIG** (stock fell 31%)
- Overall market closed Friday up 0.4% (aided by falling oil) — most still believed problems would be contained

### Weekend Crisis Meetings

- Friday evening: Fed gathered heads of major Wall Street banks (**Goldman Sachs to Bank of New York Mellon**) to urge Lehman bailout
- **Bank of America, Barclays, HSBC** expressed interest but none wanted to proceed without government support
- Treasury publicly insisted no support would come
- **Paulson** hoped consortium of banks could take Lehman's bad loans to facilitate acquisition
- Some consortium progress made, but no buyer emerged
- Without buyer, Fed lacked authorities "effective in preventing the failure of a nonbank in the midst of a panic-driven run"

### Bernanke and Geithner's Constraints

- **Bernanke and Geithner** had many conversations with Paulson about preventing Lehman failure
- Didn't believe Fed loan would be effective (as with Bear Stearns)
- Legal requirement that loan be "secured to their satisfaction" limited lending amount
- Couldn't lend Lehman enough to save it or guarantee its trading book
- Weeks consumed trying to prevent failure within legal bounds
- Willing to be "very creative" and "take a lot of risk" but only within what law allowed
- **Section 13(3)** of Federal Reserve Act allowed emergency lending to wider borrowers but "did not make them alchemists"
- "Loans were not equity, and they had to be guided by what would work in practice"

### Political and Legal Constraints

- Most agree it would have been better if policymakers had authority to liquidate Lehman orderly
- "Classic example of how political constraints together with imperfectly thought-out legal constraints can get in the way of actions that are widely agreed to be beneficial"

### Sunday: Bankruptcy Announcement

- Sunday afternoon: News broke Lehman headed for bankruptcy — "all hell broke loose"
- Shock unprecedented due to **Lehman's size and interconnectedness**
- Government's failure to save it raised doubts about ability to save the system
- **"Lehman's failure was particularly scary because of its large and poorly understood interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system"**

### Lehman's Derivatives Exposure

- Major channel of contagion: **Lehman's substantial presence in derivatives markets**
- Party to **$4-6 trillion in CDS exposure** (~8% of total market)
- Many exposures offsetting — net exposure much smaller — but failure sent clients scrambling for new counterparties
- No one knew Lehman's net exposure size or who was on other side
- "We were crossing the line into a big, disastrous unknown"

> "The uncertainty of this situation is tremendous. What happens when you go to settle a currency forward transaction with a counterparty that suddenly doesn't exist? Maybe everything goes fine, but maybe some unexpected condition bites you in the ass. What if you haven't been collecting mark-to-market gains from one of your dealers (we collect constantly from everyone), they go down, and now you are a general creditor? Who do you transfer the risk to? Maybe Merrill is right behind Lehman. What do you about that? And who might be behind it? If everyone is asking these questions the natural path is to cut back on trading and concentrate positions with a few firms. But these few firms have the incentive to ration their capacity to the highest quality financial institutions and managers. The inevitable result is substantially lower liquidity, higher transactions cost, and higher volatility. Higher volatility then feeds back into the real economy because people and businesses transact at these prices. And capital constraints in the financial sector mean that credit growth remains low, which undermines economic growth. We are getting very close to crossing this line." — **Daily Observations**, Sept 11

### The "Avalanche" Begins

- Lehman bankruptcy largest in US history (still is) — **$600 billion in assets**
- Only 2/3 size of **Goldman Sachs**, 1/4 as large as **JPMorgan**
- All connected, losses and liquidity problems spreading fast
- **"We called this stage of the crisis the 'avalanche'—the point at which a smaller problem in one corner of the financial system (subprime mortgages) was building in self-reinforcing ways into much bigger problems, and fast"**

## Aftermath of the Lehman Collapse: September 15-18

### Monday September 15: Markets Crater

- Lehman filed for bankruptcy Monday morning
- Stock market fell nearly 5%, no industry spared
- Financial sector took "brunt of the pain" — banks and insurers falling ~10%
- **Credit spreads blew out**, credit flow ground to halt
- Week spent figuring out Lehman ripple effects — interrelationships and exposures too complex and opaque
- **"It was clear to us that blanket protections would have to be put into place, because the consequences of the uncertainties themselves would be devastating as everyone ran from any entity that could go under. But if policy makers couldn't or wouldn't save Lehman Brothers, how could they save the system?"**

### Fed's Emergency Response: Primary Dealer Credit Facility Expansion

- Fed announced night before: unprecedented expansion of **"Primary Dealer Credit Facility"**
- Willing to lend to investment banks against almost any collateral: equities, subprime mortgages, junk bonds
- "Should have been seen as an enormous step for a central bank to take, and in a more normal environment, it would have been"
- Lehman collapse overshadowed it

### Communication Challenge

- **Paulson** later wrote he felt constrained from even explaining why Lehman failed without creating more problems
- Common issue policymakers face during crisis communication
- Per Paulson: "I was in a painful bind that I all too frequently found myself in as a public official. Although it's my nature to be forthright, it was important to convey a sense of resolution and confidence to calm the markets and to help Americans make sense of things... I did not want to suggest that we were powerless. I could not say, for example, that we did not have the statutory authority to save Lehman—even though it was true. Say that and it would be the end of Morgan Stanley, which was in far superior financial shape to Lehman but was already under an assault that would dramatically intensify in the coming days. Lose Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs would be next in line—if they fell, the financial system might vaporize and with it, the economy"

### Bridgewater's Client Note (Sept 15)

**"(BDO) September 15: Where We Are Now"**

- Financial institution losses known for some time, discussed repeatedly over past year
- Described as "known and manageable" via sensible government policies
- Liquidity (Fed), accounting rule changes, safety net (Treasury + Congress), clear policy articulation needed
- Recent Treasury/Fed moves made some things clear through action
- "Willing to take the chance of diving into the depths of the scary unknown without a clear safety net in place"
- **"So, now we sit and wait to see if they have some hidden trick up their sleeves or if they really are as reckless as they seem"**
- Interest rates heading toward 0%, financial intermediaries broken, deleveraging underway
- **"It appears that we are headed into a new domain in which the classic monetary tools won't work and the Japan in the 1990s and US in the 1930's dynamic will drive things"**

### Real Economy Impact

- Fed report: industrial output down sharply in August
- **AIG** credit ratings downgraded, triggering additional collateral requirements
- **Hewlett Packard** announced cutting 25,000 jobs
- Financial crisis quickly spread globally — European and Asian central banks announced new liquidity measures

### Credit Markets Seize Up

- Financial players sorting through **counterparty risks** from Lehman's failure
- **Interbank lending seized up**, **Libor** settled at almost twice prior week's levels
- Contagion spreading to strongest institutions
- Blue-chip firms like **GE** admitted trouble borrowing in commercial paper market
- **Prime money market funds** started showing stress, high redemptions, losses
- By day's end, credit spreads on **Morgan Stanley** wider than Lehman's on Friday

### AIG Crisis Escalates

- **AIG** one of largest insurers, ~$1 trillion in assets at peak
- Had issued hundreds of billions in insurance contracts on bonds (**CDS and CDOs**)
- Required to pay out if bond faced losses
- Many insured bonds were repackaged subprime mortgages — **AIG exposed to staggering losses**
- Other institutions counting on these insurance contracts — **AIG systemically important**
- Heading toward failure fast — Sunday said needed **$40 billion**, Monday suggested **$85 billion**

### Tuesday September 16: Two Bold Fed Moves

**1. Kept Interest Rates Unchanged (Disappointing Markets)**

- Regularly scheduled meeting — Fed decided *not* to change rates when market expected cut
- Significant disappointment, hurt markets
- Even as market on verge of depression, Fed remained concerned about inflation
- Statement: "The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern"
- **Bernanke** later wrote "in retrospect, that decision was certainly a mistake"
- Caused partly by "substantial sentiment at the meeting in favor of holding our fire until we had a better sense of how the Lehman situation would play out"

**2. Provided $85 Billion Emergency Loan to AIG (Redefining Central Banking)**

- Deal drafted in rush Tuesday afternoon, Sept 16
- Tough terms: **11.5% floating interest rate**, **80% government ownership stake**
- AIG pledged nearly everything as collateral: insurance subsidiaries, financial services companies, real estate holdings (including ski resort)
- Loan worked because market believed AIG solvent (due to insurance subsidiaries' investment-grade ratings)
- Insurance subsidiaries as collateral critical to Fed's decision
- Unusually risky loan for Fed — collateral not as easy to value/sell as normal AAA securities
- Risk AIG could still fail despite Fed help
- **Geithner**: "Deciding to support AIG was one of the most difficult choices I have ever been involved in in over 20 years of public service"

### Wednesday September 17: Markets Reject AIG Bailout

- AIG bailout didn't lift markets Wednesday
- Stocks slid 4.7%, major financial institutions down double digits
- Commercial paper rates continued rising
- Three-month treasury bills fell to just above 0% (from ~1.6% week before) as investors fled to safety
- Regulators announced stabilizing measures:
  - **SEC** tightened controls over short sellers
  - Bank regulators proposed accounting rule revisions to help bank balance sheets

### Mark-to-Market Accounting Explained

- Some bank assets **"marked-to-market"** — valued daily at potential sale prices
- Other assets valued differently, often by in-house methodology
- When required mark-to-market assets sell at fire-sale prices, banks appear to take significant losses
- Reduces capital, requires raising money or selling assets
- Further strains liquidity, puts downward pressure on assets, scares counterparties
- Accounting changes allowing banks to realize losses over longer time period (not marking to market) prevents some problems
- But changing accounting rules to hide losses during crisis doesn't engender confidence either
- Regulators must be careful

### Recapitalization Needs

- Accounting changes wouldn't solve fundamental issue: **overindebted US households and financial institutions defaulting because overleveraged**
- Financial institutions needed recapitalization (equity investment)
- Needed to find buyers for troubled assets
- **Paulson** turned to Congress for funding and authorization for Treasury to play that role

## The Government Comes Up with a Bailout Fund: September 18-31

### The TARP Proposal

- **Paulson, Bernanke**, and congressional leaders (especially **Barney Frank**) thought best way to restore confidence: buy troubled assets through **Troubled Asset Relief Program**
- Could have nationalized banks, but no US precedent
- When banks nationalized in other countries, penalized with harsh terms
- Banks reluctant to accept capital/nationalization until just before or after failure
- Paulson didn't believe this was the way to go — would be more damaging than helpful to reviving capital flows

### Why Buy Assets Instead of Nationalizing

- Big source of banks' problems: large amounts of complex, highly illiquid mortgage securities on balance sheets
- Theory: if government provided market for them, prices would rise, capital freed up, confidence restored
- Banking system could begin to recapitalize

### Thursday-Friday Rally

- When Wall Street learned about possible TARP plan Thursday, market rose
- Rally continued Friday — stocks up 4% as more details emerged
- **President Bush** and **Secretary Paulson** announced federal government prepared to spend **$500 billion** to buy troubled mortgages
- Congressional leaders promised quick action
- Fed unveiled **$180 billion in new swap lines for global central banks** — easing dollar liquidity crunch fears
- **SEC** instituted ban on short-selling nearly 800 financial stocks
- **Goldman Sachs** and **Morgan Stanley** came under government legal authority to provide blanket protection by voluntarily becoming bank holding companies

### Money Market Fund Guarantee

- **Treasury unveiled creative new move to shore up troubled money market funds holding $3.5 trillion**
- Money market funds very popular alternative to bank deposits for retail and institutional investors
- Attracted by high interest rates, undeterred by lack of FDIC protection
- Didn't appreciate delivering higher rates by investing in higher-yielding, higher-risk loans
- Believed wouldn't lose money as principal protected

### Money Market Funds as Liquidity Source

- **Prime money-market funds** crucial liquidity source for businesses
- Buy **commercial paper** — short-term debt businesses use to fund operations
- Commercial paper generally diversified and highly rated — funds usually considered almost riskless (like CDs or bank deposits)
- Few prime funds took losses when Lehman failed, specifically **Reserve Primary Fund** "broke the buck" Sept 16
- Fears others might take losses caused many investors to pull money
- As dollars flowed out, funds had to liquidate commercial paper holdings
- Result: **hundreds of billions of dollars funding day-to-day business operations dried up in days**

### Morning Crisis Calls (Sept 19)

- After Reserve Fund broke buck, **Ken Wilson** (Treasury) got 7am call from **Northern Trust**
- Followed by calls from **Black Rock, State Street, Bank of New York Mellon**
- All reported runs on money-market funds
- **GE** in news explaining couldn't sell paper
- **Coca-Cola CFO Muhtar Kent** called — unable to make $800 million quarterly dividend payment because couldn't roll paper
- AAA-rated industrial and consumer-products companies couldn't roll paper
- "Situation was very quickly metastasizing from Wall Street to Main Street"

### Treasury's Money Market Guarantee Solution

- To stop run, Paulson decided to guarantee money market funds outright
- Problem: funds would need substantial backstop, Treasury couldn't immediately find cash
- Creative solution: tapping **$50 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)** to back guarantee
- Plan announced Friday, Sept 19 — four days after Lehman collapse
- Treasury Secretaries can get in big trouble spending money that hasn't been appropriated
- Paulson got general counsel opinion he could use $45 billion "since if the whole economy went down it wouldn't be good for the dollar"
- Some colleagues questioned if $45 billion enough given $3.5 trillion money-market funds
- Paulson didn't know, but didn't have better idea

### FDIC Head's Complaint and Solution

- Treasury team moving so fast **Sheila Bair** (FDIC head) called and complained
- Not only wasn't she consulted, but guarantee would shift money from bank deposits to Money-Market Funds
- Good point — Treasury clarified guarantee only applicable to money-market funds in trouble as of Sept 19
- Guarantee worked incredibly well, markets immediately turned
- Per Paulson: when you say something is a guarantee (not just backstop), "much more reassuring to investors"

### ESF Creativity

- ESF meant to defend dollar against runs, but mandate flexible enough to divert to more pressing uses
- Could be done quickly with only presidential approval
- **"This was exactly the kind of quick thinking and creativity that was required to navigate the regulatory and political minefield and get what was needed done"**

### Optimistic Daily Observations (Sept 18)

**"(BDO) September 18: Great Moves!"**

- "The Treasury, Fed, and Congress finally agreed to agree to build the safety net!!!!"
- "Overnight central banks added $180 billion in liquidity!"
- "Regulators moved against short sellers"
- "Morgan Stanley was frozen and is about to be dealt with, and Goldman isn't far behind, but moves are in the works to deal with them"

### Weekend Optimism Fades

- Week's optimism faded as TARP details failed to emerge over weekend
- Formal proposal Saturday, Sept 20: three pages long
- Intended as outline rather than fait accompli to Congress
- Proposal called **TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)** — **$700 billion** in mortgage-related asset purchases
- Offered few details on administration or other actions
- Amount "a pittance in comparison to the need"
- Per client explanation when bill unveiled: troubled asset purchases couldn't have much impact on their own

### Bridgewater's Skeptical Assessment (Sept 25)

**"(BDO) September 25: The Proposed Plan Disappoints:"**

- Buying $700 billion in mortgages (plus some other assets) "will hardly help us at all"
- If bought at market prices: won't change financial conditions materially, mortgages small percentage of amount needed, won't deal with most existing problems
- If bought at premium: "unethical direct subsidy that is on the wrong side of the line," amount spent will buy less and still won't contain problems

### Congressional Resistance

- Legislators put off by unchecked authority bill would give Treasury
- Getting through Congress wasn't assured
- Monday markets opened: stocks sold off, closing down 3.8%
- Dollar fell against most major currencies

### Week of September 22: Political Struggle

- TARP bill's difficult journey through Washington DC set against backdrop of poor economic releases and icy credit markets
- Political struggles between those wanting to provide support vs. those who didn't drove markets Monday-Wednesday
- **Bernanke** and **Paulson** urged immediate action in Congressional testimony Tuesday
- **President Bush** addressed nation supporting TARP Wednesday
- Little apparent progress from Congress
- Legislative momentum interrupted by debates over:
  - More comprehensive bill with more homeowner aid
  - Better-defined limits on Treasury authority
  - Executive compensation at banks became hot-button issue
  - Many other issues causing arguing, little progress

### Populist Overtones

- **"As is classic in deleveraging scenarios, this political debate took on populist overtones"**
- Congressional leaders mostly supported, rank-and-file argued like handout to banks causing trouble
- Arguing over who bears costs typical during deleveragings, highly counterproductive
- "Can be like doctors in the emergency ward arguing over who will pay the bill"
- "All attention needs to be directed to saving the patient—how the costs should be handled can be decided later"

### Risks of Proposing TARP

- Even proposing TARP risky — if didn't pass, likely extremely negative market reaction
- Needed it passed in very difficult circumstances:
  - As soon as possible
  - Weeks before presidential election
  - Amid populist uproar from left and right over unprecedented size and scope
- Bill would need bipartisan passage (by this point extremely rare for any new important law, even rarer since)
- If either presidential candidate opposed, nearly impossible to pass
- **McCain** and **Palin** initially anti-bailout position put bill at risk (eventually supported)
- Paulson on phone almost daily with both candidates
- Only factor working in bill's favor: usually takes crisis to get Congress to act
- Financial crisis in most acute stage
- "Difficulties in getting TARP passed are a good illustration of why regulators need broad emergency authorities versus needing to rely on Congress to act"

### Market Turmoil Continues

- Financial markets pulsated between "they will" and "they won't" do what necessary in time
- **CDS spreads** on **Goldman Sachs** and **Morgan Stanley** (which narrowed after transforming to bank holding companies over weekend) widened through week
- Huge outflows from prime money-market funds into government funds continued pressuring commercial paper
- Thursday night: **FDIC** seized **Washington Mutual** — largest bank failure in American history
- Shifted assets to **JPMorgan** in $1.9 billion deal (would seize **Wachovia** days later)
- Friday Sept 26: "There is so much jam packed into each day that it is hard to pick what to comment on. The big picture through which we see all the daily news is that we are in the avalanche phase of the deleveraging"

### Sunday Breakthrough

- Political stalemate seemed to break early Sunday morning
- **Secretary Paulson**, flanked by **House Speaker Nancy Pelosi** and **Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid**, announced agreement reached on $700 billion bailout bill

### Monday Vote Fails

- When bill came up for vote Monday afternoon, it failed
- Stocks fell 8.8% — **largest single-day drop since 1987**
- Around world, reverberations sent markets spiraling downward
- Oil prices fell $10 because in depression demand would be much less
- Central banks scrambled to offer emergency loans to shell-shocked institutions
- **Interbank lending markets froze**, rates on short-term treasuries fell to just above zero

### Importance of Authority and Speed

- **"Again, among the most important aspects of successfully managing a crisis is having wise and knowledgeable decision-makers who have the authority to do whatever it takes"**
- Congressional vote was a


<!-- pp. 461-480 -->

### TARP Passage Politics and Implementation

#### The Credibility Crisis (Sept 29)

- **BDO September 29 note**: Treasury's struggle for authority signaled credibility test
- Global financiers (China, OPEC) would ultimately decide if US passed the test
- House failure to pass bailout bill shined "global spotlight on US decision makers"
- Even if passed, maintaining global faith would be difficult due to "chaotic process and lack of leadership"
- **Key warning**: "There is still a lot to lose"

#### Political Obstacles to TARP

- TARP considered just one month before "hotly contested presidential election"
- **Republicans**: Hated looking like they abandoned free-market principles and fiscal responsibility for bank bailout
- **Democrats**: Worried about giving legislative win to outgoing Republican administration before election
- **Obama and McCain**: Both worried opponent would gain populist credentials by opposing "Wall Street bailout"
- **Paulson's concern**: If either candidate took populist stand, bill would have "little chance of passing"

#### Bank Failures and European Contagion

- While Treasury worked with Congress, **WaMu and Wachovia** failed—two of biggest US bank failures in history
- Several European countries had to bail out their own banks
- Treasury officials recognized $700B in toxic asset purchases wouldn't be enough
- **But**: If money put directly into banks as capital, they could leverage and "buy many times the $700 billion"

#### Capital Injection Strategy

- Treasury pushed for authority to inject capital despite saying publicly they wouldn't
- **Key insight**: Rather than distinguish healthy from unhealthy banks (analytical nightmare, time-consuming, stigmatizing), Treasury offered to buy **preferred stocks on very attractive terms**
- This allowed capital injection into 700 banks very quickly
- **Dalio's defense**: Move was "enormously unpopular" but "necessary and appropriate"
- Prevented catastrophic collapse worse than Great Depression
- Taxpayers ultimately profited ~$50 billion from TARP capital programs
- **Dalio on leadership**: "This willingness to do the unpopular but right things to benefit people is both heroic and underappreciated"

> "Too many people who have never actually been on the field throw beer cans from the stands. This can lead to disastrous results, unless the players are smart enough and courageous enough to do what is right despite the unpopularity of doing it." — Ray Dalio

#### TARP Passage (Oct 3)

- TARP eventually passed—"extraordinary accomplishment" as rare, consequential bipartisan action
- **Pattern**: "Political systems typically make the right decisions only after heated fighting and literally just hours before disaster is about to strike"
- By time bill passed Oct 3, broad agreement among investors that bill "wouldn't be enough"
- Stocks sold off 1.4%

## October 2008

### Early October: Maximum Scramble

- First days of October = **"a scramble to get as much done in as short a time as possible"**
- Economy deteriorating daily, nearly every regulatory department had major policy change in works

#### FDIC Deposit Coverage Increase

- FDIC worked on raising deposit insurance ceiling
- Needed more coverage (Wachovia bank runs made clear) but worried raising limit too high would:
  - Draw depositors from foreign banks with lower limits
  - Choke off liquidity in Europe and Asia
- **Compromise**: Raised limit from $100K to $250K (Oct 3)
- Later added **Transaction Account Guarantee Program**—fully guaranteed non-interest bearing transaction accounts at participating banks

#### Economic Deterioration Data

- **First week of October alone**:
  - PMI (purchasing managers survey) well below expectations
  - Factory orders down 4% in August
  - Payroll report: lost 159,000 jobs in September—worst month in five years
- Following week: retail sales down 7.7% year-over-year

#### Stock Market Collapse Without Single Winning Day

> "During this period of constant bad news, stocks sold off literally every day."

- **Oct 1–Oct 10**: S&P 500 lost 22% total, without single day of gains
- Crude oil fell rapidly, ending first half of month at $75/barrel
- **Oct 9**: Stocks sold off 7.6% on record volume "with virtually nothing important enough to warrant it"

#### Credit Crisis Beyond Finance

- Major nonfinancial corporations relying on credit lines as corporate paper markets shut out
- Companies slashing dividends to preserve cash
- Money-market fund outflows continued
- Consumer credit fell in August—first time since 1998
- Similar stories globally as liquidity dried up everywhere

### Policy Response: Commercial Paper Funding Facility (Oct 7)

- Fed announced plan to purchase unsecured commercial paper
- Created **Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)**: technically independent entity buying commercial paper using Fed Section 13(3) loans
- In practice: Fed financing commercial paper purchases directly, no Treasury backstop
- **Extraordinary authority**: Took Fed to edge or beyond statutory authority—central banks generally not permitted such risky credit exposure
- Fed "bravely did what it needed to do" and hoped CPFF fees could cover losses

### Shift to Bank Capitalization

- Days after TARP passage, **Paulson began hinting** funds might capitalize banks instead of just purchasing troubled assets
- **Oct 9**: White House officials signaled TARP money might go to capital injections

### Columbus Day Weekend: G7 Coordination (Oct 11–13)

- **"Single largest push on the part of policy makers"**
- **Saturday, Oct 11**: President Bush met G7 members in Washington for coordinated international effort
- Agreed G7 members would:
  - Inject capital into banking institutions
  - Increase deposit insurance guarantees
- Next two days: Treasury finalized America's commitment
- **Two bold centerpieces**:
  1. Huge expansion of FDIC insurance coverage
  2. Massive injection of capital into banking system

#### Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program

- **FDIC authority stretched** under new Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to:
  - Guarantee debt of any single systemically important bank
  - Backstop losses on all newly issued unsecured debt by banks and bank-holding companies
  - Guarantee all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts
- Amounted to guarantee of nearly all bank debt—extraordinary measure with feared unintended consequences

> "To be frank, I hated these options, but I didn't want to preside over a meltdown." — Hank Paulson

#### Capital Purchase Program

- Treasury planned to take equity stakes in as many banking institutions as possible
- Limit: 3% of risk-weighted assets or $250B
- Investments as preferred stock with 5% dividend
- **Key**: Paulson needed even healthiest banks to participate—otherwise participation would stigmatize and encourage runs
- **Monday, Oct 13**: Paulson invited nine major bank CEOs to private conference room
- Explained he expected everyone to participate, prescribed amount of capital each should take
- None left without taking government money
- By meeting end: Paulson pledged $125B of $700B Congress gave him

### Market Deterioration Continues

- Even with cash injection, markets in US, Europe, Japan continued to worsen
- Became clear to **Paulson, Bernanke, Geithner**: had to act with even greater force
- Very consequential meetings with G7 central bankers and finance ministers

#### Warning About Speed

- Several people warned Paulson teams "perhaps moving too fast" and doing so could be dangerous
- **Paulson's belief**: If policy makers didn't move quickly, would have nothing that works when markets opened Tuesday after Columbus Day weekend

### Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program—"Most Powerful Step"

- **Paulson**: Most powerful step was Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
- FDIC used funds (established to protect savers) to **guarantee liabilities of financial institutions**, including unsecured liabilities of bank holding companies
- FDIC general counsel initially said this was illegal
- Paulson and others spent time convincing head **Sheila Bair** this was right thing to do
- She "ultimately made the very courageous decision to back it—which made a huge difference"

### Market Reaction (Oct 13)

- As news leaked Monday Oct 13 (and policy makers worldwide announced similar projects):
- **Stocks rallied 11.6%—largest single-day increase in S&P 500 since 1939**

### Significance of October Announcements

- **Turning point**: Up to this point, most government responses were ad hoc reactions to individual disasters
- Fed had borne disproportionately large burden, unclear if other agencies would adequately support
- **Now**: Increasingly clear US and global policy makers committed to "taking extraordinary, coordinated action"
- Still huge uncertainties ahead, underlying economy continued deteriorating

#### BDO Oct 13 Assessment

> "(BDO) October 13: The Governments Are Doing Everything Possible; Now We Will Have to See If It's In Time"

- These are great moves, doing everything hoped for
- **But**: Would have worked in stage one (e.g., instead of Lehman bankruptcy)—crisis now spread to stage 3
- "We just have to wait and see"
- Big question: Will massive liquidity injections and bank recapitalizations "get to those who are at the periphery of the system"?
- Many dominoes falling beyond government reach, hard to know effects
- **First time confident**: "Major developed countries' governments are doing all in their power to deal with this crisis"

### Continued Volatility

- Fears and uncertainties kept volatility extremely high
- **Wednesday**: Stocks fell 9% on grim retail sales and Bernanke warning recovery would be slow
- **Thursday**: Market rebounded 4.3%

#### Credit Conditions Begin Thawing (Oct 20)

- **By Monday, Oct 20**: Markets registered meaningful easing in interbank lending and commercial paper
- Commercial paper rates touched four-week lows, short-term treasury yields crept up
- Thawing of credit conditions helped lift stocks, represented significant easing of pressure on banks

### Global Dollar Squeeze

- **Financial mismatches** still squeezing institutions (borrowing short/lending long, borrowing one currency/lending another)
- **Dollar squeeze**: Foreign financial institutions borrowed dollars and lent them out, now had to pay back and/or deal with debtors who had to pay back in dollars when dollars, money, credit hard to come by
- Fed continually expanded dollar swap lines throughout October with developed-world central banks
- **Not able** to provide enough dollar liquidity to alleviate global dollar squeeze
- Part of problem: Central banks reluctant to lend Fed-provided dollars against locally denominated collateral (fears of default, logistical issues)
- **Largest squeeze**: Emerging markets, where dollar debts built up and debtors scrambling for dollars
- **Dollar rallied 8% in October**

#### BDO Oct 22: The Dollar Squeeze Explanation

> "A debt is a short cash position—i.e., a commitment to deliver cash that one doesn't have. Because the dollar is the world's reserve currency, and because of the dollar surplus recycling that has taken place over the past few years…lots of dollar denominated debt has been built up around the world. So, as dollar liquidity has become tight, there has been a dollar squeeze. This squeeze…is hitting dollar-indebted emerging markets (particularly those of commodity exporters) and is supporting the dollar. When this short squeeze ends, which will happen when either the debtors default or get the liquidity to prevent their default, the US dollar will decline."

### Price Volatility Driven by Positioning

- Actual price = spending on item / quantity of item sold (P = $/Q)
- **Key insights**:
  - a) Knowing who is spending and who is selling (and why) ideal way to understand prices
  - b) Prices don't always react to fundamentals as characterized by those seeking to explain price movements in connection with news
- **During this period**: Volatility extremely high for reasons having nothing to do with fundamentals, everything to do with who getting in/out of positions for various reasons
  - Being squeezed, no longer squeezed, rebalancing portfolios, etc.
- **Example**: Tuesday Oct 28, S&P gained 10%+; next day fell 1.1% when Fed cut rates another 50 basis points
- **Month end**: S&P down 17%—largest single-month drop since October 1987

## November–December 2008

### Obama Election (Nov 4)

- Barack Obama elected President amid record turnout
- Would enter office with big majorities in both houses
- Had promised billions in government spending on infrastructure, unemployment insurance, Medicaid
- Supportive of TARP, control of Congress would allow quick action

### Economic Freefall Accelerates

> "While the financial contagion may have been slowed by the Treasury and the Fed's actions so far, it became clearer in the last couple months of 2008 that the economy was falling at a far faster pace than even the most pessimistic observers feared, and that we were heading for the worst downturn since the Great Depression and into the great unknown."

- Economy now in **classic early deleveraging/depression** phase
- Monetary policy could not work normally, interest rates could no longer be lowered, innumerable credit avenues dried up

#### November Economic Data

- Most important stats worse than already very poor expectations
- Consumer spending fell at extraordinary rate
- Retail sales fell 8%+, auto sales down 30% year-over-year
- Businesses reacted with historic layoffs
- Unemployment rate moved past 6.8% (highest since 1994), projections for layoffs/unemployment increased dramatically
- December: worst manufacturing reading since 1982
- **"The economy was imploding"**

### Auto Industry Crisis

- Auto industry in particular remained in dire straits, actively sought federal backstops
- Treasury reluctant to broaden $700B TARP to include industrial companies
- Unwilling to assist major automakers
- **Early November**: Treasury turned down General Motors request for $10B to help finance possible Chrysler merger
- Without federal funding and nonfunctional credit markets, automakers turned to selling assets
- Ford and GM sold stakes in other automakers during month

#### Major Financial Institution Losses

- **Nov 10**: AIG reported $25B quarterly loss (secured additional $150B from government to curtail contagion)
- **Fannie Mae**: Posted $29B loss, said might need more than $100B Treasury already pledged

### Paulson Shifts TARP Strategy (Mid-November)

- Paulson hadn't said anything publicly about changing thinking (didn't want to influence election)
- Market expecting significant asset repurchase program
- **Mid-November postelection speech**: Announced plans for modifying Treasury's TARP use:
  - No longer planned to buy illiquid assets (market frozen)
  - Funds channeled to banks and nonbank financial companies (not auto) as equity-like capital
  - New lending program targeted at consumer lending markets (auto loans, credit cards, student loans)
- **Market reaction**: Negative to adjustment

> "As I feared, the markets focused on the fact that there wouldn't be a program to purchase mortgage-related assets." — Hank Paulson

- S&P dropped 5.2%

#### Stock Market New Low (Nov 20)

- Stocks reached new low Nov 20, down 20%+ for month (52% from highs)
- Oil collapsed (now below $50/barrel)
- Home prices continued falling
- **But**: New low met with relatively quick reversal on news Obama would nominate:
  - **Timothy Geithner**: Treasury secretary
  - **Larry Summers**: Director of National Economic Council
  - Both justifiably considered highly capable

#### Larry Summers Background

- Came into job concerned about possibility of major debt crisis for a while
- In speech early March before Bear's collapse:

> "I believe that we are facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses that the United States has faced in a generation—and possibly much longer than that"

- Was advocate of big policy moves in response to crisis
- Would be key decision-maker in administration's policy toward auto companies
- **Bernanke** stayed at Fed—good continuity among economic team leaders
- Moves helped assure policy continuity between administrations

### First Quantitative Easing (Nov 25)

- **Federal Reserve and Treasury announced $800B** in lending and asset purchases aimed at pushing down mortgage rates (help housing market)
- Central bank committed to purchases of $600B in debt tied to home loans
- **First Quantitative Easing (QE) program**—classic and critical step in managing deleveraging
- Central bankers in crises forced to choose between:
  1. "Printing" more money (beyond what's needed for bank liquidity) to replace decline in private credit
  2. Allowing big tightening as credit collapses

> "They inevitably choose to print, as they did in this case, which is when things changed dramatically."

#### Comparison to 1930s Depression

> "I hope you will read the prior section, about the US debt crisis in the 1928–38 period (as well as look at the other cases) to see how true this is. What was different in 2008 was the speed with which the policy makers made this crucial step. The 1930–33 depression went on so long because policy makers were so slow to react—not because their problems were worse, because they weren't. Still, the 2008 crisis would have been a lot less painful if the policy makers had acted even earlier."

- 30-year fixed mortgage rates fell nearly 1% on news
- 10-year Treasury yields declined 22 basis points
- Stock market ended month down 7.5%—"wasn't clear if these moves were too little too late"

### Auto Industry Bailout Debate

#### TARP and Auto Industry

- TARP enacted to deal with financial institutions
- **Paulson** repeatedly said didn't intend to use TARP funds for autos
- **Bush Administration**: Didn't want auto bankruptcy, worked diligently with Congress to prevent one
- Tried to get legislative authority to use portion of $25B Congress already appropriated (for autos to meet fuel efficiency standards) for emergency loans for restructuring
- Real progress in House, but legislation stalled in Senate mid-December

#### Bush Extends Emergency Loans (Dec 19)

- **Dec 19**: Just before leaving office, President Bush officially announced plans to extend $13.4B in emergency loans to Chrysler and GM
- By month end, government expanded bailout package unexpectedly, delivering additional support to auto industry (buoyed stocks)
- Because TARP money could only go to financial institutions, funds directed through auto companies' financing arm
- **GMAC** (General Motors financing affiliate) approved to reorganize as bank (receive federal aid)
- GMAC started making new loans to less credit-worthy borrowers
- Then helped auto companies by recapitalizing and rescuing their finance companies just before leaving office
- **Market optimism**: Fiscal stimulus being pledged by president-elect Obama
- Transition exemplified "very best of political behavior" on part of both transitioning presidents
- Continuity of Bernanke and Geithner on economic leadership team helped

### Uncertainty About Recovery

- While all moves were big, good reason to question whether damage already done too great for full recovery
- Stocks rallied on hope of stimulus and progress with automakers
- December ended with volatility (uncertainty) priced to remain high

#### Bridgewater's 2008 Performance

- Bridgewater closed out 2008 with significant gains for investors when most had significant losses
- "What a year! What a relief!"

<!-- pp. 481-500 -->

## Transition from an "Ugly" to a "Beautiful" Deleveraging: 2009

### Historical Parallel: 2008 Crisis and the Great Depression

- Understanding the **Great Depression template** and prior deleveragings proved critical to navigating 2008-2009
- Chart comparing 1925-1940s to 2008-2009 shows parallel patterns: interest rates hit virtually 0% in both cases, followed by "money printing"
- **Only two times since 1900** that rates reached 0% and QE followed—in both cases, markets and economy bottomed immediately after

> "Quantitative easing is like a giant shot of adrenalin to save a patient that is having a massive heart attack. The only question I had in late 2008 was if this overdue and great move would work or if it had come too late."

- Money supply (M0) spiked dramatically in both the 1930s and 2008, coinciding with zero interest rates

### Economic Conditions: Early 2009

**January 2009 assessment (BDO note):**
- Economy in **freefall**—credit contraction hitting employment hardest
- Cascade: financial sector → demand → employment
- January saw 62,000 job cuts reported in a single day
- Five major institutions at risk of failure: **Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America** (each larger than Lehman)
- Untested Obama administration inheriting the crisis

**Credit contraction dynamics:**
- Businesses must generate cash flow internally—cannot rely on loans during credit freeze
- This **magnifies pressure to lay off workers**
- Payroll reductions exceeded 500,000/month in November-December as businesses tried to sustain operating earnings

### Obama Administration's Early Moves

**February 10: Geithner's Financial Stability Plan**
- Announced plan to "clean up and strengthen the nation's banks"
- Would **stress test** major banks to determine capital needs
- Capital would be shored up via combination of public and private funds
- Market reaction: **S&P fell 3% during speech, ended day down 4.9%**
- Investors uncertain: Would there be nationalizations? Who bears losses—shareholders or taxpayers?
- Only broad strokes provided, leaving investors expecting the worst

**Joint statement to counter nationalization rumors:**
- Treasury, FDIC, OCC, OTS, and Federal Reserve issued statement
- **"Strong presumption"** banks should remain in private hands under the Capital Assistance Program
- Market still unconvinced—**S&P fell 3.5% on the day**

### The Stress Test

**Design:**
- Fed would assess how banks would withstand major contraction: **3.3% GDP contraction, 8.9% unemployment, 22% fall in housing prices**
- Banks lacking capital would turn to private markets first, then public funds
- Dalio's team had run similar estimates for 18 months—marked holdings to market, ran scenario analysis
- "Pretty confident that our estimates were good"—eager to see if Fed's numbers would align

### Fiscal Stimulus Measures

**American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (February 17):**
- **$787 billion total**: $288B tax reductions, $144B state/local governments, $105B infrastructure, rest federal spending
- Tax reduction funneled to taxpayers **within days**—virtually instantaneous stimulus
- Infrastructure spending would take years to ramp up—mattered less in short term

**Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (February 18):**
- **Up to $275 billion** to address housing crisis
- Goal: help "as many as nine million American homeowners refinance their mortgages or avert foreclosure"
- $75B direct spending to keep at-risk homeowners in homes
- Incentives for lenders to alter loan terms for troubled borrowers
- Additional **$200B to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac**

**Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF):**
- Fed policy lending up to **$1 trillion on non-recourse basis** to holders of AAA asset-backed securities
- Helped stimulate consumer loans (auto, credit card, student)
- Extension of liquidity programs set to expire end of April
- Despite all this stimulus, **markets continued to fall**

### March Crisis Deepens

**Sunday, March 1: AIG news**
- AIG to report **$62 billion 4th quarter loss** (largest quarterly loss in US corporate history)
- Treasury and Fed agreed to provide additional **$30 billion in capital** and loosen earlier loan terms
- Markets plunged Monday on **knock-on effects fears**
- February economic data: economy shed 651,000 jobs, auto sales fell 5.8% to weakest level since early 1980s

**March 9: The Bottom**
- World Bank issued pessimistic report
- **Warren Buffett** said economy had "fallen off a cliff"
- Stock market fell 1%, investor sentiment extremely bearish, selling exhausted
- **Day the bottom in US stock market and top in dollar were made** (unknowable at the time)

**March 10: Rally begins**
- Stocks surged **6.4%**, led by 38% jump in Citigroup shares
- Citigroup CEO memo: bank "once again profitable"
- **Chairman Bernanke** speech on financial regulation reforms well-received
- Reports lawmakers close to re-instituting uptick rule to slow short-selling

## Policy Makers Launch Coordinated Counterattack: March-April 2009

### The "Shock and Awe" Campaign

**Policy makers at the Fed and Treasury planned coordinated set of policies designed to shore up the financial system and provide money needed to make up for contracting credit**

- Much more aggressive than earlier easings
- Released in sequence of mega-announcements
- **How they were announced magnified the impact on markets**

**March 18: Expanded QE**
- Fed announced expanding QE purchases: **$750B Agency MBS, $100B agency debt**
- Would expand to **US government bonds—up to $300B over next six months**
- Expanded TALF collateral eligible to wider set of financial assets
- Stated expectations of **"keeping rates exceptionally low for an extended period"**

**Market reaction to $1 trillion+ announcement was huge:**
- Enormous Treasury rally—**48 basis point fall in yields** (biggest change in couple decades)
- Stocks rallied, dollar sold off, gold rallied
- Intraday charts show magnitude of moves following announcement

**March 23: Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP)**
- **Geithner** announced plan to buy **$500B to $1 trillion** worth of troubled assets from banks
- Three-part PPIP incentivized private investment firms to buy banks' bad assets using their own capital
- Allowed firms to **leverage investments in troubled assets** using Fed-borrowed money
- Guarantee: would not lose more than initial investment if assets fell below initial value
- Also announced possible TALF expansion to finance residential/commercial MBS and legacy securities eligibility

**Market reaction:**
- S&P rose **7.1%**, led by 18% rally in financial shares

**March 24: Financial Regulation Overhaul**
- Fed and Treasury announced plans to overhaul financial regulations
- Expand government power to seize **"too big to fail" banks**, insurers, investment banks, investment funds
- Two days later, Geithner outlined wider overhaul of financial regulations
- Greatly increased federal regulatory oversight of insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity funds
- Expanded regulatory powers over any company deemed "too big to fail"
- Well-received by markets though not key part of stimulative counterattack

### GM and Chrysler "Cushioned Bankruptcy"

**End of March:**
- **Summers** and **Geithner** oversaw team led by **Steven Rattner** to create plan for GM and Chrysler
- **Larry Summers** described it as **"cushioned bankruptcy"**
- Bankruptcy would force trade unions and creditors to negotiate debt reductions
- Ample US government support (including large guarantee of GM's car warrantees) would ensure GM could remain functioning during restructuring
- Auto companies felt they couldn't function in bankruptcy
- Summers thought with sufficient support, bankrupt auto company could function—**no reason debt needed to be paid in full**

### April 2: G20 and FASB Announcements

**First announcement: G20 IMF funding expansion**
- G20 agreed to **greater than expected increase to IMF funding**
- Immediately provide **$250 billion** in additional IMF financing
- Aim to eventually add **up to $500 billion** in new lending capacity
- Would combine with IMF's existing ~$250B liquid resources
- Combination of dramatically expanded IMF lending capacity and more flexible terms expected to **dramatically reduce immediate liquidity needs** of emerging-market countries
- **Emerging currencies soared** following announcement

**Second announcement: FASB eases mark-to-market rules**
- **Financial Accounting Standards Board** passed two proposals to ease mark-to-market accounting
- Changes gave banks **more discretion in reporting value of mortgage securities**
- Markets embraced the move
- Dalio's view at the time: **relatively little impact** on banks' abilities to write off losses over time, while relieving some (but not all) accounting pressures on insurance companies

### Scale of Government Response

**Unprecedented coordination:**
- Dalio characterized moves as **"an enormous wave"**
- Table shared with clients (April 2009): added up all US government purchases and guarantees announced by then
- **Remarkably, US government was backstopping two-thirds of all debt, about $29 trillion dollars**

### Obama's Hands-On Leadership Style

**Contrast with Bush:**
- **Bush** took hands-off approach, believing team knew best
- **Obama** took hands-on approach—digging into facts, numbers, actively engaged in discussions
- Instituted **presidential daily economic briefing** (analogous to daily national security briefing)
- Every morning: president met with economic team, every meeting about ongoing crisis for first months
- According to **Larry Summers**: president read every word they sent him, very much into understanding approach, why recommended, alternatives being turned down
- **"It was a time when market and economic developments were more important than anything else"**

### Investor Behavior in the Bear Market

**Three broad categories:**
1. **Clobbered investors who reduced risk as fear grew**—sold "risky" assets the more they got clobbered
2. **Clobbered investors with blind faith**—held on or bought more risky assets
3. **Those with good understanding** of what was happening who sold high and bought low—**very few in this group**

**Dalio's position:**
- Had done good job up until that point
- **Didn't want to take on hardly any bets at this stage**
- In 2007 bubble: gap between market pricing discounts and likely outcomes appeared very large
- Now (early 2009): market pricing discounting terrible conditions, range of potential outcomes enormous
- While policy makers making right moves, **whether they would work and what else lay beneath surface in exposures remained unknown**

### The Unprecedented Nature of the Response

> "Like pandemics, D-processes come along very infrequently, so we don't have many to look back on and, in those that we have, this antidote was never administered in this dosage."

**No such thing as getting everything exactly right, especially in eyes of everyone:**
- **Public uproar** over Treasury's actions
- Especially about how "generous" deal was for recapitalized banks
- Criticism that bankers weren't being punished
- Reports that **AIG paid large, previously-committed bonuses** after receiving bailout focused on **Geithner's** knowledge and whether he allowed them
- Infuriated public already upset with bailouts, put Treasury's plans for further action at risk

### The Classic Dilemma

> "As economic pain increases, populist calls to 'punish the bankers that caused this mess' are the norm and they make it difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are necessary to save the financial system and the economy."

- At such times, bankers can want to stop "being bankers" by stopping investing or lending
- Their doing so in midst of crisis **would make the crisis much worse**

**Crisis handling vs. populism:**
- While financial crisis and handling contributed somewhat to rise of populism in subsequent years
- **In the end, saving the system is much more important than striving for precision**
- **Larry Summers** comparison to **battlefield medicine**—it's never perfect, you're going to realize you made mistakes, you're going to look bad even if you do the best possible job
- Dalio: "I can't say this enough: in my opinion, judging the policy makers in this way is unfair. The fact that they do their job anyway, and that they help as many people as they do, is what makes them heroes in my eyes."

**The AIG bonus controversy:**
- Mid-March, peak of controversy: Congress and media publicly calling for **Secretary Geithner's resignation**
- Though he had executed job with great skill, wisdom, and care
- Had they succeeded in forcing resignation or derailed Treasury's bold plans to recapitalize banking system, **bad economic consequences would have been large**

**Geithner on public outrage:**
> "The public outrage was appropriate, and I understood why the President wanted to embrace it, but I didn't see how we could ever satisfy it. We had no legal authority to confiscate the bonuses that had been paid during the boom. We had no power to set compensation for most private firms. We had more authority over firms receiving TARP funds, but we couldn't reduce bonuses to levels that the public might find acceptable without unleashing an exodus of talent from those banks, reducing their prospects of navigating their way to safety. In any case, I thought the public's rage on these issues was insatiable. I feared the tougher we talked about the bonuses, the more we would own them, fueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry."

**House response:**
- After what was seen as Geithner's lack of action, House passed bill March 19 putting **90% tax on bonuses** paid by companies receiving government bailouts worth $5B or more
- Scope limited mostly to AIG bonuses
- Sense of distrust for government support among many executives in financial sector (who saw tax as government changing rules after the fact) would be continuing source of tension

### Market Dynamics: Tops and Bottoms

**Fortunately, bottoms in markets and economy were being made:**
- Had things gotten worse or gone on longer, capitalist and democratic system would've been at risk of breaking
- All else being equal: **prices for goods, services, and investment assets go down when rate of buying lessens and go up when rate of selling lessens**

**Key insight:**
> "Tops are typically made when the rate of buying is unsustainable (which is also when people think prices will rise) and bottoms are made when the rate of selling is at a pace that's unsustainable (typically when most people are bearish)."

- In weeks before and after big announcements: pressures eased, signs of economic rebound emerged, markets rallied
- Economic releases first week of April: while economy continued to contract during March, **pace of contraction was slower than expected**
- Charts show major economic stats contracting through March at fastest pace in decades, but **contractions looked to be leveling off and maybe reversing**

**Mid-April rally:**
- Stock and commodity markets around world had rebounded sharply from March lows
- **S&P up 25%**, oil up over 20%, bank CDS spreads fell almost 30%
- But in level terms remained near extremes—appeared more due to **slower rate of selling than pickup in buying**

### Question: Bottom or Bear Market Rally?

**Historical context:**
- There had been classic bear market rallies along the way
- S&P staged **19% rally** over a week at end of October
- **24% rally** over last six weeks of 2008 before giving up gains and hitting new lows

**Uncertainty remained about whether this was the true bottom or another false rally**

## The Beginning of the Beautiful Deleveraging: June–December 2009

### Recovery Phase Begins

- Second half 2009: policies (QE, fiscal stimulus, macro-prudential measures) reduced risk, increased buying of risky assets, economy began recovering
- Shift analogous to previous **"beautiful deleveragings"**
- S&P 500 chart shows recovery from March 2009 lows:
  - $600bn in asset purchases announced
  - Further $1.1 trillion announced and started
  - Market climbed from ~650 to ~1,100 by December

### Inflation Fears Prove Unfounded

- Frequent concerns about inflation from central bank "printing money" didn't materialize
- Fed's printing wouldn't cause inflation acceleration if it was **replacing contracting credit**

> "Reflations don't necessarily cause inflation because they can simply negate deflations, depending on how far they are taken and what the money goes to."

- Inflation is oversimplistic—it's an average of many different things:
  - During reflations/depressions: little/no inflation in labor costs and production assets (real estate, equipment)
  - Inflation in assets benefiting from currency devaluation (commodities, gold, internationally traded goods)

### Regulatory Reform Timeline

Congress and **Obama administration** shifted to significantly increasing financial regulation:

- **June 17**: Obama speech proposing comprehensive financial reform (eventually **Dodd-Frank**)
  - Heightened regulation, consolidation of regulatory bodies
  - Greater authority to Fed, consumer protections
  - More regulation of credit rating agencies
  - Updated bank winding-down rules
  - Bill wouldn't pass until 2010

- **June 24**: SEC proposed money market fund regulations
  - Required highly liquid investments
  - Restricted holdings to high-quality securities

- **June 30**: Treasury proposed **Consumer Financial Protection Agency**
  - Would control consumer protections from Fed, Comptroller, Office of Thrift Supervision, FDIC, FTC, National Credit Union Administration

- **July 23**: Fed proposed changes to **Regulation Z (Truth in Lending)**
  - Improve consumer disclosure for closed-end mortgages and home-equity credit
  - Required APR and monthly payments communicated to buyer on adjustable-rate loans

- **October 22**: Fed proposed review of 28 banking organizations' incentive compensation policies
  - TARP Special Master released executive compensation determinations for top 25 highest paid at seven firms receiving assistance

- **December 11**: House passed Financial Stability Council and Consumer Financial Protection Agency

### Pattern: Post-Crisis Regulatory Tightening

**Changing laws to prevent the crisis is typical at the end of big debt crises.** Then over long time frames (~25 years):
- Hangover wears off, new euphoria sets in
- Laws increasingly flouted
- New leverage forms produced by new entities
- Leads to new debt crisis evolving similarly

## 2010 through Mid-2011

### Economic Disconnect

- Early 2010: financial markets strong (up 65% from March 2009 lows)
  - Flush with liquidity from Fed's QE
  - Safer due to fiscal/regulatory changes
- But economy labored: borrowers weaker/cautious, lending standards tightened

### Markets Price In Premature Normalization

- Credit markets priced in Fed would tighten 2-3 times within the year
- Odd given conditions: unemployment still near postwar highs, wage growth stuck, home prices flat and well-below peak
- Many middle-class mortgage borrowers remained underwater
- Credit standards tightened
- Financially okay borrowers disinclined to lever up; those inclined were financially dead
- Hard to imagine normal pickup

### Global Stimulus Slowdown

- Most central banks/governments slowing aggressive stimulus
- Fed ended first QE round March 2010 after purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities
- Fiscal stimulus (America Recovery and Reinvestment Act) set to peak later in year
- Abroad: pockets of tightening (China increased interest rates)

### The QE Debate: Flow vs. Amount

**Critically misunderstood**: merely slowing/ending QE was equivalent to tightening—**not different from raising interest rates**

- Some thought pumping money into economy enough to stimulate (Fed had printed over $2 trillion)
- But **flow of money more important than amount**—the flow of asset purchases sustained value increases and lending growth
- Credit growth remained slow
- Fed's stimulus then believed too much and irresponsible
- **Dalio's view**: doubted developed economies would tighten as fast as priced in

### BDO February 17: The Coming Tightening

> "(BDO) February 17: The Coming Tightening: It is now the established view among the electorate, central bankers, and elected officials that central banks printing and buying of financial assets and central governments budget deficits must be reined in because these actions are financially irresponsible. We think that this universally accepted view is at best premature and at worst dangerous….When we take a sharp pencil to these plans and their implications, we conclude that it is too much restraint—unless there is either major pickup in private debt growth or a major realignment of developed and emerging country currencies, both of which appear unlikely to happen in the amounts required."

### European Debt Crisis Emerges

- Pro forma financial projections showed debt crisis brewing in Europe
- Mismatch between: a) borrowing debtors needed to rollover maturing debt, and b) lending banks could provide with already-stretched balance sheets
- **February**: Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, especially **Greece** struggled with debt obligations and deteriorating conditions
- Day-to-day volatility in global markets
- Most assessed issue contained to Greece (potentially Portugal), wouldn't pose larger problems for European monetary system or global economy
- Early February calculation: **problem would be much worse**

### BDO February 4: Tightening + Over-indebtedness = High Risk

> "We judge the over-indebtedness problems of the European debtor countries (PIGS) to be comparable in magnitude to some of the worst emerging-market debt problems of the past."

- 5Yr CDS spreads chart shows spreads widen early 2010 (mainly Greece and Portugal)

### European Policy Mistakes

European debt crisis a different story, but **same sequence of events**:
- Policy makers didn't believe they'd face debt crisis until they had it
- Made same rookie mistakes:
  - Leaning too heavily on deflationary levers like austerity
  - Not printing money
  - Not providing default protections for systemically important entities
  - Until pain became intolerable

### Market Correction: May–July 2010

- US equity market rallied nearly 10% through late April
- Fell over 15% May–July on:
  - Contagion worries about Europe
  - Softness in US economic numbers
- Weakness led to realization Fed likely to maintain 0% interest rate policy
- US bond yields fell over 100 basis points over next four months
- Economic improvement slowed summer 2010
- Labor market showed modest improvement (unemployment claims), but unemployment rate still near highs
- Still lot of slack in economy—weakness at this level would have been terrible

### Bernanke's Jackson Hole Speech (August 2010)

**Bernanke** addressed further QE at Jackson Hole, making clear it was key policy option:

> "a first option for providing additional monetary accommodation, if necessary, is to expand the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities."

- Emphasized belief QE had been effective and "made an important contribution to the economic stabilization and recovery"
- 10-year break-even inflation rate fallen 50 basis points in months leading to speech
- Reflected concerns of sustained very low inflation or deflation
- After signaling further QE was strong possibility, markets rebounded strongly
- Real economy response naturally lagged but picked up soon

### Fed Officials Signal More Action Needed

**October 2010**: New York Fed President **Bill Dudley** described conditions as "wholly unsatisfactory," argued "further action is likely to be warranted"

- Assessment of US growth drivers broadly similar to Dalio's (from October 1 BDO):
  - Consumers facing slow income growth, lower asset prices, much lower ability to borrow
  - Result of lower wealth, higher debt levels, lower incomes
  - Households hadn't responded to lower rates by saving less or borrowing

### BDO October 6: The Next Shoe to Drop: More QE and Devaluations

> "(BDO) October 6: The Next Shoe to Drop: More QE and Devaluations: What is happening is all very classic. Though they're all different, in most ways deleveragings are basically the same and transpire via a similar sequence of events."

- References to *Daily Observations* and "Template for Understanding What's Going On"
- Won't dwell on full sequence, but key reminders especially relevant:

**All deleveragings** require:
- Declines in private sector credit growth
- Increases in central bank money creation AND central government deficits to offset
- Though many financially conservative and feel printing money to bail out debtors/creditors is unethical:
  - **Austerity to deal with debt-deleveraging has never worked when problems were big**
  - When tried persistently, eventually abandoned by all governments (didn't work, too painful)
  - Decreased borrowing/spending (and employment consequences) make deleveraging self-reinforcing on downside
  - Increased debts/spending that cause bubbles self-reinforcing on upside
- Result: all studied deleveragings (most over last couple hundred years) eventually led to:
  - Big waves of money creation
  - Fiscal deficits
  - Currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, stocks)

### QE2 Broadly Worked

Despite continued Europe debt problems, US economy/markets finished 2010 on high note:
- Growth picked up after brief lull between QE1 and QE2
- S&P 500 had 13% total returns for 2010
- Inflation expectations re-anchored by Fed's proven determination to continue stimulating as long as necessary

### BDO March 15: Transitioning Beyond the "Sweet Spot"

US economy going through post-contraction growth spurt supported by monetary policy, fiscal policy, credit growth improvement. With:
- Considerable slack domestically (and Europe/Japan)
- Overheating demand in emerging countries
- Limited inflation pressures (largely from items demanded by emerging countries)

> "Said differently, 2010/2011 in a cyclical context appears quite like the 'sweet spot' part of the cycle that typically occurs during the first two years of a recovery, when there remains adequate slack and low inflation pressures."

- However, recovery from contraction during deleveraging more dependent on Fed's money printing and central government's fiscal stimulus

### US Financial System Success Metrics

By this point, government programs to support financial system broadly worked. Compared to other countries, US experienced:
- Relatively fast speed at which financial system recapitalized (and TARP capital repaid)
- Relatively fast speed at which they unwound emergency credit programs
- Good overall financial returns on rescue across various programs

### Case Study Endpoint: Q2 2011

End case study here because **Q2 2011**: real GDP returned to pre-crisis levels

- Wasn't end of recovery by any means
- Still plenty of slack and self-reinforcing upward cycle
- Charts show through 2018 (tenth anniversary of 2008 Lehman crisis):
  - Unemployment rate
  - S&P 500
  - RGDP Growth (Y/Y)
  - GDP Gap (showing slack in economy's capacity to produce)

### Debt-to-GDP Projections

- Second set of charts: existing and projected debt-to-GDP ratios 1920 until 10 years from now
- Charts for four sectors:
  - Government (rising to ~140% projected)
  - Non-Financial Business (rising to ~100% projected)
  - Households (declining from peak ~100% to ~80% projected)
  - Financials (declining from peak ~130% to ~80% projected)
- **Note**: numbers don't include non-debt obligations (pensions, health care) which are considerably larger—"another issue to be explained at another time"

- **Sept 6-7**: Credit crisis contained (briefly); foreclosure rate hits record
- **Sept 7**: **BDO's "The Bigger Problem"** commentary:

> "What is happening here is bigger than what the world now commonly refers to as the 'credit crisis.' Normally, credit problems occur when borrowers get into a lot of debt/debt flows suffer...But imagine a dynamic in which the credit keeps flowing and debts keep increasing. That is the dynamic that's happening. It is an extension of having too much credit/liquidity, not too little...The American household sector as a whole is now in pretty bad shape (i.e., has a bad balance sheet and poor cash flow outlook), so that pushing more money into its hands will lead to worse not better financial problems pretty quickly." (BDO)

In particular, it is used to caution against creating an expectation that there will be future 'bail-outs.'"

- **Mar 6**: Home foreclosures reach all-time high (7.9%) in 2007; mortgage defaults jump to 7.9% from 7.3% (Sept) and 6.1% (Dec 2006) — never risen past 7% since 1979 survey began
- **Mar 7**: Economy loses 63,000 jobs (February) — unexpected, ominous decline
- **Mar 10**: **BDO's "Slipping Away"** warning:

> "As you know we have a vague fear that the degree of levered counterparty positions that have built up over the years creates a kind of house of financial cards. With financial markets making new lows, new problems are popping up. More and more entities are failing on margin calls, and this is flowing through to the dealers who have the exposures when entities fail on margin. Financials were crushed Monday as rumors of liquidity trouble at Bear Stearns flew...Bear Stearns has entered a non-equilibrium situation, as its business, in all likelihood, cannot be sustained at current market prices. Either things are going to get a lot better, or a lot worse for Bear."

- **Mar 11**: **Fed announces $200B Term Auction Facility** — allows financial institutions to borrow ultra-safe Treasury money using riskiest investments as collateral
- **Mar 11**: Dow climbs 416.66 points (biggest gain in >5 years) after Fed liquidity injection
- **Mar 11**: **BDO on required interventions**: "1) providing liquidity to financially strained financial intermediaries, 2) changing accounting rules so that the losses can be written off over adequate time to prevent their ruin and/or material contractions in their balance sheets, and c) improving accounting by making it clear that these actions will keep the financial system operating effectively. The Fed is doing its part. The Treasury, Congress and accounting regulators aren't doing their parts yet."
- **Mar 14**: **JPMorgan/Fed move to bail out Bear Stearns** — Fed provides secured funding for up to 28 days
- **Mar 14**: Stocks tumble on Bear Stearns troubles — "rocked Wall Street's confidence in the fragile credit market"
- **Mar 17**: **Fed approves $30B credit line** to facilitate Bear Stearns takeover; announces **open-ended lending program** for biggest investment firms
- **Mar 17**: **BDO commentary on Fed action**:

> "We think the Fed is doing a great job. We wouldn't do anything different because doing anything different would produce intolerable results. Of course we have moral hazard concerns; we believe the Fed does too. But the line has to be drawn somewhere and we think that it is at that point that the equity of the financial intermediary is essentially gone and/or at the point that the credit problems pass to others -- and that is taking it right to the edge (perhaps a bit too far). While we believe the Fed is acting appropriately, that does not mean that we are confident that things will be all right. That's because the Fed can't do it alone (i.e., as you know, we think we need the accounting changes and they are for others to provide). Also, what probably will be required of the Fed boggles the mind. The good thing is that they now realize how serious the problems are. The question is whether they can move fast enough. As mentioned, an avalanche can be prevented, but it can't be reversed."

- **Mar 18**: Dow surges 420 points on Fed rate cut and earnings
- **Mar 23**: "With the Fed to the Rescue, Stocks Surge" — extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention and wild price swings
- **Mar 27**: Durable goods orders drop sharply (February) — Dow falls 110 points; disappointing to see 1.7% dip after strong durable goods demand (costly items like refrigerators, cars, computers); followed 5.3% January decline

- **Apr 2**: **BDO warns** "the loan losses are still to come" — losses from old bad loans just beginning
- **Apr 3**: **BDO**: "The real economy is still weak (close to zero growth) and still gaining momentum on the downside. Employment, production, demand, and investment are all weak and weakening."
- **Apr 4**: Unemployment rises after 80,000 jobs cut (manufacturing/construction lead decline — biggest in five years)
- **Apr 15**: Producer prices jump 1.1% (March) — Labor Department reports sharp acceleration from 0.3% February increase

- **Apr 30**: **Fed cuts 0.25%** for seventh time in seven months; signals pause from additional cuts
- **Apr 30**: **BDO**: "On Wednesday the Fed eased for what is priced in to be the last time in this easing cycle"

- **May 2**: Fed increases Term Auction Facility to $75B (from $50B)
- **May 9**: AIG CEO **Martin J. Sullivan** concedes company "badly underestimated the extent of the problems"
- **May 21**: **BDO on inflation vs. growth dilemma**: "The headaches for central bankers, and most investors for that matter, come when the growth and inflation aspects of the central banks' mandates give diverging signals...The recent market action and Fed rhetoric suggests there is growing concern about the divergence of growth and inflation"
- **June 2**: **BDO**: "Real events are starting to feed back onto financial events" — S&P cuts long-term debt ratings of Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman

- **June 5**: Moody's may downgrade MBIA/Ambac bond insurance arms — could cripple ability to write new insurance
- **June 7**: Oil/joblessness punish shares — worst losses in >2 months; crude spikes >$138, unemployment rises
- **June 9**: **BDO**: "Global shift in inflation expectations" — short rates hammered as central bankers emphasize inflation over growth
- **June 11**: Fed shifts focus to fighting inflation, leaving growth concerns behind
- **June 14**: Moody's reviews Lehman for possible downgrade (citing president/CFO demotion)
- **June 15**: Consumer Price Index rises at 4.2% annual rate (fastest in six months)

- **June 25**: **Consumer confidence drops to 16-year low**; home values fall in 20 metro areas

- **June 28**: Oil hits new high as Dow flirts with bear territory — 145-point Friday slide; Dow down 20% from Oct 9, 2007 high
- **June 30**: **BDO's major warning**:

> "Markets are tightening while the economy is deteriorating and financials are in free-fall...the tax refunds and a few other unsustainable sources of money have stabilized spending and the economy, market prices that directly impact the economy have responded in a way that is uniformly restrictive...the bounce in financial stocks that originally conveyed a more positive tone to the financial landscape has largely disappeared. Instead, deteriorating credit conditions in the real economy are feeding back onto the financial system, leaving behind a very big pile of financial institutions whose stock prices are in free-fall and whose market value of leverage is exploding. This high market value of leverage (assets divided by market cap) implies that on the margin, ever smaller declines in the value of their assets will wipe out ever larger chunks of equity value, the classic over-leveraged death spiral. Bigger losses lie ahead and the banking industry does not have enough healthy entities to absorb the dying ones. And, the sovereign wealth funds have lost their appetite for large doses of bank equity. The inadequacy of bank capital combined with the coming need to liquidate ever-larger portfolios of bank assets will further constrain credit growth in the economy."

- Reinforced concerns about US economy troubles
- Highlighted significant reliance on foreign investors, particularly Asia

**September 8, 2008 - BDO: GSE inevitability and Treasury delay**
> "At a big picture level, this is playing out in all the obvious ways... It was long ago inevitable that these GSEs were going to fail... And, it was inevitable that, when faced with this choice, the US government would stand behind its implied guarantee and defacto nationalize the GSE.... Given that the big picture was so obvious, what isn't obvious to us is why the Treasury waited so long before acting."

**September 9, 2008 - Lehman concerns trigger fresh jitters**

**September 10, 2008 - After sell-off, bargain hunters step in**

- Federal Reserve reversed course Tuesday: $84 billion bailout giving government control of **American International Group**
- Decision came only two weeks after Treasury took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
- **Most radical intervention in private business in central bank's history**

**September 16, 2008 - BDO: Fed's balance sheet as new safety net**
> "After allowing the system to go over the edge and seeing the avalanche begin, the safety net is now being quickly patched together via the Fed having to use its balance sheet because there is nothing else in its place. While this is exactly what we would have done if you put us in their position today, it's tragic that this is the position they are in both because the Fed should not be in this position and because it is not clear that taking these actions now will save the day at this late stage."

**September 17, 2008 - Financial crisis enters new phase**
- Many credit markets stopped working normally Wednesday
- Investors frantically moved money into safest investments like Treasury bills

**September 18, 2008 - Vast bailout proposed to stem financial crisis**

> "The Treasury, Fed, and Congress finally agreed to agree to build the safety net!!!! Overnight central banks added $180 billion in liquidity! Regulators moved against short sellers. Morgan Stanley was frozen and is about to be dealt with, and Goldman isn't far behind, but moves are in the works to deal with them."

### September 21-30, 2008: TARP Development and Market Turmoil

**September 21, 2008 - BDO: Treasury's disappointing move**
> "The newest move to contain the credit crisis (The 'Temporary Asset Relief Plan') is extraordinary in: 1) The breadth of the authority it gives the Treasury, and 2) The lack of specifics it provides. So, it doesn't engender confidence. In fact, on the heels of moves that both happened and didn't happen, it undermines our confidence."

**September 22, 2008 - Markets tumble amid bailout uncertainty**
- Fresh concerns about biggest government bailout in history
- Dollar weakening sparked frantic rush into commodities

**September 22, 2008 - BDO: What markets are saying**
> "The market action Monday for the most part was a disaster for US policy makers. US assets were abandoned, as stocks and treasury bonds declined while the dollar collapsed and commodities surged. This action is consistent with a loss of faith in the US as a reserve currency, and, if it continues, puts the US economy and financial system even more at risk."

**September 24, 2008 - Fed Chairman Bernanke warns**
- **Ben S. Bernanke** described nation's economy as barely limping along Wednesday
- Could buckle if financial institutions don't get $700 billion crutch from government

**September 26, 2008 - BDO: Fed continues liquidity fight, but not enough**
> "The big picture through which we see all the daily news is that we are in the avalanche phase of the deleveraging, and we suspect the steps being considered in Washington now are not nearly adequate to reverse the situation."

**September 28, 2008 - BDO: Plan pretty good, but timing question**
> "The plan allows the government all that we had hoped for in order to restore liquidity, solvency, and confidence, but it is not as forceful or as timely as we had hoped."

- Defying President Bush and leaders of both parties
- Rank-and-file lawmakers rejected plan in revolt that rocked Capitol

**September 29, 2008 - BDO: A credibility test**
> "Today's failure in the House of the bill, whose passage was assured by those supposedly in control, has shined the global spotlight on US decision makers. The question of whether the US can do what needs to get done has been further complicated. In the end, the world's financiers (China, OPEC) will decide whether US policy makers have passed the test."

**September 30, 2008 - Share recovery on bailout hopes**

### October 2008: TARP Passage and Continuing Deterioration

**October 3, 2008 - Bailout bill fails to reassure investors**

**October 3, 2008 - BDO: Horrible market action**
> "Price action around the TARP has been very bad, consistent with our view that the TARP won't be a game changer. Friday's price action in stocks held to the classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact pattern. Except that normally you get a big rally into good news and a selloff after the news is fact, culminating in a net gain...this time...the stock market traded to new lows after the vote became fact."

**October 3, 2008 - 159,000 jobs lost in September**, worst month in five years

**October 6, 2008 - Fed considers plan to buy companies' unsecured debt**

**October 7, 2008 - Markets plunge despite hint of rate cut**

**October 8, 2008 - BDO: Supply and illiquidity**
> "You've got increasing government supply with tight liquidity; dealers can't finance inventory, hedge funds can't borrow, foreigners are losing confidence in the dollar as a reserve currency, and the desire for cash is trumping all forms of risk, even the yield curve risk of a treasury bond."

**October 8, 2008 - AIG to get additional $37.8 billion**

**October 9, 2008 - Treasury considering cash injections into banks**
- Having tried without success to unlock frozen credit markets
- Considering taking ownership stakes in many US banks to restore confidence in financial system

- Congressional testimony: **Alan Greenspan** was marquee event for years
- Lawmakers doted on him as economic sage, markets jumped on his words
- Politicians wanted maestro on their side

- Bush administration examining range of options for emergency financial help
- Spur merger between **General Motors** and **Chrysler**
- Wanted to provide financial assistance to deeply troubled Big Three Detroit automakers
- Possibly using Treasury Department's wide-ranging authority under $700 billion bailout program

**October 27, 2008 - BDO: Fed continues pushing unprecedented liquidity**
> "The Fed continues to push unprecedented liquidity into the system across a variety of channels. The unprecedented push of liquidity has more than doubled the Fed's balance sheet by increasing their assets and liabilities by nearly a trillion dollars, but it has still not offset the private sector need. The world has accumulated so many dollar debts, and the ability to roll and grow these debts was so ingrained in the financial system's architecture, that the breakdown requires the unprecedented push from the Fed. Nonetheless, the risks the Fed faces in embarking on this course are numerous, and so much of the global financial system lays out of the Fed's reach."

**October 29, 2008 - Concerned Fed trims key rate by half point**

**October 29, 2008 - Zero percent interest rates possible**, some analysts say

**October 30, 2008 - Fed adds $21 billion to loans for AIG**

### November 2008: Obama Election and Continued Deterioration

**November 1, 2008 - BDO: Template for understanding what's going on**
> "We believe that the world economy is going through a deleveraging/depression process that will be quite painful for many people.... Contrary to popular thinking, a deleveraging/depression is not simply a severe version of a recession – it is an entirely different process."

**November 4, 2008 - Obama sweeps to historic victory**
- According to early exit poll data: 62% of voters said economy was top concern
- All other issues (terrorism, Iraq war) far behind
- With strong majorities in Congress, **President-elect Obama** likely to start fast with large economic-stimulus package

**November 7, 2008 - Jobless rate at 14-year high** after October losses

**November 7, 2008 - BDO: Creating liquidity but failing to create credit**
> "Essentially, through some asset purchases and a series of swaps, the Fed has exchanged T-bills for other more illiquid, lower grade and longer duration credits, and through the process has provided many key entities with short term liquidity. But it hasn't been able to get a privately-funded credit expansion going because it is uneconomic for creditors to lend, especially when they are squeezed. Without a credit expansion, the deleveraging/depression will continue until ultimately there will be a global debt restructuring (i.e., diminishing the size of creditors' claims on debtors)."

**November 10, 2008 - AIG secures $150 billion assistance package**

**November 10, 2008 - Fannie Mae loses $29 billion on write-downs**

**November 11, 2008 - Oil prices drop to 20-month low**

**November 11, 2008 - BDO: Thrilled with Fed's management**
> "While the Fed sowed the seeds of this crisis by allowing credit growth to be fast enough to cause rapid deteriorations in Americans' balance sheets (at first under Greenspan and then under Bernanke), and the Treasury allowed the deleveraging crisis to move beyond that which was manageable, the Fed behaved superbly once the deleveraging crisis became apparent to it, thereby mitigating the implosion in credit. It has quietly, imaginatively and aggressively redefined the optimal way that central banks should behave in depressions by essentially replacing, rather than relying on, impaired financial institutions to provide credit to key entities."

**November 12, 2008 - Major indexes fall sharply**
- Financial markets had traded all morning but began sharp slide just before **Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.** appeared at news conference
- Discussed $700 billion financial bailout package
- Government assets would NOT go to buying troubled securities as originally planned
- Instead: buying stock in banks and infusing money into other financial institutions

**November 13, 2008 - BDO: Understanding the changing plans for TARP**
> "Paulson's statements Wednesday and Thursday show another shift in the plans for the use of the TARP. The shift away from directly buying mortgage assets (unlevered) to injecting more capital into banks and now working on other mechanisms that further lever the funds outside the banking system via potentially guaranteeing new securitization vehicles make sense to us."

**November 17, 2008 - Need for bankruptcies and risks of preventing them**
- BDO analysis: Economy's most basic problem is that many individuals' and companies' debt service payments are too large relative to cash flows they produce
- As a result, must go through debt restructurings writing down debts to levels reducing required debt service payments to levels consistent with debtors' abilities to pay
- **Bankruptcy is the most common way of bringing about these restructurings**
- The more bankruptcies we have, and sooner we have them, the quicker we can get this economic crisis behind us

**November 19, 2008 - Stocks drop sharply and credit markets seize up**
- **S&P 500** fell 6.7%, leaving benchmark down about 52% from October 2007 peak

**November 20, 2008 - New jobless claims reach 16-year high**

**November 20, 2008 - Oil closes below $50**, lowest price since May 2005

**November 21, 2008 - BDO: The balance sheet problem**
> "The thaw in credit markets since the Fed decided to inject equity into banks has been insufficient in preventing the avalanche of credit market selling. The freeze that continues in credit markets is evidenced by the breakdown of basic financing relationships in markets that once taken for granted as arbitrages when financing was available. The economy will be in free fall until new credit is available at rates that make sense given economic conditions, and new credit is unlikely to be made available at such rates while there are so many dislocations to take advantage of first. Today, there is just no willingness to use up balance sheet (create credit) for even arbitrages, much less the financing of new economic activity."

**November 25, 2008 - Fed details $800 billion loan plans**
- Mortgage markets electrified by Fed announcement it would swoop in and buy up to $600 billion in debt tied to mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
- Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell almost a full percentage point, to 5.5% from 6.3%

**November 28, 2008 - Wall Street caps 5-session rally**
- Biggest five-day rally in more than 75 years
- Even as investors digested signs of bleak holiday season for retailers
- Stock market closed three hours early after Thanksgiving
- Locked in gains of 16.9% for Dow since rally began November 21
- **S&P 500** up 19.1%

### December 2008-February 2009: Deepening Recession

**December 17, 2008 - OPEC agrees to another cut in production**

**December 17, 2008 - Fed flattens rates, dollar bruised**

**December 18, 2008 - BDO: How investors lost money in 2008 & lessons**
From BDO perspective, most investors lost money because:
1. Much more exposure to beta than alpha
2. Beta exposure much more heavily in assets that do badly during economic bad times (stocks, real estate, bonds with credit risk) than assets that do well in bad times (Treasury bonds)
3. Risk and liquidity premiums rose a lot (happens in bad times)
4. Alphas typically had systematic biases to do well in good times and badly in bad times
- Average "hedge" fund been about 70% correlated with stocks
- Not surprising hedge funds down a lot when stocks down a lot

**December 30, 2008 - GMAC makes it easier to get a car loan**
- Would begin making loans immediately to borrowers with credit scores of 621 or higher (significant easing from 700 minimum score required two months ago)
- Would offer new round of low-rate financing, including zero percent interest on some models

### January-March 2009: Obama Administration Takes Office

**January 2, 2009 - Manufacturing reports show depth of global downturn**
- US manufacturing activity fell to lowest level in 28 years in December
- **Institute for Supply Management** manufacturing index: 32.4 in December, down from 36.2 in November

**January 4, 2009 - Auto industry damage from 2008**
- Each of six largest automakers expected to say US sales fell at least 30% in December

**January 5, 2009 - BDO: Putting the stimulus plan in perspective**
> "Our estimates suggest the lack of both supply and demand for credit will create a hole in the economy that is around $1.2 trillion, and that at least based on what we know now, the government stimulus in 2009 will offset only about 1/3 of that."

**January 9, 2009 - Jobless report sends shares tumbling**
- Stocks slid on news unemployment rates hit highest levels in 16 years as economy slipped further into recession

>
> At the big picture level, events are transpiring in the very classic way that happens in depressions and that is outlined in our 'Template for Understanding What's Going On,' except the Fed is undertaking these things earlier in the process than is typical. Those who run the Fed are clearly trying to prevent the debt restructuring phase and go directly to the credit creation phase by doing all the classic debt relief things now. So are the folks in the administration. In addition to printing money, these will include initiatives to encourage credit creation (e.g. TALF, PPIF, etc.), and accounting and regulatory forbearance."

- **BDO observation**: Long-term debt cycles transpire slowly over a lifetime
- Most people haven't experienced many, unlike business cycles
> "We suspect that the most important difference between our views and others concerns the long-term debt cycle. As long-term debt cycles transpire slowly—essentially over a lifetime—most people haven't experienced many of them, unlike the business cycle which most of us have seen many of. So, while recessions are well understood, deleveragings are not well understood." –*BDO*

**July 29, 2010** - **More Will Likely Be Necessary From the Fed**
- **BDO**: Monetization should not be viewed as light switch
- Should be viewed like spigot controlling flow in degrees
- Works similar to interest rate cuts or putting foot on car accelerator
- Judge right amount by watching reactions
> "When doing either, you judge the right amount primarily by watching the reactions. When things start to pick up, you start to let off. When things start to slow down, you start to press the pedal harder." –*BDO*

**August 10, 2010** - **Fed Move on Debt Signals Concern About Economy**

- ECB "normalizing" its balance sheet (letting longer-term lending facilities roll off, decreasing asset purchases)
- **Pushing up short-term interest rates and the euro**
> "This de facto tightening of monetary policy seems like a mistake to us, and we suspect will cause conditions to deteriorate (likely further pressuring peripheral credits) and eventually cause the ECB to reverse course (pushing down rates and probably the euro)." –*BDO*

> "As you know, we divide the world into debtors and creditors, and we divide each of these groups into those with independent monetary policies and those with linked monetary policies. We believe that debtors with linked monetary policies (i.e., who can't print money) will experience many years of hardship and economic weakness, and that creditors who can't stop printing money because they have linked exchange rates will go through an extended period of overheating." –*BDO*

## Glossary of Key Economic Terms

### Balance of Payments and Currency Terms

- **Balance of payments**: Net transactions (goods, services, financial assets, payments) between a country/currency and rest of world
  - Worsening balance of payments = inflows decline relative to expenditures (like family financial condition deteriorating)
  - Improving balance of payments = reverse dynamic

- **Balance-of-payments crisis**: Country entities lack adequate buying power in world markets to meet needs; essentially run out of cash and credit

- **Capital inflows/outflows**: Cross-border money/credit movement for capital/investment assets (bonds, currency, equities, factories)
  - Foreigners buying/selling country's assets = 'inflows'
  - Domestic players buying/selling foreign assets = 'outflows'

- **Currency peg**: Exchange rate policy fixing currency value to another currency, currency mix, or asset (e.g., gold)

- **Current account balance**: Exports minus imports plus net income receipts
  - Essentially net income (income minus expenses)
  - Deficit means expenses exceed income, requiring capital transactions (borrowing/selling equity) to make up difference

- **FX (Foreign exchange)**: Exchange rate between currencies

- **FX debt**: Debt denominated in currency other than investor's home country

- **Real FX**: Imprecise measure of currency cheapness/expensiveness based on relative currency and price levels versus past
  - Positive real FX = more expensive currency
  - Negative = cheaper currency
  - Usually measured versus trade partners (trade-weighted index/TWI)

- **Reserves**: Country's holding of foreign currency/gold savings used to make purchases and affect supply, demand, price of own currency

### Debt and Crisis Terms

- **Bubble**: Self-reinforcing, unsustainable rises in debt, asset prices, growth
  - Key word: "unsustainable" — temporary boom conditions followed by bust
  - Like borrowing heavily for expensive lifestyle; continues near-term but unsustainable, results in bad times when adjustment happens

- **Depression**: Severe economic downturn with self-reinforcing declines in asset prices and growth
  - Most classically occurs when central banks limited in ability to ease monetary policy

- **Debt service**: Cost of maintaining debts over given period (interest + principal payments)

- **Deleveraging**: Process of reducing debt burdens

- **Deleveraging attribution**: **Bridgewater analysis** decomposing debt burden changes
  - Black dot = annualized change in debt as % of GDP over period (positive = increased debt, negative = decreased)
  - Shows factors that increased debt burdens (above 0) and decreased burdens (below 0)
  - Displays GDP factors (inflation, real growth) and debt factors (borrowing to cover interest/new borrowing)
  - **Note**: Attribution methodology differs between countries based on data availability

### Growth and Economic Measurement

- **GDP (Gross domestic product)**: Total value (price × quantity) of all final goods/services produced in country
  - Most common means of representing economy size
  - Other economic concepts often expressed as % of GDP for context

- **GDP gap**: Imprecise measure of whether economy operates at high/low capacity
  - Based on difference between current production vs. sustainable level over longer period (economy's "potential")
  - Negative GDP gap = slack (e.g., factories not at full capacity)
  - Positive GDP gap = very little slack
  - Often called "output gap" or "slack"

- **Nominal growth**: Change in value (price × quantity) of what country produces (GDP)
  - "Nominal" = includes inflation cases, as opposed to real growth

- **Real growth**: Imprecise measure of change in quantity of goods/services produced (inflation-adjusted, not nominal)

- **Real GDP**: Imprecise measure of quantity of goods/services produced (vs. total value influenced by inflation)

- **Potential**: Imprecise measure of production level economy can sustain when operating near capacity
  - GDP gap represents whether current production higher/lower than potential

### Inflation and Interest Rates

- **Core inflation**: Inflation excluding especially volatile goods (e.g., commodities)

- **Real interest rates**: Interest rates adjusted to remove inflation effects
  - Negative real interest rate = inflation exceeds interest earned, meaning lenders lose buying power over time

- **Liquidity**: Measure of money/credit scarcity vs. ready availability
  - Low liquidity = money/credit scarce, creditworthy borrowers pay higher rates
  - High liquidity = creditworthy borrowers borrow easily at lower rates

- **Long rate**: Interest rates on longer-term debt (typically 10-year government bond yield shown)

- **Short rate**: Interest rates on lending for very short periods (usually 3 months or less)

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy

- **Easing/Stimulation**: Central bank monetary policy or government fiscal policy making money/credit more available
  - Methods: lowering interest rates, printing money, changing regulations, changing spending/taxation/regulations

- **Tightening**: Policy reducing money/credit availability, slowing economic growth
  - Methods: increasing interest rates, allowing money supplies to shrink, cutting government spending, changing rules to restrict bank lending

- **Fiscal balance**: Whether government spending exceeds tax revenue
  - Deficit = spending exceeds earnings (must borrow or spend down savings)
  - Surplus = earning more than spending

- **Money 0 (M0)**: Total amount of printed money in currency
  - Based on physical currency in circulation plus reserves held at central bank
  - Also referred to as M0

- **Reflation**: Instances when monetary policy easy/stimulative and helps produce economic recovery

### Yield Curve

- **Yield curve**: Difference between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates
  - Inverted yield curve = short rates above longer-term rates (short-term rates priced to fall)
  - Normal = short rates below longer-term rates (short-term rates priced to rise)

## United States 1926-1936 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase (1926-1929)

- **Classic deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1926-1936

- Self-reinforcing cycle: rising debt + strong equity returns + strong growth
- **Debt peaked at 125% of GDP** (pre-crisis)
  - Debt in domestic currency, majority domestically owned
- Growth strong at 3%; economic activity high (GDP gap peaked at 13%)
- **Equities averaged 31% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Policy makers initiated moderate tightening (short rates rising ~250 bps)
- Bubble pressures + tightening money/credit = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1929-1933)

- Dynamic turned → self-reinforcing bust and "ugly deleveraging" (1929-1933)

- High debt levels left US vulnerable to shock: **1929 stock market crash**

- **Self-reinforcing declines**:
  - GDP fell 26%
  - Stock prices fell 84%
  - Home prices fell 24%
  - Unemployment increased 23%

- Financial institutions under considerable pressure

- **Paradox**: Even though US needed deleveraging, debt as % GDP rose 98% (26% annualized)
  - Driven by falling real incomes, deflation, interest payments financed with new debt

- **Deleveraging attribution chart** composition:
  - Mix of falling real incomes, deflation, interest payments financed with new debt drove debt/GDP increase

### The Reflation Phase (1933-1936)

- After longer-than-average bust, policy makers provided enough stimulation for "beautiful" deleveraging/reflation (began 1933)

- **Monetary policy**:
  - Government broke peg to gold
  - M0 increased 6% of GDP
  - Interest rates pushed down to 0%
  - Real FX averaged -5% during stimulative phase

- **Aggressive financial institution management**: Pulled 8 out of 9 classic policy levers
  - Provided liquidity
  - Directly purchased troubled assets

- Stimulation brought nominal growth well above nominal interest rates
  - Growth averaged 8% during period
  - Sovereign long rates fell to 3%

- **Unemployment** declined 14%

- **Debt as % GDP fell 70%** (21% annualized) per attribution chart

- **"Beautiful" period mechanics**: Debt-to-income ratio reduction driven primarily by rising real incomes, secondarily by inflation

- **Recovery timeline**:
  - 7 years before real GDP reached prior peak
  - Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 25 years

### Political Impact

- Crisis had notable impact on US politics
- Set stage for **FDR** (considered populist leader) to take power

### Chart Deck Components

**Gauges** (rough measures of bubble/depression conditions and monetary tightness/easiness):
- Difference from zero = extent of bubble

**Bubble & Depression Gauge**: Shows bubble peak 1929, depression trough ~1934, reflation recovery through 1939

**Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Peak tightening 1929, peak easing ~1934-1935

**Core Inflation (Y/Y)**: Fluctuated 0-4% pre-crash, plunged to -10% by 1933, recovered to 4% by late 1930s

**Indebtedness Charts**:
- Total Debt peaked ~125% GDP (1933), Debt Service peaked ~225% GDP
- FX Debt: No data available
- Change in Debt-GDP Ratio: Spiked to +30% annualized ~1933, fell to -20% during reflation

**Monetary and Fiscal Policy**:

## United Kingdom 1927–1936: Deflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Cycle

- UK experienced **classic deflationary deleveraging** 1927-1936
- Unlike other cases, UK lacked broad-based domestic bubble but was **tied to other economies experiencing bubble conditions**
- Built substantial debt stock: **210% of GDP** before crisis
- Debt denominated in **domestic currency**, majority owned domestically
- Shock came externally: ripples from **US stock crash** and early Great Depression

### The Bubble Phase (Pre-1929)

#### Limited Domestic Bubble, High Debt Vulnerability

- No broad-based bubble in UK itself
- Connected to other markets with bubble-like conditions
- Debt reached 210% of GDP—a critical vulnerability threshold
- Debt composition: domestic currency, domestically owned

### The Depression Phase (1929-1931)

#### "Ugly Deleveraging" Dynamics

- Depression ran 1929-1931: **self-reinforcing bust**
- External shock: US stock crash + early Great Depression
- **GDP fell 10%**
- **Stock prices fell 61%**
- **Unemployment rose 7%**

#### Debt-to-GDP Paradox During Depression

- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt/GDP rose 13%** (6% annualized)
- Primary drivers:
  - **Interest payments** financed with new debt (main driver)
  - **Falling real incomes** (secondary factor)
- Partially offset by paying down existing debt
- Depression attribution shows interest + monetization dominated the debt increase

### The Reflation Phase (1931-1936)

#### Policy Response: Breaking the Gold Peg

- Policymakers achieved **"beautiful deleveraging"** after shorter-than-average bust
- Key monetary policy: **broke peg to gold**
- **M0 increased 2% of GDP**
- **Interest rates pushed to 0%**
- **Real FX depreciated -8%** during stimulative phase

#### Policy Effectiveness: 1 Out of 9 Levers

- UK **not aggressive** in managing financial institutions and bad debts
- Used only **1 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- Other stimulative measures helped bring nominal growth above nominal rates

#### Recovery Outcomes

- **Nominal growth averaged 4%** during reflation period
- **Sovereign long rates fell to 3%**
- **Unemployment declined 8%**
- **Debt/GDP fell 29%** (5% annualized)

#### Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period

- Primary driver: **paying down existing debt**
- Secondary: **rising real incomes**
- Partially offset by: **interest payments financed with new debt**
- Took **5 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD** recovered within **8 years**

### Gauges and Metrics

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge

- Composite measure of bubble/depression conditions + money/credit tightness
- Pre-crisis: moderate bubble reading (~0.5)
- 1929-1931: sharp drop to peak depression (~-3.0)
- Post-1931: gradual reflation back toward zero

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge

- Pre-crisis: peak tightening conditions (~1.0+)
- Crisis period: sharp easing
- 1934: reached **peak easing** (~-1.0)
- Then gradual return toward neutral

### Chart Deck Data Summary

#### Indebtedness

- Total debt peaked ~210% GDP (1929)
- Debt service peaked ~25% GDP (1929)
- Both metrics declined steadily through reflation phase
- No FX debt data available for this period

#### Monetary and Fiscal Policy

- **Nominal short rate**: fell from 7% peak to <1% by mid-1930s
- **Money (M0) level**: increased from ~12% GDP to ~14% GDP
- **Fiscal balance**: positive surplus throughout (~1-2% GDP), gradually declining

#### Economic Conditions

- **Real GDP**: V-shaped recovery, surpassed pre-crisis level by 1934
- **GDP gap**: -10% trough in 1932, recovered to near-zero by 1936
- **Core inflation**: highly volatile, -4% to +5% range, turned positive mid-1930s
- **Nominal growth vs. long rate**: growth initially collapsed below rates, then recovered above by mid-1930s

#### Markets

- **Equity prices (USD)**: 61% decline trough-to-peak, recovered to ~70 by 1939 (from ~110 peak)

## Japan 1925–1936 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase

- **No broad-based domestic bubble**: Unlike many other cases, Japan didn't experience a broad-based bubble domestically, but was tied to other countries experiencing bubble-like conditions
- **Substantial debt buildup**: Debts reached **65% of GDP** prior to crisis
- **Domestic currency debt**: Debt was in Japan's domestic currency, and majority owned domestically
- Connected to global bubble dynamics despite lack of internal speculation

### The Depression Phase

#### The Trigger and Initial Decline (1927-1931)

- **"Ugly deleveraging" period**: Ran from 1927 to 1931
- **1929 global stock crash as shock**: High debt levels left Japan vulnerable when the global market crashed
- **GDP declined 4%**, stock prices fell **47%**
- **Financial institutions under pressure**: Banking system came under considerable stress
- **Debt-to-GDP paradox**: Despite needing deleveraging, debt as % GDP rose **36% (8% annualized)** during depression
  - Debt service burdens increased even as real economy contracted
  - Denominator effect: GDP falling faster than debt reduction

#### Policy Response Metrics

- Japan pulled **3 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- Gauges measured bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit
- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: Shows shift from modest bubble phase through depression into reflation
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Shows peak tightening at crisis onset, then shift to easing during reflation

### The Reflation Phase

#### Policy Intervention (1931 onward)

- **Longer than average bust phase** before successful policy response
- **"Beautiful deleveraging"**: Policymakers provided enough stimulus to turn depression into reflation starting 1931
- **Gold standard abandoned**: Government broke peg to gold
- **Interest rates cut to 2%**
- **Real FX averaged -26%** during stimulative phase (currency depreciation)
- **Somewhat aggressive** in managing financial institutions and bad debts

#### Economic Recovery

- **Nominal growth exceeded nominal interest rates**: Growth averaged **4.7%**, sovereign long rates fell to **3.9%**
- **Debt-to-GDP fell 18% (4% annualized)** during reflation period
- **Deleveraging mechanism**: Reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from **income rising** (higher real growth), not from nominal debt reduction
- Reflation created positive growth dynamics that allowed debt burdens to fall naturally

#### Political Consequences

- Crisis helped set stage for **Hideki Tojo** to take power
- Tojo considered a **populist leader** by many
- Economic crisis influenced Japan's political trajectory toward militarism

### Deleveraging Attribution Charts

**Depression Period (1927-1931)**:
- Real growth: negative (contractionary)
- Inflation: positive but insufficient
- Change in domestic debt: large positive contributor

**Reflation Period (1931-1936)**:
- Real growth: large positive contributor (blue)
- Inflation: large positive contributor (red/pink)
- Change in domestic debt: positive contributor (green)
- Net result: Debt %GDP fell **-4% annualized**

### Chart Deck Data Highlights

- **Real growth Y/Y**: Volatile, ranging from +8% peaks to -6% trough
- **Core inflation Y/Y**: Volatile between -15% and +8%, with severe deflation at crisis trough, then reflation to +5-8%
- **Nominal growth vs nominal long rate**: Crossed in 1931 when growth exceeded rates, enabling deleveraging

#### Markets
- **Equity prices (USD, indexed)**: Climbed to ~100 (1929), crashed to ~40 (1932), recovered to ~75 (1937)
- **Yield curve (SR-LR)**: Flattened from +4% spread to near-flat/-2% by reflation phase

- **Imports %GDP**: Fell from ~25% to ~15% during depression
- **Exports %GDP**: Fell from ~20% to ~10% during depression
- **Current account %GDP**: Persistent deficits of -5% to -7% through most of period, improved during reflation
- Capital flow data: Not available

### Key Insights

- Classic example of how **breaking a currency peg** (gold standard) can enable reflation
- Demonstrates that **deleveraging works best through growth**, not austerity
- Shows danger of **debt denominator effect**: debt ratios worsen during contraction even if absolute debt stable
- Political instability often follows severe economic crises
- Currency depreciation was critical tool for restoring competitiveness and growth

## France 1926–1938 (continued)

### Gauges and Measurements

- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: Composite statistical measure tracking bubble/depression conditions
  - Distance from zero indicates extent of bubble
  - Crossing above/below zero shows transition into/out of bubble phase
  - France showed bubble peak in 1929, followed by sustained depression through mid-1930s

- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Tracks monetary/credit conditions
  - Peak tightening occurred at 1929 crisis onset
  - "Peak Easing" reached ~1937, indicating most accommodative point

### Deleveraging Attribution: Depression Period (1929-1936)

- **Real growth contribution**: Modest positive (blue bar)
- **Inflation contribution**: Major negative drag (pink bar) — deflation hurt deleveraging
- **Change in domestic debt**: Largest positive contributor (green bar) — debt reduction of ~6-8% of GDP
- **Net debt %GDP change**: +1% despite deleveraging needs
- Key insight: Deflation prevented effective deleveraging despite debt reduction efforts

### The Reflation Phase (1936 onwards)

**Monetary Policy Shifts**:
- Government **broke the peg to gold** (devaluation)
- Interest rates pushed down to **2%**
- Real FX averaged **-4%** during stimulative phase (currency depreciation)

**Inflation as Deleveraging Tool**:
- Policymakers **allowed inflation to run high** — averaged **10%** during this period
- High inflation boosted nominal growth and reduced domestic debt burden
- France pulled **3 out of 9 classic policy levers** for financial institution/bad debt management

**Nominal Growth Above Interest Rates**:
- Growth averaged **15%** during reflation period
- Sovereign long rates fell to **4%**
- Positive carry (growth > rates) enabled debt reduction

**Deleveraging Results (Reflation Period 1936-1938)**:
- Debt/GDP fell **37%** (**15% annualized**)
- Attribution chart shows:
  - **Inflation** (pink): Massive negative contribution (-35% to -40%) — inflating away debt
  - **Real growth** (blue): Small positive (~-5% to 0%)
  - **Change in domestic debt** (green): Positive contribution (~20%)
  - Net **-15%** debt/GDP ratio improvement

> "Throughout this 'beautiful' period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher inflation."

- Recovery took **21 years** before real GDP reached prior peak

### Political Impact

- Crisis helped **Leon Blum** (described as populist leader) take power in 1936
- Economic distress drove political transformation

## United Kingdom 1941–1967 Case Auto-Summary

### Overview

**Classic wartime deflationary deleveraging** between 1941-1967:
- War winners experience brief postwar recession as economy transitions from war production
- Followed by more orderly deleveraging process

### The War Phase (1941-1943)

**Unusual Characteristics**:
- Debt crisis rooted in **WW2 financing**, not bubble dynamics
- UK borrowed heavily to finance large fiscal deficit
- Economy shifted to war production
- Workforce shifted to armed services and war production
- "Economic stats are not reflective of typical economic linkages"

**Debt Structure**:
- Debt denominated in **UK's domestic currency** (pound sterling)
- Majority **owned domestically**
- Provides more policy flexibility

**Economic Performance**:
- **Real growth**: Strong at **6%** (aided by wartime spending)
- **GDP gap**: Peaked at **10%** above potential
- **Equity returns**: Averaged **16% annualized** during war period
- Strong asset returns stimulated growth despite war conditions

### The Postwar Phase (1943-1947)

**Recession Dynamics**:
- Postwar recession ran **1943 to 1947**
- Less severe than for war losers
- Economy transitioned away from war production

**Self-Reinforcing Decline**:
- GDP fell **15%** during postwar adjustment
- Attribution chart shows even though UK needed deleveraging:
  - **Debt/GDP went UP 102%** (**25% annualized**)
  - Incomes declined
  - Government shouldered war-related costs
  - Peak fiscal deficit: **31% of GDP** during "ugly period"

**Gauges**:
- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: War boom peak followed by postwar retooling trough, then reflation
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Peak tightening during war, peak easing ~1948
- Composite measures track credit/monetary conditions

### The Reflation Phase (1947 onwards)

**Monetary Policy**:
- Currency devalued versus gold by **30%**
- **M0 actually decreased 8%** of GDP (unusual for reflation)
- Interest rates pushed down to **1%**
- Real FX averaged **-10%** during stimulative phase

**Inflation Strategy**:
- Policymakers **allowed inflation to run high** — averaged **4%**
- Boosted nominal growth
- Reduced domestic debt burden

**Stimulative Measures**:
- Brought **nominal growth well above nominal interest rates**
- Growth averaged **7%** during period
- Sovereign long rates fell to **2%**
- Unemployment rates remained flat

**Deleveraging Results**:
- Debt/GDP fell **139%** (**7% annualized**)
- Attribution chart shows:
  - Reduction came **mostly from income rising**
  - Driven **primarily by inflation**

<!-- pp. 661-680 -->

## United Kingdom 1941-1967 Case Study

### Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period (1947-1967)

- **Debt reduction mechanics**: UK debt/GDP fell -7% over 1947-1967 period
- Debt reduction came from three components:
  - Real growth contribution (blue): positive contributor to deleveraging
  - Inflation contribution (red/pink): significant negative real rates eroded debt burden
  - Change in domestic debt (green): actual reduction in nominal debt levels
- **Recovery timeline**: took 10 years before real GDP reached prior peak
- Context: Post-WWII deleveraging through combination of growth and inflation

## United States 1943-1951 Case Study

### War Phase (1941-1945)

- **Atypical debt crisis**: unlike typical bubble-driven crises, rooted in WWII financing needs
- **Debt buildup**: government borrowed heavily to finance large fiscal deficits
- Economic structure shifted massively toward war production and armed services deployment
- **Debt levels**: rose to 150% GDP during war
- **Currency denomination**: debt in US domestic currency, majority owned domestically
- **Growth environment**: strong growth at 13% annual aided by wartime spending
- **Economic activity**: GDP gap peaked at 19% (overheated wartime economy)
- **Asset returns**: equities averaged 15% annualized returns during war period, helping stimulate growth

> "For these reasons, the economic stats are not reflective of typical economic linkages."

### Postwar Phase (1945-1950)

- **Recession timeline**: US entered postwar recession 1945-1950 after fighting ended
- **Winner advantage**: postwar slump less severe than for war losers
- **GDP contraction**: self-reinforcing declines, GDP fell 13%
- **Unemployment**: rose 5 percentage points
- **Debt dynamics**: debt as % GDP roughly flat through postwar period despite need for deleveraging
- Attribution chart shows inflation and real growth roughly offset, leaving debt/GDP stable

**Deleveraging Attribution: Depression Period (1945-1950)**:
- Real growth (blue): negative contribution as economy contracted
- Inflation (red): positive but moderate
- Change in domestic debt (green): largest component - actual debt increase of ~10% GDP
- Net result: debt/GDP rose ~2% over period

- **Policy success**: "beautiful" deleveraging achieved through sufficient stimulation
- **Timeline**: reflation began 1950 after relatively long bust phase
- **Monetary policy**:
  - M0 actually decreased 0.9% of GDP during stimulative phase
  - Interest rates pushed down to 1% during stimulative phase
- **Growth outcomes**:
  - Nominal growth averaged 11% during reflation period
  - Sovereign long rates averaged 2%
  - Growth well above interest rates enabled debt reduction
- **Employment**: unemployment declined 2 percentage points
- **Debt reduction**: debt/GDP fell 22% (14% annualized)

**Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period (1950-1951)**:
- Real growth (blue): large positive contribution to deleveraging
- Inflation (red): large positive contribution (negative real rates)
- Change in domestic debt (green): positive contribution from nominal debt increase of ~10% GDP
- Net result: debt/GDP fell -14% over period

> "Throughout this 'beautiful' period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth."

- **Recovery timeline**: took 6 years before real GDP reached prior peak

**Central bank strategy**: stayed easy even as activity picked up sharply - accommodative policy brought nominal growth well above nominal interest rates

## Norway 1984–1996 Case Study

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Deleveraging Cycle
- Norway experienced a **deflationary deleveraging cycle** from 1984 to 1996
- Three distinct phases: bubble (1984-1987), depression (1987-1992), reflation (1992-1996)
- Full cycle demonstrates typical debt crisis dynamics in a developed economy with its own currency

### The Bubble Phase (1984-1987)

#### Characteristics of the Bubble
- **Self-reinforcing cycle** of strong growth, strong equity returns, and strong housing returns
- Debt reached pre-crisis peak of **211% of GDP**
- Debt denominated in **domestic currency**, majority owned domestically
- Investment inflows averaged **4% of GDP**, financing current account deficit of 2% of GDP

#### Economic Conditions During Bubble
- Strong growth at **3%** annually
- High levels of economic activity: **GDP gap peaked at 5%**
- Strong asset returns: **housing prices averaged 19% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Capital inflows enabled strong growth alongside current account deficit

#### Policy Response During Bubble
- Policymakers initiated **large tightening**: short rates rose **~700 bps**
- Bubble pressures + tightening money and credit = unsustainable situation
- Despite policy tightening, bubble dynamics continued to strengthen

### The Depression Phase (1987-1992)

#### The Turn and Triggering Shock
- Dynamic eventually turned, producing **"ugly deleveraging"** from 1987-1992
- Debt service reached **58% of GDP** at pre-crisis peak — extremely vulnerable position
- Shock came via **ripples from commodity price declines**
- Norway as commodity exporter particularly exposed to this external shock

#### Depression Dynamics
- **Self-reinforcing declines** in GDP (falling 4%) and home prices (falling 38%)
- Financial institutions came under **considerable pressure**
- Despite need for deleveraging, **debt as % GDP roughly flat** through this period
- Classic case where debt burden doesn't decline despite economic contraction

#### Attribution of Depression Period
- Chart shows deleveraging components: real growth (negative), inflation (negative), change in domestic debt (positive)
- **Debt %GDP stayed at 0%** — no net deleveraging occurred
- Negative real growth and deflation offset by continued debt accumulation

### Policy Response and Gauges

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge
- Composite measure showing bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit
- Difference from zero shows extent of bubble; crossing zero represents shifting into/out of bubble
- Gauge peaked at **~2.5** during 1987 bubble peak
- Fell to **-1.5** trough during 1992 depression bottom
- Clear cyclical pattern from bubble to depression to reflation

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge
- Shows monetary policy stance throughout cycle
- **Peak tightening** occurred around 1987 (at bubble peak)
- **Peak easing** occurred around 1992 (at depression bottom)
- Second tightening peak around 1992 as recovery began
- Gauge range: approximately +1.0 (tightening) to -1.5 (easing)

#### Core Inflation Dynamics
- High inflation during bubble: peaked around **10-11%** in mid-1980s
- Declined through bubble period to **~6%** by 1987
- Continued falling through depression: reached **~4%** by 1992
- Further declined during reflation to near **0%** by 1997
- Total decline of ~10 percentage points over full cycle

### The Reflation Phase (1992-1996)

#### Turning the Depression into "Beautiful Deleveraging"
- After relatively long bust phase, policymakers provided **enough stimulation** to turn deleveraging into beautiful one
- Period of **reflation** began in 1992
- Required aggressive policy response across multiple levers

#### Monetary Policy Response
- **M0 increased by 2% of GDP**
- Interest rates ultimately **pushed down to 4%**
- **Real FX averaged 3% depreciation** during stimulative phase
- Brought nominal growth close to nominal interest rates

#### Financial Sector Management (4 out of 9 classic policy levers)
- **Nationalized banks** and provided liquidity
- Aggressive management of financial institutions and bad debts
- Structural approach rather than just monetary stimulus

#### Structural Reforms
- Enacted reforms designed to **increase labor market flexibility**
- Complemented monetary and financial policies
- Supported long-term recovery beyond immediate crisis response

#### Reflation Results
- Nominal growth averaged **6.1%** during this period
- Sovereign long rates fell to **5.5%**
- **Unemployment rates declined by 4%**
- **Debt as % of GDP fell by 35%** (7% annualized)
- Took **5 years** before real GDP reached its prior peak

#### Attribution of Reflation Period
- Chart shows deleveraging components: real growth (blue), inflation (pink), change in domestic debt (green)
- **Debt %GDP declined -7%** overall
- Reduction came **mostly from income rising** (combination of real growth and inflation)
- Real growth was primary driver of deleveraging
- Some contribution from inflation
- Change in domestic debt showed modest positive contribution (green bar)

### Key Lessons from Norway Case

#### Vulnerability Creation
- High debt service ratios (58% of GDP) create extreme vulnerability to shocks
- Commodity-dependent economies face additional risk from price volatility
- Domestic currency debt doesn't eliminate crisis risk if debt levels high enough

#### Depression Dynamics
- Deleveraging doesn't automatically occur during depression — debt %GDP can stay flat
- Self-reinforcing negative dynamics affect both real economy and asset prices
- Financial system stress compounds economic contraction

#### Successful Reflation Requirements
- Comprehensive policy response: monetary + financial sector + structural
- All 4 classic levers pulled: nationalization, liquidity provision, rate cuts, FX depreciation
- Labor market reforms complement demand-side policies
- Income growth (not debt reduction) was primary deleveraging mechanism
- Recovery takes time: 5 years to return to prior GDP peak
- Sustained commitment required: 4-year reflation phase (1992-1996) to achieve results

- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing and stimulated growth
- Policymakers initiated **large monetary tightening** with short rates rising ~700 bps
- **Competitiveness became an issue** as real FX peaked at +24%
- Bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + tightening money/credit = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1989-1993)

- Reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from **income rising**, driven by higher real growth
- Took **7 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Equity prices in USD terms **recovered within 5 years**

### Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period (1993-2001)

Breakdown of 8% annualized debt/GDP decrease:

## Sweden 1987-2000 Case Study

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- **Sweden** experienced a **classic deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1987 and 2000
- Three distinct phases: bubble (1987-1990), depression (1990-1993), reflation (1993-2000)
- Comprehensive case study with economic conditions, markets, and external position data

### The Bubble Phase (1987-1990)

#### Debt Dynamics
- **Debts rose 15% of GDP** during bubble, reaching pre-crisis peak of **239% of GDP**
- Debt denominated in **domestic currency**, majority **owned domestically**
- **Debt service reached 65% of GDP** at pre-crisis peak, creating extreme vulnerability

#### Economic Activity
- **Self-reinforcing cycle**: rising debt → strong growth → strong housing returns
- Growth moderate at **2%**, but economic activity high (**GDP gap peaked at 4%**)
- Investment inflows low but positive, averaging **~2% of GDP**
- Current account deficit of **3% of GDP**

#### Monetary Policy and Competitiveness
- Policymakers initiated **large tightening** — short rates rose **~500 bps**
- **Competitiveness became an issue**: Sweden's real FX peaked at **+15%**
- Tightening money and credit combined with bubble pressures created **unsustainable situation**

### The Depression Phase (1990-1993)

#### The Trigger
- Dynamic turned, producing **self-reinforcing bust** and **"ugly deleveraging"**
- Shock came via **housing price declines hitting bank solvency**
- Sweden suffered from **self-reinforcing declines** across multiple dimensions

#### Economic Contraction
- **GDP fell 6%**
- **Stock prices fell 34%**
- **Home prices fell 7%**
- **Unemployment rates increased 9%**
- Financial institutions came under **considerable pressure**

#### Debt Paradox During Depression
- Even though deleveraging was needed, **debt as % GDP went up 40%** (12% annualized)
- Driven by: incomes declined + government borrowed more in response to crisis
- **Peak fiscal deficit: 10% of GDP** during the ugly period
- Attribution chart shows debt increase driven by falling incomes and fiscal response, not new borrowing

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge Methodology
- Gauges measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit
- Difference from zero conveys extent of bubble; crossing above/below zero = shifting in/out of bubble
- Composite gauges compiled from comprehensive stats in chart deck

### The Reflation Phase (1993-2000)

#### Policy Response: Aggressive and Comprehensive
- After relatively short bust, **policymakers provided enough stimulation** to create "beautiful" deleveraging
- **Sweden pulled 7 out of 9 classic policy levers** in managing crisis
- Monetary policy: **M0 increased 5% of GDP**, interest rates pushed to **3%**, real FX averaged **-5%**
- **Nationalized banks**, **provided liquidity**, **directly purchased troubled assets**
- **Structural reforms** to increase **labor market flexibility**

#### Recovery Dynamics
- Stimulation brought **nominal growth above nominal interest rates**
- Growth averaged **5%** during reflation; sovereign long rates fell to **4%**
- **Unemployment declined 1%**
- **Debt as % of GDP fell 28%** (4% annualized) — shown in attribution chart

#### Deleveraging Attribution (Reflation Period)
- Debt-to-income ratio reduction came **mostly from income rising**
- Driven primarily by **higher real growth**
- Took **3 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 4 years**

#### Gauge Interpretation
- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: bubble phase peaked ~3, depression bottomed ~-2, reflation returned to ~+1.5
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: peak tightening ~+1.0 during bubble, peak easing ~-1.5 during depression
- **Core inflation**: declined from ~9% during bubble to ~1% by 2000

### Market Behavior

#### Equity Markets
- **Massive equity rally** during reflation: equity price USD (indexed) rose from ~100 (1990) to ~800 (2000)
- Equities remained relatively flat during 1987-1993 bubble/bust, then exploded higher

#### Interest Rates and Yield Curve
- **Nominal long rate** and **nominal short rate** both declined from ~15% (late 1980s) to ~5% (2000)
- **Yield curve (SR-LR)**: fluctuated from +4% to -4%, normalizing near -2% by 2000
- **Real short rate**: spiked to ~17% during crisis (1992), normalized to ~4% by 2000

#### Currency and External Flows
- **Real FX vs TWI**: peaked at +30% (1990), crashed to -20% (1993), recovered to -10% (2000)
- **FX return for foreign investors** (indexed): volatile, ranging 80-140
- **Gold price (local FX, indexed)**: declined from ~140 (1987) to ~80 (2000)

### External Position

#### Capital Flows
- **Reserves data**: not available for this case
- **Capital inflows (%GDP)**: highly volatile, ranging 0-18%, spiked to ~18% by 2000
- **Capital outflows (%GDP)**: turned sharply negative, reaching **-22% by late 1990s** (major outflows)

#### Current Account
- **Current account (%GDP)**: swung from **-5% deficit (early 1990s)** to **+6% surplus (2000)**
- Major reversal reflecting improved competitiveness post-devaluation

#### Trade
- **Imports (%GDP)**: relatively stable around **30-35%** throughout period
- **Exports (%GDP)**: ranged **25-40%**, strengthened to ~40% by late 1990s

### Key Lessons from Sweden Case

- **Domestic currency debt** can still create severe crisis if debt service ratios reach extreme levels (65% of GDP)
- **Competitiveness matters**: real FX appreciation to +15% during bubble created vulnerability
- **Aggressive, comprehensive policy response** (7/9 levers) can transform ugly into beautiful deleveraging
- **Structural reforms** (labor market flexibility) complemented monetary/fiscal stimulus
- **Bank nationalization** and direct asset purchases were critical tools
- **Fiscal cost**: deficit reached 10% of GDP during crisis, but successful reflation restored fiscal health
- **Timeline**: 3 years to return to prior GDP peak, 4 years for equity recovery in USD terms

## Japan 1987–2017 Case Auto-Summary

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Deleveraging Cycle

Japan experienced a classic **deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1987 and 2017, consisting of three distinct phases: bubble, depression, and reflation.

### The Bubble Phase (1987-1989)

**Debt-Fueled Expansion**
- Driven by self-reinforcing cycle: rising debt → strong growth → strong asset returns
- Debts rose **24% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **307% of GDP**
- Debt characteristics: domestic currency, majority owned domestically, Japan was net creditor
- Capital repatriations helped maintain strong exchange rate despite shocks

**Economic Conditions**
- Investment inflows low: averaging ~**1% of GDP**
- Strong growth: **5%** annually
- GDP gap peaked at **4%**
- Equities averaged **28% annualized returns** over bubble period
- High economic activity levels sustained borrowing

**Policy Tightening**
- Policymakers initiated large tightening
- Short rates rising around **450 bps**
- Combined bubble pressures + tightening money/credit = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1989-2013)

**The Shock and Bust**
- Dynamic reversed → self-reinforcing bust and "ugly deleveraging"
- Pre-crisis peak: debt service reached **78% of GDP** → high vulnerability
- Shock arrived via **real estate and stock market busts**
- Stock prices fell **67%**
- Home prices fell **43%**
- Unemployment increased **3%**
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure

**Debt Paradox**
- Despite needing deleveraging, debt as % GDP rose **59%** (3% annualized)
- Driven primarily by **interest payments financed with new debt**
- Attribution chart shows debt increase despite deleveraging conditions

**Measurement Gauges**
- Bubble & Depression Gauge: tracks bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money/credit
- Distance from zero measures extent of bubble; crossing zero = shifting into/out of bubble
- Tightening & Easing Gauge: shows policy stance shifts
- Core Inflation tracked throughout cycle

### The Reflation Phase (2013-2017)

**Slow Initial Resolution**
- Resolution very slow initially
- Monetary policy struggled to push nominal GDP growth above nominal interest rates
- Eventually policymakers provided sufficient stimulation

**Aggressive Policy Response**
- Created "beautiful" deleveraging and reflation period beginning 2013
- **M0 increased 58% of GDP**
- Interest rates pushed to **0%**
- Real FX averaged **-10%** during stimulative phase

**Financial Sector Management**
- Very aggressive managing financial institutions and bad debts
- Pulled **7 out of 9 classic policy levers**:
  - Nationalized banks

### Template Characteristics

Japan's crisis exemplifies the **deflationary deleveraging** template where:
- Domestic currency debt dominates
- Net creditor status provides exchange rate stability
- Monetary policy effectiveness limited initially at zero bound
- Massive QE and direct asset purchases eventually succeed
- Structural reforms complement monetary/fiscal stimulus
- Long, slow recovery but ultimately successful reflation

- **Housing bust** triggered the crisis
- Pre-crisis **debt service reached 68% of GDP** → vulnerability to shock
- Self-reinforcing bust and "ugly deleveraging" 2007-2009

#### Economic Collapse
- **GDP fell 4%**
- **Stock prices fell 50%**
- **Home prices fell 28%**
- **Unemployment increased 5%**

#### Debt Paradox During Crisis
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt as % GDP increased 23% (15% annualized)**
- Driven primarily by **interest payments financed with new debt**
- Also driven by **falling real incomes**

#### Financial System Stress
- US financial institutions under considerable pressure
- Banking system required aggressive intervention

### The Reflation Phase (2009-2014)

#### Policy Response: "Beautiful Deleveraging"
- Policymakers provided **enough stimulation** to turn deleveraging into beautiful one
- Slightly shorter than average bust phase
- **US pulled 6 out of 9 classic policy levers**

#### Monetary Policy Tools
- **M0 increased 16% of GDP**
- **Interest rates pushed down to 0%**
- **Real FX averaged -10%** during stimulative phase

#### Direct Interventions
- **Recapitalized banks**
- **Provided liquidity**
- **Directly purchased troubled assets**
- Aggressive management of financial institutions and bad debts

#### Economic Recovery
- **Nominal growth well above nominal interest rates**
- Growth averaging **3%** during reflation period
- **Sovereign long rates fell to 2%**
- **Unemployment declined 3%**

#### Deleveraging Mechanics
- **Debt as % GDP fell 59% (11% annualized)** during reflation
- Reduction driven by mix of:
  - **Rising real incomes**
  - **Inflation**
  - **Paying down existing debt**
- Partially offset by interest payments financed with new debt

#### Recovery Timeline
- **4 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 5 years**

### Gauges and Indicators

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge
- Measures bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money/credit
- Distance from zero shows extent of bubble
- Crossing above/below zero represents shifting into/out of bubble
- Sharp transition from peak bubble (~1.0) to deep depression (~-2.5)
- Reflation phase shows gradual recovery back toward neutral

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge
- Shows peak tightening (~1.0) during late bubble phase
- Sharp reversal to peak easing (~-3.5) during crisis
- Gradual normalization during reflation, returning to tight territory by 2017

#### Core Inflation
- Relatively stable throughout cycle
- Peaked around **2.5-3.0% Y/Y** during bubble
- Declined to **~1.0%** during depression
- Recovered to **~2.0%** range during reflation

### Detailed Chart Data

#### Indebtedness Metrics
- **Total Debt peaked ~73% GDP** in 2007-2009

## Austria 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

- **Debt composition vulnerability**: Debt denominated in **Euros** (technically domestic currency but Austria lacked control); high foreign ownership created exposure to capital flight
- Debt rose **19% of GDP** during bubble, peaking at **279% of GDP** pre-crisis
- **Growth**: 3% annual during bubble period, aided by foreign capital inflows
- **Equity returns**: 20% annualized returns encouraged more borrowing and stimulated growth
- **Policy response**: Moderate tightening with short rates rising ~200 bps
- **Unsustainable dynamics**: Bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + tightening policy + weakened conditions in related countries = crisis setup

### The Depression Phase (2008-2009)

- **"Ugly deleveraging"**: Self-reinforcing bust from 2008-2009
- **Pre-crisis vulnerability**: Debt service reached **69% of GDP** before shock
- **Trigger**: 2008 global financial crisis
- **Economic collapse**: GDP fell **4%**, stock prices fell **66%**
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- **Debt paradox**: Despite needing deleveraging, debt/GDP rose **39% (32% annualized)** as incomes declined
- **Deleveraging attribution (Depression Period)**:
  - Change in domestic debt drove the 32% annualized increase
  - Real growth: negative contribution
  - Inflation: small positive contribution
  - Overall debt %GDP increase reflects income collapse overwhelming any debt reduction

### The Reflation Phase (2009-2017)

- **ECB intervention**: Provided enough stimulus to create "beautiful deleveraging" and reflation period beginning 2009
- **Monetary policy measures**:
  - M0 increased **19% of GDP**
  - Interest rates pushed to **0%**
  - Real FX averaged **-2%** during stimulative phase
- **Financial sector restructuring**: Austria aggressive in managing institutions and bad debts
  - Pulled **5 out of 9 classic policy levers**
  - Bank recapitalization and liquidity provision
- **Growth recovery**: Nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (growth averaged **3%** during period, sovereign long rates fell to **0%**)
- **Employment**: Unemployment rates remained flat during reflation
- **Debt reduction**: Debt/GDP fell **74% (9% annualized)**
- **Deleveraging attribution (Reflation Period)**:
  - **Inflation** drove most of debt-to-income ratio reduction (largest component)
  - Real growth: positive contribution
  - Change in domestic debt: modest positive contribution
  - Overall: **-9%** annualized debt/GDP reduction
- **Beautiful deleveraging mechanism**: Reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising (driven primarily by higher inflation), not just debt reduction
- **Incomplete recovery**: Took **3 years** before real GDP reached prior peak; equity prices in USD terms haven't fully recovered by 2017

### Chart Data Summary

**Indebtedness trends**:
- Total debt peaked ~70% GDP around 2007-2008
- Debt service peaked ~75% GDP around same time

- Exports: rose from ~45% to ~57% GDP during bubble, stabilized ~55% GDP post-crisis

## Germany 2006–2017 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase (pre-2008)

- **Atypical bubble**: Germany didn't experience broad-based domestic bubble, but was "tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets that were experiencing bubble-like conditions"
- **Debt accumulation**: Built substantial debt stock reaching **261% of GDP** prior to crisis
- **Currency constraint**: Debt in **Euros** (technically domestic but Germany lacked control)
- **Debt ownership**: Most debt owned **domestically** (unlike Austria's foreign-owned debt)

### The Depression Phase (2008-2009)

- Cycle turned to "self-reinforcing bust and ugly deleveraging" from 2008-2009
- **Pre-crisis vulnerability**: Debt service reached **51% of GDP**
- **Trigger**: 2008 global financial crisis
- **Economic impact**: GDP fell **7%**, stock prices fell **53%**
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- **Debt paradox**: Despite needing deleveraging, debt/GDP rose **26% (18% annualized)** as incomes declined
- **Deleveraging attribution (Depression Period)**:
  - Change in domestic debt: primary driver of 18% annualized increase
  - Real growth: negative contribution (income collapse)
  - Inflation: minor contribution

### The Reflation Phase (2009-2017)

- **ECB intervention**: "Slightly shorter than average bust phase" followed by sufficient stimulus to create "beautiful deleveraging" and reflation beginning 2009
- **Monetary policy**:
  - M0 increased **14% of GDP**
  - Interest rates

- **Debt reduction**: Total debt fell 56% (7% annualized) from peak
- **Short rates**: Pushed to -1%
- **Real FX depreciation**: -4% average during stimulative phase
- **Nominal growth vs. rates**: Growth averaged 3%, sovereign long rates fell to 0%
- **Unemployment**: Declined by 4 percentage points
- **"Beautiful" deleveraging**: Debt-to-income reduction came primarily from income rising, driven by real growth
- **Recovery timeline**: Took 3 years for real GDP to reach prior peak
- **Equity markets**: Haven't fully recovered in USD terms

#### Policy Response Effectiveness
- **Policy lever deployment**: 6 of 9 classic levers used
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity support
  - Directly purchased troubled assets
- **Stimulation quality**: Successfully brought nominal growth well above nominal interest rates
- **Attribution**: Real growth contributed most to deleveraging, with inflation and debt change playing smaller roles

## Greece 2005-2018 Case Study

### Overview
- **Crisis type**: Classic deflationary deleveraging cycle starting 2005
- **Currency constraint**: Euro-denominated debt (technically domestic but without sovereign control)
- **Foreign ownership**: High share of debt owned by foreigners, creating pullback vulnerability

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

#### Debt Dynamics
- **Debt accumulation**: Rose 40% of GDP during bubble
- **Pre-crisis peak**: 206% of GDP
- **Currency risk**: Debt in Euros, which Greece didn't control

#### Capital Flows and External Position
- **Investment inflows**: Strong, averaging 22% of GDP
- **Current account deficit**: 13% of GDP
- **Foreign financing dependence**: Critical vulnerability

#### Growth and Asset Returns
- **Real growth**: Strong at 3%
- **GDP gap**: Peaked at 10% (high economic activity levels)
- **Equity returns**: 19% annualized over bubble period
- **Asset-debt spiral**: Strong returns encouraged more borrowing, stimulating further growth

#### Policy Stance
- **Monetary tightening**: Moderate (short rates rose ~200 bps)
- **Unsustainability**: Bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + tightening money/credit + weakened conditions in related countries = untenable situation

### The Depression Phase (2008-2017)

#### The Trigger
- **Shock event**: 2008 global financial crisis
- **Pre-crisis vulnerability**: Debt service at 42% of GDP
- **Dynamic reversal**: Self-reinforcing bust and "ugly deleveraging"

#### Capital and Credit Collapse
- **Foreign funding withdrawal**: Capital inflows fell 34% of GDP
- **Credit tightening**: Short rates increased 86%
- **Self-reinforcing decline**: Tightening → GDP collapse → asset price collapse → unemployment spike

#### Economic Contraction
- **GDP decline**: -27%
- **Stock market crash**: -91%
- **Home prices**: -42%
- **Unemployment**: +15 percentage points
- **Financial institutions**: Under considerable pressure

#### Debt Dynamics (Paradox of Deleveraging)
- **Debt-to-GDP rise**: +101% (11% annualized) despite needing deleveraging
- **Primary driver**: Falling real incomes
- **Secondary factor**: Interest payments financed with new debt
- **Attribution breakdown**:
  - Real growth (negative) pushed debt/GDP sharply higher
  - Interest payments added burden
  - Defaults, new debt, and monetization provided partial offsets

#### Gauge Analysis
- **Bubble/Depression gauge**: Peaked around +1.5 in bubble, plunged to -2.0 in depression
- **Tightening/Easing gauge**: Peaked at +2.0 (peak tightening ~2010), then fell to -3.0+ (peak easing)
- **Core inflation**: Fell from 3-4% to -3%, then recovered toward 0-1%

### The Reflation Phase (2017-)

#### Limited Success
- **Nominal growth**: Never pushed above nominal interest rates by adequate monetary easing
- **"Beautiful" phase absent**: Incomplete transition to healthy deleveraging

#### Political Consequences
- **Populist emergence**: Crisis set stage for **Alexis Tsipras** to take power
- **Political shift**: Many considered Tsipras a populist leader

#### Deleveraging Attribution (2017-)
- **Debt change**: -19% annualized
- **Components**:
  - Net new debt (gray): Largest negative contributor
  - Defaults (yellow): Significant negative contribution
  - Real growth (blue): Small positive contribution
  - Interest (red): Moderate positive contribution
  - Inflation: Small contribution
  - Monetization: Minimal

## Hungary 2005–2017 Deflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Cycle

- **Hungary** experienced a textbook deflationary deleveraging between 2005-2017
- Three distinct phases: bubble (2005-2008), depression/ugly deleveraging (2008-2013), reflation/beautiful deleveraging (2013-2017)
- Case demonstrates how **foreign currency debt** and **reliance on foreign capital** amplify crisis vulnerability

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

#### Debt-Fueled Growth Dynamics

- **Total debt** rose 45% of GDP during bubble, peaking at **214% of GDP**
- Debt denominated in **domestic currency** (Hungarian forint), but high share owned by foreigners
- This foreign ownership created exposure to **capital flight risk**
- Real **growth** averaged **3%** during bubble; **GDP gap** peaked at 5%

#### Capital Flows and Current Account

- **Investment inflows** moderately strong, averaging **6% of GDP**
- Financed **current account deficit of 8% of GDP**
- Rising debt and capital enabled strong economic activity above potential

#### Asset Price Inflation

- **Equities** delivered **14% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing in self-reinforcing loop
- Bubble pressures combined with foreign financing dependence created unsustainable situation
- Weakened conditions in related countries added systemic fragility

#### Debt Service Burden

- Pre-crisis **debt service** reached **31% of GDP**
- Made Hungary highly vulnerable to external shocks

### The Depression Phase (2008-2013): "Ugly Deleveraging"

#### Crisis Triggers and Capital Flight

- **2008 global financial crisis** triggered the reversal
- **Portfolio inflows** collapsed, falling **12% of GDP**
- Foreign funding withdrawal forced severe economic contraction

#### Policy Response: Tightening

- Policymakers **hiked short rates by 5%** in response to capital flight
- Tightening amplified the self-reinforcing downturn
- Classic mistake: prioritizing currency defense over growth support

#### Economic Collapse

- **Real GDP** fell **7%** from peak
- **Stock prices** crashed **73%**
- **Home prices** fell **16%**
- **Unemployment** rose **3 percentage points**
- **Core inflation** plunged from ~4% to below zero, reaching **-3%**

#### Debt Dynamics Worsen Despite Deleveraging Need

- Paradoxically, **debt-to-GDP rose 37%** (7% annualized) during depression
- Income collapsed faster than debt could be paid down
- Government forced to **borrow more** to respond to crisis
- **Peak fiscal deficit**: 5% of GDP during ugly period
- Attribution chart shows negative real growth and inflation both increased debt burden
- Demonstrates why "austerity during depression" fails: incomes fall faster than debt

#### Financial System Stress

- Hungarian financial institutions came under "considerable pressure"
- Required aggressive intervention and bad debt management

### The Reflation Phase (2013-2017): "Beautiful Deleveraging"

#### Policy Stimulus Succeeds

- Policymakers provided sufficient stimulus to reverse the dynamic
- **M0 money supply** increased **4% of GDP**
- **Interest rates** pushed down to **0%**
- **Real FX** averaged **-6%** depreciation during stimulative phase (competitive devaluation)
- **IMF assistance program** provided external support and credibility

#### Aggressive Financial Sector Restructuring

- Hungary pulled **4 out of 9 classic policy levers** for managing bad debts
- Systematic approach to cleaning up financial institutions
- Created foundation for sustainable recovery

#### Growth Recovery

- **Nominal growth** well above **nominal interest rates** — critical for debt sustainability
- Real growth averaged **5%** during reflation period
- **Sovereign long rates** fell to **2%** as confidence returned
- **Unemployment** declined **7 percentage points**

#### Debt Reduction Through Growth

- **Debt-to-GDP** fell **51%** (12% annualized) during beautiful deleveraging
- Attribution chart shows reduction came "mostly from income rising"
- Driven primarily by **higher real growth** — not austerity
- Took **6 years** for real GDP to reach prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD** still haven't fully recovered by 2017

#### Political Consequences

- Crisis created conditions for **Viktor Orban** to take power
- Many consider Orban a **populist leader**
- Demonstrates how debt crises reshape political landscape
- Economic pain creates appetite for political change and strong leadership

### Key Metrics and Gauges

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge

- Composite measure of bubble/depression conditions
- Peaked around 1.5-2.0 during bubble phase
- Plunged to -2.0 during depression
- Gradually recovered toward zero during reflation
- Zero crossing represents shift from depression back to normal

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge

- Composite measure of monetary conditions
- **Peak tightening** occurred ~2008 during crisis response
- **Peak easing** occurred ~2013-2015 during reflation
- Shows how policy stance shifted 180 degrees between phases

#### Deleveraging Attribution Analysis

**Depression Period (2008-2013):**
- Real growth: large negative contribution (pink bar)
- Inflation: negative contribution (deflation increased real debt burden)
- Change in domestic debt: positive (green — had to borrow more)
- FX debt changes: significant contribution from currency moves
- Net result: **+7% annualized increase** in debt-to-GDP despite depression

**Reflation Period (2013-2017):**
- Real growth: large negative contribution to debt ratio (blue — growth reduces debt/GDP)
- Inflation: moderate contribution
- Change in domestic debt: small positive
- FX debt changes: large contribution from depreciation strategy
- Net result: **-12% annualized decrease** in debt-to-GDP

### Supporting Chart Data

#### Monetary Policy Evolution

- **Nominal short rate**: ~8-14% during bubble, spiked to ~12% during crisis, fell to near-zero by 2017
- **Money0 level**: steady rise from ~8% of GDP (2002) to ~16% of GDP (2017), accelerating during reflation

#### Fiscal Balance

- Improved from -8% to -10% of GDP (2002-2008) to near-zero by 2017
- U-shaped recovery during reflation phase

#### Economic Conditions

- **Real GDP (indexed)**: climbed to ~102 (2008), crashed to ~75 (2013), recovered to ~77 (2017)
- **Real growth Y/Y**: volatile, ranging from +7% to -10%, stabilized around 0-2% by 2017
- **GDP gap**: peaked at ~10% (2008), fell to -10% (2013), recovered to near-zero by 2017
- **Nominal long rate** vs **nominal growth**: long rates peaked at ~35% during crisis, fell to ~5-10% during reflation

#### Market Performance

- **Equity prices (USD, indexed)**: climbed from ~30 to ~120 during bubble, crashed to ~15, recovered to ~20 by 2017
- **Yield curve (SR-LR)**: spiked to +60% during crisis peak, normalized to near-zero
- **Real FX vs TWI**: volatile, ranging from -4% to +8%

#### External Position

- **Reserves (USD, indexed)**: collapsed from ~1,400 to ~100 during crisis, gradually recovered to ~400-500
- **Capital inflows**: peaked at ~35% of GDP (2008), crashed to near-zero, recovered to moderate levels
- **Imports**: rose from ~25% to ~50% of GDP during bubble, fell back to ~30%
- **Current account**: improved from -25% deficit to near-balance by 2017
- **Capital outflows**: volatile, ranging from -20% to +15% of GDP
- **Exports**: rose from ~15% to ~35% of GDP over full period

#### Real Interest Rates

- **Real short rate**: spiked to nearly +100% during crisis peak (nominal rates high, deflation made real rates extreme)
- Normalized to near-zero during reflation

### Lessons from Hungary Case

- **Foreign currency debt** and **foreign ownership** create acute vulnerability to capital flight
- **Tightening during crisis** amplifies damage — rate hikes to defend currency backfire
- **Debt-to-GDP rises during depression** even when deleveraging needed — incomes fall faster than debt
- **"Beautiful deleveraging" requires growth** — can't cut way to prosperity
- **Nominal growth > nominal rates** is the key sustainability condition
- **Aggressive policy response works** — monetary easing, currency depreciation, bad debt cleanup
- **Political consequences are severe** — crises empower populist leaders
- **Recovery is slow** — 6 years to prior GDP peak, equity markets still impaired

## Ireland 2005–2017: Deflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Cycle

**Ireland** experienced a **classic deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 2005 and 2017, progressing through three distinct phases: bubble, depression, and reflation.

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

#### Debt Dynamics
- Debts rose **94% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **271% of GDP**
- Debt denominated in **Euros** — technically Ireland's domestic currency but **not under Irish control**
- High share of debt **owned by foreigners** → exposure to capital flight risk

#### Growth and Capital Flows
- **Investment inflows** averaged ~**95% of GDP** → financed **5% of GDP current account deficit**
- Strong growth at **5%** annually
- **GDP gap peaked at 8%** (high economic activity levels)
- **Moderate asset returns**: equities averaged **5% annualized returns** during bubble period

#### Policy and Competitiveness Issues
- **Moderate tightening**: short rates rose ~**220 bps**
- **Competitiveness became an issue**: Ireland's **real FX peaked at +17%**
- Bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + tightening money/credit + weakened conditions in related countries = **unsustainable situation**

### The Depression Phase (2008-2013)

#### The Deleveraging Mechanism
- Self-reinforcing bust and **"ugly deleveraging"** (2008-2013)
- Pre-crisis: **debt service reached 77% of GDP** → made Ireland vulnerable to shock
- Shock came via **European debt crisis**

#### Economic Collapse
- **GDP fell 9%**
- **Stock prices fell 73%**
- **Home prices fell 53%**
- **Unemployment rates increased 9%**
- **Financial institutions under considerable pressure**

#### Debt Paradox During Depression
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt as % GDP went up by 35%** (7% annualized)
- Driven primarily by:
  - **Interest payments financed with new debt**
  - **Deflation** (to lesser extent)
- Partially offset by **defaults**

#### Gauges and Indicators
- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: moved from bubble peak (~1.0) to deep depression (below -1.5)
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: shifted from peak tightening (~1.5) to peak easing (below -1.5)
- **Core inflation**: fell from ~3% to below -2% (deflationary period)

### The Reflation Phase (2013-2017)

#### ECB Policy Response
- After relatively long bust phase, **ECB policymakers provided enough stimulation** to turn deleveraging into **"beautiful one"**
- Period of **reflation began in 2013**

#### Monetary Policy Tools
- **M0 increased by 14% of GDP**

### Key Lessons from Ireland Case

1. **Euro constraint**: Ireland lacked monetary sovereignty despite Euro being "domestic" currency
2. **Foreign debt vulnerability**: High foreign ownership of debt amplified capital flight risk
3. **Policy response matters**: ECB's eventual aggressive stimulus (7 of 9 levers) enabled "beautiful deleveraging"
4. **Structural reforms critical**: Labor market flexibility reforms supported recovery
5. **Long recovery timeline**: 6 years to restore real GDP to prior peak; equity markets still hadn't fully recovered after 9+ years
6. **Competitiveness trap**: Real FX appreciation during bubble (+17%) created unsustainable position
7. **Debt paradox**: Even during deleveraging phase, debt/GDP rose due to interest payments and deflation — required sustained reflation to reverse

## Italy 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary

### Overview: Classic Deflationary Deleveraging Cycle

Italy experienced a **classic deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 2005 and 2017, divided into three distinct phases: bubble, depression, and reflation.

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

#### Debt Dynamics
- **Self-reinforcing cycle** of rising debt and strong growth
- Debts rose **29% of GDP** during bubble period to pre-crisis peak of **270% of GDP**
- Debt denominated in **Euros** (technically Italy's domestic currency but not under Italy's control)
- High share of debt **owned by foreigners** → exposure to foreign capital pullback risk

#### Growth and Financing
- Investment inflows moderately strong: averaging **~7% of GDP**
- Financed current account deficit of **1% of GDP**
- Moderate growth at **2%**
- High levels of economic activity (**GDP gap peaked at 4%**)

#### Market Performance
- Strong asset returns: equities averaged **7% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Encouraged more borrowing and stimulated growth

#### Policy Response
- Moderate tightening: short rates rising around **200 bps**

#### Unsustainability
> These bubble pressures and Italy's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### The Depression Phase (2008-2015)

#### The Turn
- Dynamic produced **self-reinforcing bust** and "ugly deleveraging"
- At pre-crisis peak, debt service reached **58% of GDP** → made Italy vulnerable to shock
- Shock came via **European debt crisis**

#### Capital Flight and Decline
- Fall in foreign funding: portfolio inflows falling by **14% of GDP**
- Self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by **9%**)
- Stock prices falling by **67%**
- Home prices falling by **15%**
- Unemployment rates increased by **6%**

#### Debt Paradox
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt as % GDP went up by 48%** (7% annualized)
- Driven primarily by **interest payments financed with new debt**
- Lesser extent by falling real incomes

#### Financial Sector Pressure
- Italy's financial institutions came under considerable pressure

### The Reflation Phase (2015-2017)

#### ECB Policy Intervention
- **M0 increased by 16% of GDP**
- Interest rates ultimately pushed down to **0%**
- Real FX averaged **-1%** during stimulative phase

#### Domestic Reforms
- Italy aggressive in managing financial institutions and bad debts
- Pulled **4 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- Enacted **structural reforms** to increase labor market flexibility

#### Results
- Stimulation brought **nominal growth above nominal interest rates**
- Growth averaging **1.8%** during this period
- Sovereign long rates falling to **1.2%**
- Unemployment rates declined by **1%**
- Debt as % of GDP fell by **36%** (14% annualized)

#### Deleveraging Attribution (Reflation Period)
- Reduction in debt-to-income ratios driven by:
  - Mix of **monetization**
  - Paying down existing debt
  - Lesser role of real growth and inflation

#### Incomplete Recovery
- Real GDP has **not yet reached** its prior peak
- Equity prices in USD terms **haven't yet fully recovered**

#### Political Impact
> The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Italy, as it helped set the stage for Giuseppe Conte, whom many people consider a populist leader, to take power in 2018.

## Netherlands 2006-2017 Case Study

### Case Overview: Classic Deflationary Deleveraging

- **Netherlands experienced classic deflationary deleveraging cycle** between 2006-2017
- Three distinct phases: bubble (2006-2008), depression (2008-2014), reflation (2014-2017)
- Debt denominated in **euros** — technically domestic currency but not under Netherlands' control
- **High foreign ownership** of debt created exposure to capital flight risk
- Charts show external position dynamics: reserves indexed in USD, capital inflows, imports/exports, current account

### The Bubble Phase (2006-2008)

#### Debt Dynamics
- **Debts rose 10% of GDP** during bubble period
- Pre-crisis peak: **355% of GDP** total debt
- **68% debt service to GDP** at peak — extremely vulnerable to shocks
- Foreign ownership created dependency on external financing
- Strong capital inflows averaging **~14% of GDP**

#### Growth and Asset Returns
- **Growth strong at 3%** during bubble phase
- GDP gap peaked at **5%** (high economic activity levels)
- **Equities averaged 11% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing, creating self-reinforcing cycle
- High debt + rising capital enabled strong growth momentum

#### Monetary Conditions
- Policymakers initiated **moderate tightening**
- Short rates rose around **200 bps**
- Despite tightening, bubble conditions persisted
- Investment inflows remained strong despite policy attempts to cool economy

#### Vulnerability Factors
- Bubble pressures combined with **dependence on foreign financing**
- **Tightening money and credit** alongside weakened conditions in related countries
- Created fundamentally **unsustainable situation**
- Euro denomination meant no independent monetary control

### The Depression Phase (2008-2014)

#### The Shock and Reversal
- **2008 global financial crisis** triggered self-reinforcing bust
- Term used: **"ugly deleveraging"** ran from 2008-2014
- Dynamic turned from virtuous to vicious cycle

#### Economic Collapse
- **GDP fell 4%** during depression
- **Stock prices fell 57%**
- **Home prices fell 20%**
- **Unemployment increased 4%**
- Financial institutions came under considerable pressure

#### Paradoxical Debt Dynamics
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt as % GDP rose 74%** (12% annualized)
- **Debt-to-GDP ratio increased** even though deleveraging was necessary
- Income declines outpaced debt reduction
- Attribution chart shows real growth negative, inflation negative, change in domestic debt positive

#### Gauge Measurements
- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: peaked at ~1.0 during bubble, fell to -1.5+ during depression trough
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: sharp drop from moderate tightening (~0.5) to deep easing (-2.0+), then peak tightening (~1.5), then peak easing (-2.5)
- **Core inflation**: declined from ~2% to under 1%, showing deflationary pressures
- Gauges measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit

### The Reflation Phase (2014-2017)

#### ECB Policy Response
- After "relatively long bust phase," **ECB provided enough stimulation**
- Turned deleveraging into **"beautiful deleveraging"**
- Period of **reflation began in 2014**

#### Monetary Stimulus
- **M0 increased 16% of GDP**
- **Interest rates pushed down to -1%**
- **Real FX averaged -2%** during stimulative phase
- Sovereign long rates fell to **0%**

#### Policy Levers Deployed
- Netherlands aggressive in managing financial institutions and bad debts
- Pulled **5 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- Specifically: **nationalized banks and provided liquidity**
- This stimulation brought nominal growth well above nominal interest rates

#### Growth Recovery
- **Nominal growth averaging 3%** during reflation period
- Growth well above nominal interest rates (sovereign long rates at 0%)
- **Unemployment declined 3%**
- Real GDP indexed recovered from ~100 to ~110

#### Deleveraging Success
- **Debt as % GDP fell 46%** (12% annualized)
- Attribution chart shows: mostly real growth (blue), some inflation (pink), negative change in domestic debt (green)
- Debt reduction came **mostly from income rising**, driven primarily by higher real growth
- Throughout "beautiful" period, debt-to-income ratios declined significantly

#### Incomplete Recovery
- Took **7 years before real GDP reached prior peak**
- **Equity prices in USD terms haven't fully recovered** by end of study period (2017)
- Despite successful deleveraging, full asset price recovery remained elusive

- **Exports**: rose from ~20% GDP to ~40% GDP (2002-2008), stable ~30-35% post-crisis (first page shows 20-45%)
- Second set shows **Exports 40-100% GDP** — much higher scale, suggesting different measurement or data source

### Key Takeaways

- **Euro constraint**: lack of monetary sovereignty amplified crisis and limited policy options
- **Foreign dependence**: reliance on external capital created vulnerability when flows reversed
- **Paradox of deleveraging**: debt ratios can worsen during depression even as absolute debt falls
- **Beautiful vs ugly**: adequate monetary stimulus (ECB) transformed ugly into beautiful deleveraging
- **Income matters most**: successful debt reduction came primarily through real growth, not nominal debt paydown
- **Slow recovery**: even successful deleveraging took 7 years to restore real GDP, asset prices lagged further
- **Policy coordination**: national policy levers (bank nationalization, liquidity) combined with supranational monetary policy (ECB) to achieve reflation

> Spain's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### The Depression Phase (2008-2013)

#### The "Ugly Deleveraging"
- **Debt service reached 64% of GDP** at pre-crisis peak → made Spain vulnerable to shock
- Shock came via **European debt crisis**
- **Foreign funding collapsed**: capital inflows fell **16% of GDP**
- **Self-reinforcing declines**:
  - GDP fell **9%**
  - Stock prices fell **60%**
  - Home prices fell **31%**
  - **Unemployment rose 17%**
- **Financial institutions under considerable pressure**

#### Debt Dynamics During Depression
- **Debt/GDP rose 86% (17% annualized)**
- Driven primarily by:
  - Interest payments financed with new debt
  - To lesser extent: falling real incomes
- Government fiscal deterioration less prominent than Portugal

## Germany 1918–1925: Wartime Hyperinflationary Deleveraging

### Overview: A Classic War-Driven Crisis

- Germany experienced a **wartime hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle** 1918-1925
- Unlike typical bubble-driven crises, roots lay in **WWI financing** through massive borrowing
- War economy disruption: shifted production to military, workforce to armed services
- **Debt rose to 158% of GDP** during war; 64% was foreign currency debt
- Growth severely hampered during war (-6% average)
- Losers of major wars face **far worse postwar depressions** than winners

### The War Phase (1914-1918)

#### Financing and Economic Structure
- Germany **borrowed heavily** to finance large fiscal deficits
- Economic statistics distorted by war production shifts
- Normal economic linkages broke down during wartime mobilization
- **Foreign currency exposure** created severe vulnerability (64% of GDP in FX debt)

### The Postwar Depression Phase (1918-1923)

#### Balance of Payments Crisis
- Postwar crisis ran 1918-1923 as both **depression and BOP crisis**
- Heavy foreign currency debt burden amplified crisis severity
- Self-reinforcing GDP decline of **-5%**
- Stock prices collapsed **-97%**
- Unemployment jumped **+16 percentage points**
- Financial institutions under severe pressure

#### The Debt Trap
- Even as Germany needed deleveraging, **debt/GDP rose +165%** (31% annualized)
- Mechanism: incomes falling while government absorbed **war-related costs**
- Peak fiscal deficit: **11% of GDP** during worst period
- Attribution analysis shows inflation couldn't offset the debt accumulation from falling incomes and fiscal costs

### The Reflation Phase (1923-1925)

#### Policy Response Dynamics
- **Key policy choice**: Allow financial tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money (inflationary)
- Germany's initial tightening **insufficient** to produce needed adjustments
- Result: spiral of **declining exchange rates and hyperinflation**
- Inflation peaked at **over 10,000%**

#### Risk Factors for Hyperinflation
- Germany had most classic **"risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals**
- Biggest risk: **fiscal deficit** (peak 11% of GDP)
- Germany aggressive on **5 of 9 typical policy levers**:
  - Managing financial institutions
  - Handling bad debts

#### Breaking the Spiral
- Stopping hyperinflation required **significant structural changes**:
  - Abandoned hyperinflated **papiermark**
  - Adopted new **reichsmark** currency in 1924
- **15 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Deleveraging attribution (reflation period): **-98% debt reduction** primarily through inflation
- Virtually complete debt wipeout via currency collapse

### Gauges and Metrics

- Money had negative real return—incentive to spend immediately

### Market Conditions

#### Equity Prices (USD-Indexed)
- Pre-war buildup from ~50 to ~120 (index)
- Catastrophic collapse to near zero
- Partial recovery to ~80-100 range by late 1920s
- Never fully recovered pre-war peak in USD terms

#### Interest Rate Environment
- Nominal long rate: **~5%** pre-war, declining to **~1-2%** by late 1920s
- Nominal short rate: similar pattern, falling to near zero
- Yield curve mostly positive throughout

#### FX and Real Assets
- **Real FX vs. TWI** (trade-weighted index): collapsed from +10% to **-20%** (currency depreciation)
- Partial recovery to neutral by late 1920s
- **Gold price (local FX, indexed)**: explosion from ~50 to **~250** peak (5x increase)
- Gold as inflation hedge worked dramatically
- **FX return for foreign investors**: climbed pre-war to ~110, collapsed to ~60 (near-half loss)

### External Position

#### Reserves
- Relatively stable ~100-120 (indexed) pre-war
- Brief dip during crisis to ~90
- Dramatic recovery to **~350** (indexed) by late 1920s
- Tripling of reserves as economy stabilized and capital returned

- Recovery to ~27-30% by late 1920s

- **Current account**: small deficit **-1% to -3%** of GDP pre-war
- Widened to **-6% to -7%** during crisis
- Improvement to **-3% to -4%** by late 1920s (still deficit)

- **Capital outflows**: highly volatile
- Pre-war: **-20% to -60%** of GDP (capital flight)
- Crisis spike: **+60%** of GDP (repatriation/forced sales)
- Return to modest outflows by late 1920s

- **Exports**: steady ~25-33% of GDP
- Brief wartime dip
- Recovery to ~27-30% of GDP by late 1920s

### Key Lessons

- **War debts + foreign currency exposure = severe vulnerability** to postwar crisis
- **Insufficient tightening** can lead to worse outcomes (hyperinflation) than bold tightening
- **Fiscal deficits** are primary risk factor for hyperinflation spirals
- **Currency reform** ultimately necessary when hyperinflation becomes entrenched
- **Recovery timelines are long**: 15 years to regain real GDP peak
- **Hard assets (gold) protect** against currency collapse
- **Foreign investors suffer** massive losses in hyperinflationary episodes
- Once hyperinflation dynamic starts, **real interest rates go deeply negative**, accelerating the spiral

## Argentina 1977–1988 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase (1977-1980)

- **Classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1977-1988
- Bubble driven by self-reinforcing cycle: rising debt + strong equity returns + strong growth
- By bubble's end: debt reached **39% of GDP** (peak), with **15% of GDP in foreign currencies**
- Large FX exposure created vulnerability to capital pullback
- Capital inflows modest but positive: averaging **~2% of GDP**
- Growth moderate at **2%**, but high economic activity (GDP gap peaked at **8%**)
- Equities averaged **52% annualized returns** during bubble — encouraged more borrowing, stimulated growth
- Competitiveness problem: real FX peaked at **+70%**
- Bubble pressures + dependence on foreign financing + weakened conditions in related countries = unsustainable

### The Depression Phase (1980-1985)

- Self-reinforcing bust triggered by **1980s Latin American Debt Crisis**
- Capital inflows fell **9% of GDP** — major shock
- Policymakers hiked short rates **>250%** (tightening)
- Real FX fell **93%** (currency collapse)
- GDP fell **14%**, stock prices fell **91%**
- Unemployment rose **3%**
- Currency weakness drove very high and rising inflation
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- Central bank spent down reserves to defend currency (reserves fell **83%**), eventually abandoned defense
- **Debt paradox**: despite needing deleveraging, debt/GDP rose **33%** (7% annualized) because:
  - Currency collapse increased burden of foreign-denominated debts
  - Government had to borrow more in response to crisis (peak fiscal deficit **5% of GDP**)

### The Reflation Phase (1985-1988)

- Key policy choice: allow tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money (inflationary)
- Argentina's tightening wasn't enough — fell into spiral of declining exchange rates and hyperinflation
- Real FX bottomed at **-138%**, inflation peaked **>1,000%**
- Argentina had ~half the classic **"risk factors"** for bigger inflation spirals (biggest: low real short rates)
- Somewhat aggressive financial management: **3 out of 9 typical policy levers**
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity
  - Benefited from **IMF assistance program**
- Stopping inflation ultimately required **structural changes**:
  - Abandoned hyperinflated **peso ley**
  - Adopted **peso argentino** in 1983
- Took **7 years** before real GDP reached prior peak

### Deleveraging Dynamics

**Depression period attribution** (1980-1985):
- Debt/GDP rose **7%** annualized despite deleveraging need

## Brazil 1977-1987 Inflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview: Classic Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- Brazil experienced **inflationary deleveraging** between 1977-1987, distinct from typical broad-based bubble cases
- Linked to other countries experiencing bubble-like conditions, building substantial debt through capital inflows
- **Pre-crisis debt: 158% of GDP**, with **70% foreign-currency denominated**—creating massive FX exposure
- Current account deficit: **5% of GDP**; capital inflows: **6% of GDP** average pre-crisis
- Crisis triggered by weakness in related economies, creating unsustainable dependency on foreign financing

### The Bubble Phase: Foreign Capital Dependency

- No broad domestic bubble, but **unsustainably strong capital inflows** driving debt accumulation
- High foreign-currency debt share (70% of GDP) left Brazil vulnerable to capital reversal
- Became dependent on continuous foreign financing to sustain current account deficit
- Combination of high debts + foreign financing dependency + weakened conditions in related countries = unsustainable

### The Depression Phase (1980-1983)

#### Crisis Trigger and Initial Impact

- **1980s Latin American Debt Crisis** triggered self-reinforcing bust and balance of payments/currency crisis
- **Capital inflows fell 5% of GDP**, forcing severe adjustment
- Policymakers responded with massive tightening: **short rates hiked 234%**
- **Currency (real FX) fell 20%**, amplifying crisis dynamics
- **GDP declined 6%**; **stock prices fell 51%**

#### Extreme Inflation Dynamics

- **Inflation peaked at 124%** during depression—high compared to similar cases
- Brazil had classic "risk factors" for **inflation spirals**, especially **low real short rates**
- Currency weakness contributed to rising inflation momentum
- Financial institutions came under severe pressure

#### Central Bank Response and Debt Dynamics

- Central bank **spent down 70% of reserves** defending the currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**, allowing further depreciation
- Despite deleveraging need, **debt-to-GDP rose 54% (18% annualized)** during depression
- Two drivers of debt increase:
  1. **Currency depreciation** increased burden of foreign-denominated debts
  2. **Government borrowing** to respond to crisis (peak fiscal deficit: **11% of GDP**)

### The Reflation Phase (1983-1987)

#### Policy Choice: Inflation Over Deflation

- Key policy decision: whether to defend currency (painful but typically necessary) or **print money** (inflationary)
- Brazil **abandoned currency peg** after longer-than-average "ugly" phase
- Allowed sufficient **tightening** to reduce import spending and improve current account (**+3% of GDP improvement**)
- Made currency more attractive to hold, eventually stabilizing flows

#### Aggressive Financial Management

- Pulled **4 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- **Nationalized banks** and provided liquidity support
- Managed financial institutions aggressively, removing bad debts
- Received **IMF assistance program**

#### Deleveraging Through Nominal Growth

- **Debt-to-GDP fell 121% (27% annualized)** over reflation period
- Reduction came primarily from **nominal income rising**, not real deleveraging
- **Real FX bottomed at -33%** during "beautiful period," setting up renewed competitiveness

#### Recovery Timeline and Outcomes

- **4 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 1.9 years**
- Lower currency positioned Brazil for export competitiveness
- Sustained high inflation (reaching **350%+ by 1990**) as cost of avoiding deflationary collapse

### Gauges and Attribution Analysis

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge

- Composite measure showing Brazil's movement through cycle phases
- Clear transition: Bubble → Depression (bottoming ~1983) → Reflation → new bubble formation
- Depression gauge reached approximately -1.8 before turning

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge

- **Peak tightening** around 1982-1983 coinciding with depression bottom
- Massive swing from tightening to **peak easing** during reflation
- Easing remained elevated through late 1980s, supporting nominal growth strategy

#### Core Inflation Trajectory

- Steady acceleration from ~50% (1975-1980) to **100%+** by 1982
- Dramatic spike to **300%+** by late 1980s
- Brief dip during depression (1983-1984) before resuming explosive growth
- Hyperinflationary dynamics by 1990

#### Deleveraging Attribution

**Depression Period (1980-1983):**
- **Real Growth**: Large negative contribution (red)
- **Inflation**: Positive contribution to nominal debt reduction
- **Domestic Debt Change**: Positive (green)
- **FX Debt Change due to FX Move**: Large positive contribution (orange)—currency depreciation increased FX debt burden
- **Net: +18% annualized** debt-to-GDP increase despite depression

**Reflation Period (1983-1987):**
- **Real Growth**: Modest positive contribution (blue)
- **Inflation**: Largest positive contribution (pink)—dominant deleveraging mechanism
- **Domestic Debt Change**: Significant positive contribution (green)
- **FX Debt Change**: Continued positive contribution
- **Net: -27% annualized** debt-to-GDP reduction

### Market Dynamics

#### Equity Markets

- **Depression**: 51% decline in USD terms
- Extreme volatility during 1980s crisis period
- Strong recovery during reflation, peaking ~450 (indexed) by late 1980s
- Pattern: crash → bottom (~100) → rally → peak → second decline

#### Interest Rates

- **Nominal short rates**: From ~50% (early 1980s) to **4000%** peaks (mid-1980s)
- **Nominal long rates**: Similar explosive pattern, though less volatile
- Real short rates: Highly volatile, swinging from **-50% to +200%**
- Rate volatility reflected ongoing inflation spiral and policy uncertainty

### External Position

#### Reserves and Capital Flows

- **Reserves (indexed)**: Rose from ~20 to peak ~110 (early 1980s), then declined to ~40 by 1990
- Dramatic drawdown during currency defense, partial rebuild during reflation
- **Capital inflows**: Peaked ~6% GDP (early 1980s), fell to **-4% GDP** during crisis
- Reversal to modest inflows during reflation, though never matching bubble-era levels

#### Current Account and Trade

- **Current account**: Swing from **-8% GDP deficit** (1982) to near-balance by mid-1980s
- **Imports**: Peaked ~20% GDP, compressed to **5% GDP** through crisis adjustment
- **Exports**: Rose from ~5% to peak ~16% GDP, then declined to ~7% by 1990
- **Capital outflows**: Peaked ~1.2% GDP during crisis before normalizing

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy

#### Money Supply

- **M0 as % GDP**: Declined from ~4.5% to ~1% by 1990
- Steady erosion reflected **inflation tax** and currency substitution
- Lower real money balances as inflation expectations became embedded

#### Fiscal Position

- **Fiscal deficit**: Widened to **-18% GDP** trough during depression
- Improved during reflation but remained elevated
- Fiscal dominance contributed to ongoing inflation pressures

### Economic Outcomes

#### Real GDP

- Indexed trajectory: Steady rise (1975-1980), **flat/decline** (1980-1983), resumed growth (1983+)
- **Real growth**: Highly volatile, swinging from **+10% to -4%**
- Recovery took 4 years to regain prior peak

#### Output Gap and Inflation

- **GDP gap**: Ranged from **-8% to +7%**, reflecting extreme cyclicality
- Negative gap during depression failed to contain inflation due to FX depreciation pass-through
- Core inflation accelerated throughout, reaching **350%** by 1990

### FX and Gold Markets

- **Real FX vs. TWI**: Peaked ~+90% (early 1980s), crashed to **-120% by 1990**
- Sustained real depreciation through both depression and reflation phases
- **FX return for foreign investors**: Peaked ~110 (indexed), crashed to ~10, partial recovery
- **Gold price (local FX)**: Exponential rise on logarithmic scale—hyperinflationary asset dynamics

### Key Lessons from Brazil 1977-1987

1. **Foreign-currency debt creates amplification**: 70% FX-denominated debt meant currency depreciation worsened solvency
2. **Policy choice matters**: Abandoning currency peg was painful but allowed eventual adjustment; defending would have depleted reserves without resolution
3. **Inflation as deleveraging tool**: Nominal income growth via inflation drove debt-to-GDP reduction, but at cost of **350%+ sustained inflation**
4. **Current account adjustment is essential**: Import compression and export promotion restored external balance
5. **Financial system support critical**: Nationalization and liquidity provision prevented complete collapse
6. **Recovery takes time**: 4 years to regain real GDP peak; equity markets recovered faster (1.9 years)
7. **Risk of inflation spiral**: Brazil's low real rates and FX depreciation created textbook conditions for runaway inflation
8. **IMF programs can help**: External assistance provided credibility and resources during adjustment

## Chile 1978–1995 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase (1978-1981)

**Classic inflationary deleveraging cycle** driven by self-reinforcing dynamics:

- **Debt surge**: Rose 86% of GDP to pre-crisis peak of **145% of GDP**
- **Foreign currency exposure**: 32% of GDP in foreign currencies—massive pullback vulnerability
- **Strong capital inflows**: Investment flows averaged ~14% of GDP, financing 11% current account deficit
- **Growth acceleration**: 7% growth with GDP gap peaking at 11%
- **Asset returns**: Equities averaged **36% annualized returns** during bubble, encouraging more borrowing
- **Competitiveness loss**: Real FX peaked at **+36%**, undermining exports
- **Unsustainable dynamic**: Rising debt + foreign financing dependence + weakened regional conditions = inevitable reversal

### The Depression Phase (1981-1985)

**Self-reinforcing bust triggered by 1980s Latin American Debt Crisis:**

- **Foreign funding collapse**: Capital inflows fell 40% of GDP
- **Monetary tightening**: Policymakers hiked short rates by **31%**
- **Currency crash**: Real FX fell **50%**
- **Economic contraction**: GDP fell 14%, stock prices fell **74%**
- **Inflation spike**: Peaked at **33%** during depression—normal for these cases despite Chile's history of poorly-controlled inflation
- **Financial system stress**: Institutions under considerable pressure
- **Reserve depletion**: Central bank drew down reserves 53% defending currency before abandoning peg
- **Debt paradox**: Debt as % GDP rose 73% (19% annualized) despite deleveraging need—currency fall increased FX debt burden + government borrowed more (peak fiscal deficit 4% of GDP)
- **Debt service crisis**: Reached **45% of GDP** pre-crisis, making Chile vulnerable to shock

**Attribution insight**: Even though Chile needed deleveraging, debt/GDP increased because (1) currency depreciation raised FX-denominated debt burden, (2) government crisis borrowing

### The Reflation Phase (1985-1995)

**Key policy choice**: Let currency go vs. print money to replace capital outflows

Chile's approach after "ugly" phase:
- **Abandoned currency peg**, allowed tightening to flow through
- **Current account improvement**: +11% of GDP from reduced import spending
- **Currency attractiveness restored** through disciplined policy
- **Aggressive financial institution management**: Pulled **5 out of 9 classic policy levers**
  - Provided liquidity
  - Directly purchased troubled assets
  - IMF assistance program
  - Structural reforms for labor market flexibility
- **Debt reduction**: Fell 129% (13% annualized) over adjustment period
- **Deleveraging drivers**: Mostly from nominal income rising, not spending cuts
- **Currency bottom**: Real FX bottomed at **-32%** during "beautiful period"—restored competitiveness
- **Recovery timeline**: 5 years for real GDP to reach prior peak; equity prices in USD terms recovered within 9 years

**Deleveraging attribution (reflation period)**:
- Real growth: negative contribution
- Inflation: large positive contribution
- Change in domestic debt: positive contribution to deleveraging
- FX debt change due to FX move: modest contribution
- Net result: **-13% change in debt/GDP** over 1985-1995

### Key Metrics Summary

## Mexico 1979-1991: Inflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview

- **Classic inflationary deleveraging cycle** from 1979-1991
- Three phases: bubble (1979-1981), depression (1981-1987), reflation (1987-1991)
- Crisis driven by foreign currency debt exposure and capital flow reversals

### The Bubble Phase (1979-1981)

#### Key Vulnerabilities Built Up

- **Debt reached 65% of GDP** at bubble peak
- **26% of GDP was foreign currency debt** — massive FX exposure
- **Capital inflows averaged 8% of GDP** — financing 6% current account deficit
- Strong growth at **9%** with GDP gap peaking at **9%**
- **Real FX appreciated +30%** — competitiveness became critical issue
- Combination of bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + weakened regional conditions = unsustainable

#### The Self-Reinforcing Cycle

- Unsustainably strong capital inflows drove rising debt and strong growth
- Investment inflows financed current account deficits
- High economic activity levels accompanied by deteriorating competitiveness

### The Depression Phase (1981-1987)

#### The Triggering Shock

- **1980s Latin American Debt Crisis** + falling oil prices
- Dynamic reversed into self-reinforcing bust and balance of payments/currency crisis
- Pre-crisis **debt service reached 31% of GDP** — extremely vulnerable

#### The Cascade of Collapses

- **Capital inflows fell 17% of GDP**
- Policymakers **hiked short rates 128%** (tightening)
- **Real FX fell 74%** — meaningful currency decline
- **GDP fell 7%**
- **Stock prices fell 86%**

#### Extreme Inflation Dynamics

- **Inflation peaked at 151%** during depression — very high compared to similar cases
- Mexico had classic "risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals
- **Biggest risk factor: fiscal deficit**
- Currency weakness drove inflation higher

#### Central Bank Reserve Depletion

- Central bank **spent down reserves 66%** defending the currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**
- Even though deleveraging was needed, **debt-to-GDP rose 41%** (7% annualized)

#### Why Debt Rose Despite Needing Deleveraging

- Currency collapse increased burden of **foreign-denominated debts**
- Government borrowed more to respond to crisis
- **Peak fiscal deficit: 13% of GDP**

### The Reflation Phase (1987-1991)

#### Critical Policy Choice

- Key determinant: how policymakers respond to adverse capital flows
- Option 1: Let currency fall + allow financial tightening (painful but typically necessary)
- Option 2: Print money to offset money leaving (inflationary)

#### Mexico's Approach

- **Abandoned the currency peg**
- After "relatively long ugly phase," allowed enough tightening to flow through
- **Current account improved 10% of GDP** — reduced import spending
- Made currency more attractive to hold

#### What Mexico Did NOT Do

- **Not aggressive managing financial institutions and bad debts**
- Only pulled **2 out of 9 classic policy levers**

#### Supporting Factors

- **IMF assistance program**
- **Structural reforms for labor market flexibility**

#### Deleveraging Mechanics

- **Debt-to-GDP fell 31%** (8% annualized) over adjustment period
- Reduction came mostly from **nominal income rising** — not real deleveraging
- Much lower currency (**real FX bottomed at -44%** during "beautiful period") set up renewed competitiveness

#### Recovery Timeline

- **7 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 6 years**

### Attribution Analysis: Depression Period (1981-1987)

#### How Debt Changed Components

- **Real growth**: negative contribution (falling GDP increased debt burden)
- **Inflation**: large negative contribution (inflated away debt in nominal terms)
- **Change in domestic debt**: modest positive contribution
- **FX debt change due to FX move**: large positive contribution (currency collapse increased FX debt burden)
- **Net result: Debt %GDP rose 7% annualized** despite needing to deleverage

### Attribution Analysis: Reflation Period (1987-1991)

#### How Deleveraging Occurred

- **Inflation**: largest contributor to reducing debt burden (inflated nominal income)
- **Real growth**: modest positive contribution
- **Change in domestic debt**: substantial contribution (rising nominal debt in local terms)
- **FX debt changes**: small contributions both from FX moves and other factors
- **Net result: Debt fell -8% annualized**

### Gauges and Metrics

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge

- Composite measure of bubble/depression conditions
- Peaked during bubble phase at ~2.5
- Crashed to depression trough at ~-2.5
- Gradual recovery through reflation phase to ~1.5

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge

- Measures money and credit conditions
- Two major tightening episodes: early period and peak around 1986-1987
- Peak tightening reached ~2.0
- Sharp easing following peak tightening to ~-2.0 (peak easing)
- Crossing zero represents shifting into/out of bubble

### Economic Data Patterns

#### Indebtedness Metrics

- **Total debt**: rose from ~40% GDP to peak of ~85% GDP, then declined to ~60% GDP
- **Debt service**: rose from ~20% GDP to peak of ~120% GDP, fell back to ~40% GDP
- **FX debt**: surged from ~25% GDP to peak of ~80% GDP, then declined to ~30% GDP
- **Debt-GDP ratio change**: highly volatile, ranging from -10% to +15% annually
- **Debt growth %GDP**: peaked above 40% annually during crisis

#### Monetary and Fiscal Policy

- **Nominal short rate**: surged from ~20% to peak near **300%**, then fell to ~50%
- **Money level %GDP**: declined from ~3.5% to trough of ~2.2%, recovered to ~3%
- **Fiscal balance**: deteriorated from -4% GDP to trough of **-13% GDP**, recovered to positive territory

#### Economic Conditions

- **Real GDP**: strong growth during bubble, stagnation during depression, resumed growth in reflation
- **Real growth Y/Y**: peaked at ~10%, fell to ~-5%, recovered to ~6%
- **GDP gap**: peaked at ~9%, fell to ~-4%, recovered to ~3%
- **Core inflation Y/Y**: rose from ~30% to peak near **190%**, fell back to ~30%

#### Interest Rates

- **Nominal long rate**: tracked inflation, rising to peak near **170%**
- **Nominal short rate**: even more extreme, peaking near **300%**
- **Real short rate**: highly volatile, ranging from -100% to +100%

#### Markets

- **Equity prices (USD)**: bubble peak, crash of 86%, strong recovery to 10x initial levels
- **Nominal long/short rates**: both tracked extreme inflation dynamics
- **Real FX vs TWI**: appreciated +30% during bubble, crashed -80%, recovered to +20%
- **FX return for foreign investors**: stable during bubble, crashed during depression, gradual recovery
- **Gold price (local FX)**: exploded during crisis from near-zero to 12,000+ indexed

#### External Position

- **Reserves (USD)**: volatile, ranging from index of 50 to peaks above 400
- **Capital inflows**: surged to peak of ~15% GDP during bubble, reversed to negative during crisis, recovered to ~8% GDP
- **Imports %GDP**: rose from ~18% to peak of ~40%, declined during crisis, recovered to ~22%
- **Current account %GDP**: deteriorated from 0% to -10%, improved during crisis back toward 0%, then declined again to -4%
- **Capital outflows %GDP**: volatile swings from +1% to -6% of GDP

### Key Lessons

- **Foreign currency debt creates extreme vulnerability** to capital flow reversals
- **Currency collapse has dual effect**: inflates away local debt but increases FX debt burden
- **Inflation can deleverage** but at severe economic cost
- **Fiscal deficits are primary inflation risk factor** in these crises
- **Eventually allowing tightening** is typically necessary even if painful
- **Nominal income growth** (via inflation) was the primary deleveraging mechanism
- **Competitiveness gains from currency depreciation** set foundation for recovery
- **Recovery is slow**: 7 years to regain prior GDP peak

## Peru 1980–1986 Case Study

### The Bubble Phase

**Pre-crisis debt accumulation**
- Peru lacked a traditional broad-based domestic bubble but was exposed to bubble conditions in connected economies and markets
- Total debt reached **107% of GDP** prior to crisis
- Foreign currency debt: **106% of GDP** — creating massive FX exposure vulnerability
- Current account deficit: **4% of GDP** — required continuous foreign financing inflows
- High debt levels combined with dependence on foreign capital and contagion from weakened neighboring countries created unsustainable conditions

### The Depression Phase (1982-1985)

**Crisis trigger and impacts**
- Shock came via **1980s Latin American Debt Crisis**
- GDP declined **13%** during depression
- Stock prices fell **56%**
- Unemployment increased **5%**
- Inflation peaked at **190%** during depression — high compared to other cases

**Why inflation spiraled in Peru**
- Peru had most classic "risk factors" for major inflation spirals
- **Low real short rates** were the biggest inflation risk factor
- Financial institutions came under severe pressure

**Central bank and currency dynamics**
- Central bank spent down reserves **44%** attempting currency defense
- Eventually policymakers abandoned currency defense
- Currency depreciated **53%** by end of crisis
- Despite needing deleveraging, debt as % GDP rose **163%** (42% annualized) because:
  - Currency collapse increased foreign-denominated debt burden
  - Government borrowed more to respond to crisis (peak fiscal deficit: **5% of GDP**)

### The Reflation Phase

**Policy response: abandoning the peg**
- Key choice in balance of payments/currency crises: let currency fall and allow tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money to compensate for outflows (inflationary)
- Peru abandoned currency peg after slightly longer than average "ugly" phase
- Allowed enough tightening to reduce import spending — current account balance improved **13% of GDP**
- Made currency more attractive to hold

**Aggressive institutional reforms**
- Peru pulled **3 out of 9 classic policy levers** for managing financial institutions and bad debts
- **Nationalized banks** and provided liquidity
- Received **IMF assistance program**
- Enacted **structural reforms** to increase labor market flexibility

**Deleveraging mechanics**
- Debt as % of GDP fell **88%** (88% annualized) during 1985-1986 reflation period
- Reduction came mostly from **nominal income rising** rather than debt reduction
- Real FX bottomed at **-46%** during the "beautiful period" — set up renewed competitiveness
- Recovery timeline:
  - **4 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
  - **6 years** before equity prices (USD terms) recovered

**Political consequences**
- Crisis helped set stage for **Alan Garcia Perez** to take power — considered a populist leader by many

### Key Metrics Summary

**Bubble Phase Indicators:**
- Exports as % GDP rose from ~8% (1976) to ~18% (1991)
- Bubble & Depression Gauge peaked around 1.5 in early 1980s
- Core inflation climbed from ~50% to peaks of 190% and then 250%

**Depression Attribution (1982-1985):**
- Real growth: negative contribution
- Inflation: large positive contribution (~40-50% of debt change)
- FX debt change due to FX move: major contributor
- Net debt change: **+42% annualized**

**Reflation Attribution (1985-1986):**

- Inflation: largest contributor to deleveraging
- FX effects reduced debt burden
- Net debt change: **-88% annualized**

**Debt dynamics:**
- Total debt peaked around **75% of GDP** (1986), debt service around **250% of GDP**
- FX debt tracked similar pattern, peaking around **260% of GDP**
- Both declined sharply post-1986

**Monetary policy extremes:**
- Nominal short rate reached **100%** at peak (late 1980s)
- Money supply (M0) spiked to **70% of GDP** during crisis period
- Real short rate swung from slightly positive to **-150%** (deeply negative during hyperinflation)

**Market dynamics:**
- Equity prices (USD indexed) collapsed from ~600 to ~50-100 range, then recovered to ~400-500 by early 1990s
- Real FX trade-weighted index fell from 0% to **-100%+** (complete collapse)
- FX return for foreign investors: declined from index ~200 to nearly 0 by 1986
- Gold price in local FX (indexed): exponential rise reflecting hyperinflation — from 10 to 1,000,000+ on log scale

**External position:**
- Reserves (USD indexed): volatile, ranging 40-160, with sharp drawdowns during crisis
- Imports as % GDP: peaked around **28%** (early 1980s), fell to ~12%, recovered to ~22%
- Current account swung from **+4%** surplus to **-12%** deficit and back

## Philippines 1979–1992 Case Study

### Overview

**Crisis type:** Classic **transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle**
- Ran from 1979 to 1992
- Example of country "letting currency go" under external pressure
- Produces temporary inflation but gives policymakers more flexibility to set interest rates

### The Bubble Phase (1979-1982)

**Capital flow dynamics**
- Bubble characterized by **unsustainably strong capital inflows** and strong currency returns
- Debts rose **16% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **77% of GDP**
- Foreign currency debt: **56% of GDP** — large FX exposure
- Investment inflows averaged **9% of GDP** — financed current account deficit of **7% of GDP**

**Growth and competitiveness issues**
- Strong growth: **4%** during bubble
- Economic activity levels high — GDP gap peaked at **9%**
- Real FX peaked at **+18%** — competitiveness became an issue
- Bubble pressures plus dependence on foreign financing = unsustainable

### The Depression Phase (1982-1984)

**Crisis trigger**
- High debt left Philippines vulnerable to shock
<!-- pp. 1061-1080 -->

## Philippines 1979–1992: Depression Phase (continued)

### Crisis Mechanics

- **Capital flight triggers cascade**: Foreign funding fell 9% of GDP, forcing policy makers to hike short rates 34%
- **Currency collapse**: Real FX declined 16%, reinforcing GDP contraction (-11%) and stock market crash (-71%)
- **Inflation spike**: Peaked at 58% during depression—normal for this type of crisis given **Philippines had ~half the classic "risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals**, with high foreign-denominated debts being the biggest risk
- **Financial system stress**: Institutions under considerable pressure; central bank drew down reserves 100% defending currency before eventually abandoning defense
- **Debt dynamics paradox**: Despite needing deleveraging, debt/GDP remained roughly flat through crisis period—neither rising nor falling significantly

### Policy Response Framework: The Currency Decision

> "A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow a tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary)."

- **Philippines chose currency abandonment**: After shorter-than-average "ugly" phase, allowed enough tightening to reduce import spending
- **Current account improvement**: Balanced improved 7% of GDP, making currency more attractive to hold
- **Aggressive financial sector management**: Pulled **7 out of 9 classic policy levers**:
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity
  - Directly purchased troubled assets
  - IMF assistance program
  - Structural reforms to increase labor market flexibility

### Reflation Phase (1984-1992)

- **Deleveraging through nominal growth**: Debt/GDP fell 9% (1% annualized) over adjustment period
- **Reduction mechanism**: Came mostly from nominal income rising, not real deleveraging
- **Currency competitiveness**: Lower currency (real FX bottoming at -19% during beautiful period) set up renewed competitiveness
- **Recovery timeline**:
  - 6 years before real GDP reached prior peak
  - 5 years for equity prices in USD terms to recover

### Attribution Charts: Depression vs. Reflation

**Depression period (1982-1984)**:
- Debt %GDP: 0% (flat)
- Dominated by: FX debt change due to FX move (large negative contribution from currency collapse increasing foreign debt burden)
- Real growth: negative contribution
- Inflation: large negative deleveraging effect

**Reflation period (1984-1992)**:
- Debt %GDP: -1% net change
- Change in domestic debt: positive (green, largest component)
- FX debt change due to FX move: moderate positive
- Inflation: large negative contribution (inflating away debt)
- Real growth: moderate positive contribution

## Malaysia 1981–1990 Case Auto-Summary

**Classification**: Transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle (1981-1990)

**Key characteristic**: Classic example of **"letting currency go"** in face of external pressures—produces temporary inflation but gives policy makers more flexibility to set interest rates

### The Bubble Phase (1981-1984)

- **Debt buildup**: Rose 40% of GDP to pre-crisis peak of **153% of GDP**
- **Foreign currency exposure**: **42% of GDP in foreign currencies**—large pullback risk
- **Capital inflows**: Strong at ~14% of GDP, financing 10% current account deficit
- **Growth**: Strong at 7% with high economic activity (GDP gap peaked at 3%)
- **Competitiveness erosion**: Real FX peaked at +20% (overvalued)
- **Unsustainable dynamics**: Bubble pressures + dependence on foreign financing + weakened conditions in related countries

### The Depression Phase (1984-1987)

- **Trigger**: Commodity price declines hitting exports
- **Capital flight**: Inflows fell 11% of GDP
- **Currency collapse**: Real FX fell 19%
- **Economic contraction**: Stock prices fell 56%, unemployment rose 2%
- **Financial stress**: Institutions under considerable pressure
- **Central bank response**: Drew down reserves 26% defending currency, eventually abandoned defense
- **Debt paradox**: Despite needing deleveraging, debt/GDP rose **43% (17% annualized)**
  - Currency fall increased foreign-denominated debt burden
  - Government borrowing increased (fiscal deficit peaked at 10% of GDP)
<!-- pp. 1081-1100 -->

## Malaysia 1981-1990: The Reflation Phase (continued)

### Policy Response to Capital Flight: Currency vs. Inflation Tradeoff

- **Critical policy choice**: how to respond to adverse capital flows
  - Option 1: Let currency depreciate, allow financial tightening (painful but typically necessary)
  - Option 2: Print money to offset capital flight (inflationary risk)
- **Malaysia's approach**: Abandoned currency peg after slightly shorter than average "ugly" phase
  - Allowed sufficient tightening to reduce import spending
  - Current account improved by **9% of GDP**
  - Currency became more attractive to hold

### Aggressive Deleveraging Execution

- **Policy levers deployed**: 5 out of 9 classic tools
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity to financial system
  - Managed bad debts aggressively
- **Debt reduction**: Total debt fell **74% (21% annualized)** during adjustment period
- **Mechanism**: Reduction primarily from **nominal income rising** (real growth driver), not deflation

### Recovery Dynamics

- **Currency competitiveness**: Real FX bottomed at **-12%** during "beautiful period"
  - Set foundation for renewed export competitiveness
- **GDP recovery timeline**: **1.8 years** to reach prior peak
- **Equity market recovery**: USD-denominated stock prices recovered within **6 years**

### Deleveraging Attribution (Reflation Period 1987-1990)

- Total debt/GDP decline: **-21%** annualized
- **Primary driver**: Real growth (largest component in chart)
- Domestic debt reduction and FX effects also contributed
- Modest inflation contribution compared to other cases

## Peru 1986-1995: Hyperinflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### The Bubble Phase (1986-1987)

**Debt dynamics:**
- Debt rose **55% of GDP** during bubble
- Pre-crisis peak: **184% of GDP**
- **Critical vulnerability**: High foreign currency exposure (**182% of GDP**)
  - Left Peru extremely exposed to capital flight risk

**Growth and activity:**
- Strong growth: **5%** annually
- GDP gap peaked at **11%** (economy running very hot)
- Current account deficit: **3% of GDP**

**Asset returns feedback loop:**
- Equities averaged **124% annualized returns** during bubble
- Strong returns encouraged more borrowing
- Self-reinforcing cycle of debt, equity gains, and growth
- **Unsustainable situation**: Dependence on foreign financing created fragility

### The Depression Phase (1987-1990)

**Trigger event:**
- Peru's leadership **refused to cooperate with international creditors**
- High debt levels left country vulnerable to this shock

**Economic collapse:**
- GDP fell **30%**
- Stock prices fell **91%**
- Financial institutions under "considerable pressure"

**Deleveraging paradox:**
- Despite ugly deleveraging, debt/GDP **fell 106% (30% annualized)**
- **Mechanism**: Reduction came from **income rising primarily through higher inflation**
- Nominal income growth offset debt burden despite real economic contraction

### Measurement Framework: Bubble & Depression Gauges

**Purpose**: Rough measures of cycle position
- First two charts show gauges measuring bubble/depression conditions
- Tightness/easiness of money and credit
- **Interpretation**: Distance from zero = extent of bubble; crossing zero = shift in/out of bubble

**Peru's gauge readings:**
- Clear bubble peak in 1986
- Sharp depression trough 1987-1990
- Reflation phase begins ~1991

### The Reflation Phase (1990-1995)

**Initial policy choice:**
- Insufficient tightening before falling into **hyperinflation spiral**
- Real FX bottomed at **-115%** (massive currency collapse)
- Inflation peaked at **over 10,000%**

**Risk factors for hyperinflation:**
- Peru had most classic "risk factors" for severe inflation spirals
- **Biggest risk**: Low real short-term interest rates
- Declining exchange rates and hyperinflation reinforced each other

**Policy response (somewhat aggressive):**
- Deployed **3 out of 9** typical policy levers
- **Nationalized banks**
- **Provided liquidity**
- Enacted **structural reforms** for labor market flexibility

**Critical turning point:**
- Stopping hyperinflation required "significant structural changes"
- **Abandoned hyperinflated inti, adopted sol in 1991**
- Major monetary reform essential to break spiral

**Recovery timeline:**
- **9 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Much longer than Malaysia's 1.8 years
- Reflects severity of hyperinflationary path

### Deleveraging Attribution (Reflation Period 1990-1995)

- Total debt/GDP decline: **-9%** over period
- **Massive inflation component** (pink bar dominates chart)
- FX debt changes due to currency movements
- Small positive contribution from real growth
- Inflation eroded debt burden but at enormous economic cost

---

## Comparative Lessons: Malaysia vs. Peru

**Malaysia 1981-1990:**
- Abandoned peg early, allowed tightening
- Deleveraged via real growth primarily
- Fast recovery (1.8 years to GDP peak)
- Avoided hyperinflation

**Peru 1986-1995:**
- Insufficient tightening initially
- Fell into hyperinflation (>10,000%)
- Deleveraged via inflation eroding debt
- Slow recovery (9 years to GDP peak)
- Required radical monetary reform (new currency)

**Key insight**: Policy response to capital flight determines path—controlled adjustment (painful but quick) vs. hyperinflationary spiral (devastating and prolonged)

## Argentina 1987-1993: Hyperinflationary Deleveraging Case Study

### Overview: Classic Hyperinflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- **Argentina** experienced a hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987-1993
- Pattern followed: bubble phase → depression phase → reflation phase
- Distinguishing feature: unlike many cases, Argentina lacked a broad-based domestic bubble before crisis
- However, connected to other economies/markets experiencing bubble-like conditions
- Built substantial **debt stock**: rose 15% of GDP to peak of **70% of GDP** during leveraging-up period
- Critical vulnerability: **39% of GDP in foreign currency debt** — created massive exposure to foreign capital pullbacks

### The Bubble Phase: Debt Accumulation Without Domestic Bubble

- No broad-based domestic bubble in traditional sense
- Debt accumulation nonetheless: from baseline to 70% of GDP
- **Foreign currency exposure** (39% of GDP) created structural weakness
- High debt + structural economic weaknesses = unsustainable situation
- Tied to external economies experiencing bubble conditions

### The Depression Phase (1987-1990)

#### The Trigger: Commodity Shock and Capital Flight

- Crisis triggered by **commodity price declines** hitting exports
- **Capital inflows collapsed**: fell 4% of GDP
- Policy response: **short-rate hikes exceeding 250%**
- **Currency collapse**: real FX fell 60%

#### Economic Devastation

- **GDP contraction**: fell 16%
- **Stock prices crashed**: down 33%
- **Unemployment surged**: increased 3%
- Currency weakness drove **extreme inflation** (rising sharply)
- Financial institutions under severe pressure

#### Central Bank Defense and Deleveraging

- Central bank **spent down reserves 26%** attempting to defend currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**
- Despite ugly deleveraging, Argentina **reduced debt-to-GDP by 30%** (11% annualized) during this period
- Deleveraging source: primarily **income rising** (driven by higher inflation), not growth
- Attribution chart shows inflation as dominant factor in debt ratio reduction

#### Gauges and Metrics

- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: showed shift from mild bubble territory into deep depression, then reflation
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: peak tightening reached ~2.0, followed by peak easing around -1.5
- **Core inflation**: spiked to extraordinary levels (chart shows peaks over 2000% Y/Y)

### The Reflation Phase (1990-1993)

#### Policy Response Decision Point

- Key question in balance-of-payments crises: how do policymakers respond to capital outflows?
  - Option 1: Allow financial tightening to flow through (painful but typically necessary)
  - Option 2: Print money to compensate (inflationary)
- Argentina initially chose insufficient tightening → **spiral of declining exchange rates and hyperinflation**

#### Hyperinflation Dynamics

- **Real FX bottomed at -135%** (massive currency depreciation)
- **Inflation peaked over 10,000%**
- Makes sense given Argentina had ~half the classic **"risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals**
- **Biggest risk factor**: long history of poorly-controlled inflation

#### Policy Interventions: Mixed Approach

- **Financial institution management**: aggressive, pulling **3 out of 9 typical policy levers**
- **Bad debt handling**: actively managed
- Benefited from **IMF assistance program**
- Enacted **structural reforms** for labor market flexibility
- Classic challenge: **stopping the inflationary spiral** required more fundamental changes

#### Structural Transformation

- Ultimately required **significant structural changes**:
  - **Abandoned hyperinflated austral** currency
  - Adopted **current Argentine peso**
  - Initially **pegged to US dollar**
- Recovery timeline:
  - **4 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
  - **2 years** for equity prices in USD terms to recover

#### Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period (1990-1993)

- Debt increase of **7% of GDP** during reflation
- Attribution breakdown shows:
  - Inflation contribution (negative, reducing debt burden)
  - FX debt changes due to FX moves
  - Real growth contribution
  - Change in domestic debt

### Political Impact

- Crisis had **notable political impact**
- Helped set stage for **Carlos Menem** to take power
- Many consider Menem a **populist leader**
- Crisis created political opening for significant leadership change

### Visual Data Summary

#### Monetary and Fiscal Policy Charts

- **Nominal short rate**: extreme spikes to 500%+ during crisis (1987-1993)
- **Money0 level** (% GDP): peaked around 70% during crisis, fell sharply
- **Fiscal balance** (% GDP): fluctuated -5% to +4%, generally deteriorated through mid-1990s

#### Economic Conditions Charts

- **Real GDP** (indexed): deep V-shaped recovery from ~70 to above 105
- **Real growth** (Y/Y): volatility from -25% to +15%, severe negative spike 1989-1990
- **GDP gap**: ranged -15% to +15%, showed extreme overheating then collapse
- **Core inflation**: extraordinary spikes over 400-500% during hyperinflationary period
- **Nominal long rate vs. nominal growth**: both tracked together at extreme levels (400-500%)
- **Real short rate**: plunged below -200% during hyperinflation

#### Markets Charts

- **Equity prices USD** (indexed): remained flat ~100 until 1991, then explosive rise to 1000+ by 1996
- **Nominal long/short rates**: synchronized spikes to 500%+ during crisis
- **Real FX vs TWI**: collapsed to -120% during crisis, gradual recovery
- **FX return for foreign investors**: index collapsed from 200 to near 0 by 1991
- **Gold price** (local FX, indexed): exponential rise on logarithmic scale reflecting currency collapse

#### External Position Charts

- **Reserves** (USD, indexed): fell from ~150 to ~50 during crisis, then surged to 400+ by 1996
- **Capital inflows** (% GDP): negligible pre-crisis, surged to 14-15% by mid-1990s
- **Imports** (% GDP): fluctuated 10-30%, rose significantly post-crisis
- **Current account** (% GDP): improved from -12% deficit to near 0%, then deteriorated again
- **Capital outflows** (% GDP): peaked around 6%, highly volatile
- **Exports** (% GDP): relatively stable 15-20% range

#### Indebtedness Charts

- **Total debt** (% GDP): peaked ~70%, debt service ~12% GDP
- **FX debt** (% GDP): peaked near 65%, declined significantly during deleveraging
- **Change in debt-GDP ratio** (ann): volatile swings from -10% to +10%
- **Debt growth** (% GDP, ann): peaked ~30%, declined to under 10%

### Key Lessons

- **Foreign currency debt** creates existential vulnerability in crisis
- **Insufficient tightening** + **money printing** = hyperinflationary spiral
- **Structural reforms** (currency change, IMF assistance, labor flexibility) necessary but took time
- **Historical inflation problems** compound crisis severity
- **Political consequences** can be profound — crises create openings for populist leaders
- **Recovery possible but slow**: 4 years to restore real GDP, significant structural transformation required

## Brazil 1987–1995 Case Study: Hyperinflationary Deleveraging

### Overview

**Brazil** experienced a **classic hyperinflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1987 and 1995, demonstrating the self-reinforcing dynamics of bubble formation, depression, and ultimately hyperinflation-driven reflation.

### The Bubble Phase (1987-1990)

#### Debt Dynamics
- Debt rose **69% of GDP** during bubble, reaching pre-crisis peak of **177% of GDP**
- **26% of GDP was foreign currency debt** — creating massive FX exposure vulnerability
- Capital inflows averaged **-3% of GDP** (outflows) during bubble period despite rising debt

#### Growth and Economic Activity
- Growth strong at **3%** during bubble phase
- **GDP gap peaked at 7%** — economy running very hot
- High levels of economic activity fueled by debt-driven spending

#### Asset Returns and Currency
- Equities averaged **16% annualized returns** during bubble — encouraging more borrowing
- **Real FX peaked at +35%** appreciation
- Strong asset returns created self-reinforcing cycle: rising debt → growth → asset gains → more borrowing
- **Competitiveness became a major issue** due to currency strength

#### Sustainability Issues
> "Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation."

The bubble was fundamentally unstable: high foreign currency debt, capital outflows, currency overvaluation, and contagion risk from neighboring countries.

### The Depression Phase (1990-1991)

#### The Trigger
- **Collapse of price control regulations** and resulting **inflation shock**
- High debt levels left Brazil vulnerable to any negative shock
- Dynamic reversed into self-reinforcing bust and **balance of payments/currency crisis**

#### Economic Contraction
- GDP fell **7%** during depression
- Stock prices collapsed **70%**
- Unemployment rose **4%**
- Self-reinforcing declines across all metrics

#### Currency and Reserves
- Central bank **drew down reserves 28%** defending the currency
- By end, policymakers **abandoned currency defense**
- Currency ultimately fell **19%**
- Real short rates spiked to **1000%+** at peak

#### Debt Burden Increases
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt/GDP rose 40% (37% annualized)**
- Increased because:
  1. **Currency depreciation** increased burden of FX-denominated debts
  2. **Government borrowing** to respond to crisis (peak fiscal deficit **19% of GDP**)

#### Financial System Stress
- **Financial institutions under considerable pressure**
- Banking system fragility added to economic weakness

### Attribution of Debt Changes

The **Deleveraging Attribution charts** reveal the composition of debt changes:

**Depression Period (1990-1991):**
- Total debt change: **+37% annualized** (debt rose despite contraction)
- Major components:
  - **FX Debt Change due to FX Move** (currency depreciation mechanically increased FX debt burden)
  - **Change in Domestic Debt** (government crisis borrowing)
  - **Real Growth** was negative but overwhelmed by other factors
  - **Inflation** contributed to nominal debt increase

### The Reflation Phase (1991-1995)

#### Policy Response Choice
> "A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse capital flows: whether they allow a tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary)."

**Brazil chose insufficient tightening**, leading to hyperinflationary spiral.

#### Hyperinflation Dynamics
- **Real FX bottomed at -16%** (massive depreciation)
- **Inflation peaked over 5,000%** year-over-year
- **Core inflation** hit extreme levels shown in charts
- **Nominal growth** reached **4000%+** at peaks
- **Nominal short rates** exceeded **4000%**

#### Why Hyperinflation?
Brazil had **classic "risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals**:
1. **Long history of poorly-controlled inflation** — worst risk factor
2. **High foreign currency debt exposure**
3. **Weak financial institutions**

#### Policy Actions Taken
- **2 out of 9 typical policy levers** pulled — inadequate response
- Brazil was **not aggressive in managing financial institutions and bad debts**
- Received **IMF assistance program**
- Enacted **structural reforms for labor market flexibility**

#### Ultimate Resolution
> "Stopping the inflationary spiral ultimately required Brazil to make more significant structural changes, including abandoning the hyperinflated cruzado and adopting first the cruzeiro and then the modern real in 1994."

- Required **abandoning hyperinflated cruzado currency**
- Introduced **cruzeiro**, then **modern real (1994)**
- Took **1.4 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 3 years**

### Reflation Attribution (1991-1995)

**Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period**
- Total debt change: **-27%** over period (successful deleveraging through inflation)
- Composition:
  - **Inflation** was dominant force reducing real debt burden (largest component)
  - **Change in Domestic Debt** (some real reduction)
  - **FX Debt Changes** (both from FX moves and other factors)
  - Real growth contribution visible but secondary

### Gauges and Summary Metrics

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge
- Shows clear bubble formation (1987-1989)
- Sharp transition to depression (1990-1991)
- Extended reflation period (1991-1995+)
- Gauge crosses from positive to deeply negative during crisis

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge
- **Peak Tightening** around 1989-1990 crisis
- **Peak Easing** in early 1990s
- Gradual normalization through mid-1990s

#### Core Inflation
- Spike to **~10,000% Y/Y** at 1989-1990 peak
- Second spike to **~5,000%** around 1993-1994
- Demonstrates multiple waves of hyperinflation before stabilization

### Market Behavior

#### Equity Prices
- Rose dramatically during bubble (indexed from ~100 to 1,100+)
- Collapsed **70%** during depression
- Volatile recovery through 1990s
- Reached ~1,000 index level by late 1990s

#### Interest Rates
- **Nominal long and short rates** hit **2000%** during crisis peaks
- Multiple spikes corresponding to inflation waves
- Real short rate showed extreme volatility (±1000% range)

#### FX and External Position
- **Real FX vs TWI** fell from +40% overvaluation to -120% undervaluation
- **FX Return for Foreign Investors** volatile: peaked ~130 index, crashed to ~10
- **Gold price in local FX** increased exponentially (from 0.1 to 1,000,000+ indexed) — classic hyperinflation hedge

### External Accounts

#### Reserves and Capital Flows
- **Reserves (USD)** rose from index ~100 to 600+ through 1990s (rebuilt after crisis)
- **Capital Inflows** shifted from slight outflows to **+18% of GDP** by late 1990s
- Foreign capital returned as reforms took hold

#### Trade Balance
- **Imports** fell to **~3% of GDP** during crisis (1990), then rose to **18% by 1999**
- **Current Account** swung from small surplus to **-6% of GDP** deficit by late 1990s
- **Capital Outflows** peaked around **-8% of GDP** during crisis, then reversed
- **Exports** bottomed around **5% of GDP**, recovered to **16% by 1999**

### Key Lessons

1. **Foreign currency debt creates amplification**: When currency falls, FX debt burden rises mechanically
2. **Insufficient tightening prolongs crisis**: Half-measures led to multi-year hyperinflation
3. **Institutional credibility matters**: History of inflation made spiral worse
4. **Structural reform eventually required**: Currency changes, IMF program, labor reforms all needed
5. **Recovery takes time**: 1.4 years to GDP recovery, 3 years for equity markets in USD terms
6. **Attribution matters**: Understanding components of debt changes reveals crisis mechanics

### Data Presentation

The case study includes comprehensive chart deck showing:
- **Economic Conditions**: Real GDP, growth, GDP gap, core inflation, nominal rates
- **Markets**: Equity prices, interest rates, yield curves, FX indicators, gold
- **External Position**: Reserves, capital flows, imports, current account, exports
- **Debt Metrics**: Total debt, FX debt, debt service, debt growth
- **Policy Variables**: Fiscal balance, money supply, short/long rates

**Gauges provide rough composite measures** of bubble/depression conditions and monetary tightness, showing phase transitions clearly.

## Turkey 1990–1995 Case Auto-Summary

### The Bubble Phase

- **No broad-based bubble** in years before crisis, but substantial debt buildup to 41% of GDP
- **26% of GDP in foreign currency debt** — large exposure to foreign capital pullback risk
- **Foreign financing dependency**: investment inflows averaging 2% of GDP pre-crisis
- High debts + foreign financing dependence = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1993-1994)

#### Crisis Trigger
- Government moves to undermine **central bank independence** triggered the crisis
- **Capital inflows collapsed** by 8% of GDP
- Policy makers hiked **short rates by 203%** (tightening response)
- **Real FX fell 26%** — meaningful currency decline
- **GDP fell 12%**, **stock prices fell 70%**

#### Inflation Dynamics
- Currency weakness drove **inflation to 117%** peak during depression
- High compared to similar cases despite Turkey having only ~25% of classic "risk factors" for major inflation spirals
- Biggest inflation risk factor: long history of poorly-controlled inflation

#### Financial System Pressure
- **Central bank spent down reserves 99%** defending currency before abandoning defense
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- **Debt-to-GDP rose 9% (17% annualized)** during depression despite deleveraging need
- Currency depreciation increased burden of foreign-denominated debt

### The Reflation Phase (1994-1995)

#### Policy Response Choice
- Key choice: allow tightening to flow through (painful but necessary) vs. print money (inflationary)
- After short "ugly" phase, policy makers **allowed enough tightening** to resolve crisis
- **Current account improved 5% of GDP** via reduced import spending
- Currency became more attractive to hold

#### Debt Management
- Turkey **aggressive on bad debts**: pulled 3 of 9 classic policy levers
- **IMF assistance program** provided support
- **Debt-to-GDP fell 11% (7% annualized)** over adjustment period
- Reduction mostly from **nominal income rising**, not debt reduction

#### Recovery Metrics
- **Real FX bottomed at -21%** during beautiful period — set up renewed competitiveness
- **1.6 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 4 years**

### Gauges and Metrics

## Mexico 1991-2005 Case Study

### Case Overview: Classic Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- Mexico experienced a complete debt cycle between 1991-2005: bubble, crisis, and reflation phases
- **Inflationary deleveraging** distinguished this case from deflationary cases
- Timeline: bubble (1991-1994) → depression/crisis (1994-1995) → reflation (1995-2005)

### The Bubble Phase (1991-1994)

#### Debt Accumulation Dynamics

- **Debt rose 10% of GDP** during bubble, reaching **85% of GDP** pre-crisis peak
- **25% of GDP was foreign currency debt** — creating major vulnerability to capital flight
- Self-reinforcing cycle: capital inflows → rising debt → strong equity returns → growth
- **Capital inflows averaged ~8% of GDP**, financing **7% of GDP current account deficit**

#### Economic Conditions During Bubble

- **Strong growth at 4%** with **GDP gap peaking at 3%** (economy running hot)
- **Equity returns averaged 25% annualized** over the bubble period
- Investment inflows around 8% of GDP sustained the expansion
- High levels of economic activity created unsustainable situation given foreign financing dependence

#### Key Vulnerability

> Mexico's dependence on foreign financing created an unsustainable situation

- Large share of foreign currency debt (25% of GDP) left Mexico exposed to capital pullback
- Current account deficit of 7% of GDP required continuous foreign capital inflows
- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing, feeding the bubble

### The Depression Phase (1994-1995)

#### Trigger: Political Violence Shock

- Crisis triggered by **outbreak of political violence** (not purely economic)
- High debt levels left Mexico vulnerable when shock arrived
- Self-reinforcing bust and balance of payments/currency crisis ensued

#### Economic Collapse

- **GDP fell 10%** during depression phase
- **Stock prices crashed 66%**
- **Unemployment increased 3%**
- Financial institutions came under considerable pressure

#### Currency Crisis Dynamics

- **Currency fell 37%** despite intervention efforts
- Central bank **spent down reserves 100%** trying to defend the currency
- Eventually policymakers abandoned currency defense
- Currency weakness drove **inflation to 43% peak** during depression

#### Inflation Characteristics

- 43% peak inflation was **normal for this type of crisis**
- Mexico had **~half the classic "risk factors"** for bigger inflation spirals
- **Biggest risk factor: long history of poorly-controlled inflation**
- Makes sense given Mexico's inflationary history

#### Debt-to-GDP Ratio Remained Flat

- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt as % GDP roughly flat** through depression period
- Inflation offset nominal debt burden (inflationary deleveraging mechanism)
- Attribution chart shows minimal change in debt/GDP ratio during 1994-1995

### The Reflation Phase (1995-2005)

#### Policy Response: Currency Adjustment + Aggressive Bank Management

- Key choice: **let currency go vs. print money vs. tighten**
- Mexico chose to **abandon currency peg** after initial defense
- After "ugly phase," allowed **enough tightening to reduce import spending**
- **Current account improved 7% of GDP** through reduced imports

#### Aggressive Financial Institution Management

- Pulled **6 out of 9 classic policy levers** for bank crisis management:
  - **Nationalized banks**
  - **Provided liquidity**
  - **Directly purchased troubled assets**
- Also benefited from **IMF assistance program**
- Enacted **structural reforms for labor market flexibility**

#### Deleveraging Through Nominal Growth

- **Debt/GDP fell 41%** over reflation period (**4% annualized reduction**)
- Reduction came **mostly from nominal income rising** (inflation + real growth)
- Not from actual debt paydown — inflationary mechanism at work

#### Currency Competitiveness Reset

- **Real FX bottomed at -26%** during the "beautiful period"
- Much lower currency set up Mexico for **renewed competitiveness**
- Exports as % GDP rose from ~12% to ~22% by 2005

#### Recovery Timeline

- **Took 2 years** for real GDP to reach prior peak
- **Equity prices in USD terms recovered within 10 years**
- FX returns for foreign investors eventually exceeded pre-crisis levels

#### Deleveraging Attribution (1995-2005)

- Real growth (negative impact on debt ratio shown as blue)
- Inflation (substantial pink/orange section) — major deleveraging force
- Change in domestic debt (green) — modest contribution
- FX debt changes from currency moves and other factors
- Net result: **-4% annual debt/GDP reduction**

### Chart Deck Data: Key Metrics

#### Indebtedness

- Total debt peaked ~45% GDP (1994-1995), fell to ~35% by 2005
- Debt service peaked over 100% GDP equivalent measure during crisis
- FX debt reached ~40% GDP peak, declined to ~20% by 2005
- Debt growth spiked ~20% annual during bubble, normalized to ~5% by 2005

#### Monetary Policy

- **Nominal short rates spiked to ~110%** during crisis (1995)
- Rates gradually normalized from ~40% to under 10% by 2005
- Money supply (M0) as % GDP dropped during crisis, recovered steadily to ~3% by 2005

#### Fiscal Position

- Fiscal balance improved from -4% GDP (early 1990s) to slight surplus (~5% GDP peak 1992)
- Returned to near-balanced position (~0 to -1% GDP) through reflation period

#### Economic Indicators

- Real GDP: sharp V-shaped recovery after 10% drop
- GDP gap plunged to -10%, recovered to positive territory by late 1990s
- Core inflation: 43% peak (1995), declined steadily to ~5% by 2005
- Real short rate spiked to ~90% during crisis peak

#### Markets

- Equity prices (USD): 66% crash, full recovery by mid-2000s
- Nominal rates (short/long): extreme spike to 110% short rate during crisis
- Yield curve showed severe inversion during crisis period
- Real FX vs TWI: -40% trough during crisis, partial recovery
- Gold price in local FX terms: massive spike during crisis (indexed to ~250), stabilized

#### External Position

- Reserves: 100% drawdown during crisis, rebuilt 7-8x by 2005
- Capital inflows: -2% GDP during crisis, recovered to ~3% GDP
- Imports: rose from ~15% GDP to ~25-30% GDP by 2005
- Current account: improved from -7% deficit to near-balance
- Capital outflows: volatile, ranging -3% to +3% GDP

### Gauges: Measuring Bubble/Depression Dynamics

#### Bubble & Depression Gauge

- Composite measure of money/credit conditions and tightness/easiness
- Clear bubble peak (1.5+) before 1994
- Sharp plunge to depression (-2.0 trough) in 1994-1995
- Gradual reflation back toward neutral through 2005

#### Tightening & Easing Gauge

- Peak tightening (~1.2) during 1994-1995 crisis
- Gradual shift to peak easing (~-0.5) by mid-2000s
- Measures policy stance shifts relative to neutral

#### Core Inflation

- Visual confirmation of 43% peak (1995)
- Steady disinflation from 30%+ (early 1990s) to ~5% by 2005

### Key Lessons from Mexico Case

#### Critical Policy Choice in Currency Crisis

- **Whether to let currency go vs. print money vs. tighten** determines crisis path
- Mexico initially defended (spending reserves), then abandoned peg
- Allowing tightening was "painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis"
- Alternative (printing money) "can be inflationary"

#### Inflationary Deleveraging Mechanism

- Debt/GDP can fall even without nominal debt reduction
- **Inflation + nominal growth reduces debt burden** as % of rising GDP
- Mexico's debt/GDP fell 4% annually through this mechanism during reflation
- Contrasts with deflationary deleveraging where debt/GDP rises despite austerity

#### Vulnerability Factors

- **Foreign currency debt exposure** (25% of GDP) amplified crisis
- **Current account deficit** (7% of GDP) required ongoing capital inflows
- **History of inflation** made inflation spiral more likely
- Political shock can trigger crisis when underlying vulnerabilities exist

#### Effective Crisis Management

- **Aggressive bank intervention** (6 of 9 policy levers deployed)
- **IMF assistance** supplemented domestic response
- **Structural reforms** (labor market flexibility) supported recovery
- **Currency depreciation** (-26% real FX) restored competitiveness
- Combined approach enabled relatively quick recovery (2 years to GDP peak)

## Bulgaria 1995-2003: Hyperinflationary Deleveraging

### The Bubble Phase

- **Bulgaria** did not experience a broad-based bubble before the crisis, but built up substantial debt stock
- **82% of GDP in foreign currency debt** created large exposure to foreign capital pullback
- Current account deficit of **4%** reflected dependence on continuous foreign financing
- High debts plus foreign financing dependency created unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1995-1997)

#### Initial Shock and Currency Crisis
- Wave of losses from over-indebted companies/banks triggered the downturn
- Foreign funding collapsed: **capital inflows fell by 6% of GDP**
- Policy tightening: **short rates hiked by 228%**
- **Real FX fell by 96%** — massive currency decline
- **GDP fell by 13%** in self-reinforcing spiral
- Currency weakness drove very high and rising inflation
- Central bank spent down **75% of reserves** defending currency before abandoning defense

#### Deleveraging Attribution During Depression
- Debt-to-GDP rose **13%** despite deleveraging need
- Breakdown: large inflation component, FX debt increases from currency collapse
- Real growth negative, domestic debt changes modest
- **FX debt burden increased** as currency fell, offsetting other deleveraging efforts

### The Reflation Phase (1997-2003)

#### Policy Response — The Tightening Trap
- Key decision point: allow tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money (inflationary)
- Bulgaria's initial tightening insufficient → fell into **hyperinflation spiral**
- **Real FX bottomed at -63%**, **inflation peaked over 500%**

> "Bulgaria had most of the classic 'risk factors' for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being a long history of poorly-controlled inflation)."

#### Aggressive Policy Response
- **Pulled 5 out of 9 typical policy levers**:
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity
  - Directly purchased troubled assets
  - Received **IMF assistance program**
  - Managed financial institutions and bad debts aggressively

#### Structural Reform Required
- Stopping inflation spiral required **significant structural changes beyond initial measures**
- **Redenominated the lev**, pegging it to the **Deutsche Mark**
- Backed new currency by **foreign exchange reserves**
- **8 years** before real GDP reached prior peak — extended recovery period

#### Risk Factors for Hyperinflation
- Bulgaria possessed classic risk factors for inflation spirals
- **History of poorly-controlled inflation** = biggest risk factor
- Made hyperinflation outcome more likely when crisis hit

## Thailand 1993-2004: Transitory Inflationary Deleveraging

### Overview
- Classic example of **"letting currency go"** in face of external pressures
- Produces temporary inflation but gives policymakers **more flexibility to set interest rates**
- Transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle (1993-2004)

### The Bubble Phase (1993-1996)

#### Bubble Drivers
- Self-reinforcing cycle: **unsustainably strong capital inflows** + rising debt + strong equity returns + strong growth
- **Debts rose by 44% of GDP** during bubble, reaching pre-crisis peak of **183% of GDP**
- **51% of GDP in foreign currency debt** — large FX exposure to capital pullback
- Investment inflows strong: **averaged 15% of GDP**
- Financed **current account deficit of 9% of GDP**

#### Economic Strength During Bubble
- **Growth at 8%** — strong real economic performance
- **GDP gap peaked at 8%** — high levels of economic activity
- **Equities averaged 12% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing and stimulated growth
- Bubble pressures plus foreign financing dependency = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1996-1998)

#### Crisis Trigger and Initial Impact
- Debt service reached **49% of GDP** at pre-crisis peak — extreme vulnerability
- Shock came as **wave of losses from over-indebted companies/banks**
- Foreign funding collapsed: **capital inflows fell by 34% of GDP**
- Policy tightening: **short rates hiked by 11%**
- **Real FX fell by 19%** — meaningful currency decline
- **GDP fell by 14%**, stock prices **fell by 87%** — self-reinforcing declines

#### Inflation Response — Moderate Outcome
- Currency weakness contributed to moderate and rising inflation
- Inflation **peaked at 8%** during depression phase
- **Low compared to other similar cases** — Thailand avoided hyperinflation

> "That makes sense given that Thailand had only about a quarter of the classic 'risk factors' for bigger inflation spirals (with the biggest risk factor being their current account deficit)."

#### Central Bank Defense and Abandonment
- Central bank spent down **100% of reserves** defending currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**
- Financial institutions came under considerable pressure

#### Deleveraging Paradox
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt-to-GDP rose by 36%** (18% annualized)
- Driven partly by **currency collapse increasing foreign-denominated debt burden**
- Attribution chart shows FX component significantly increased debt burden

### Recovery Dynamics
- Thailand's limited inflation risk factors (only ~25% of classic risks)
- **Current account deficit** = biggest risk factor present
- Moderate inflation gave more policy flexibility than hyperinflationary cases like Bulgaria


<!-- pp. 1201-1220 -->

## Thailand 1993-2004 Case (continued)

### The Reflation Phase

#### Policy Response to Capital Outflows

- **Critical policy choice**: Let currency depreciate and allow financial tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money to replace outflows (inflationary)
- **Thailand's approach**: Abandoned currency peg after shorter-than-average "ugly" phase
- Allowed sufficient tightening to reduce import spending — **current account improved by 21% of GDP**
- Made currency more attractive to hold through adjustment process

#### Aggressive Financial Sector Management

Thailand deployed **8 out of 9 classic policy levers**:
- **Nationalized banks** to stabilize system
- **Provided liquidity** to prevent collapse
- **Directly purchased troubled assets** to clean balance sheets
- Received **IMF assistance program** for external support

#### Deleveraging Dynamics (1996-1998)

**Debt reduction**: Debt/GDP fell **88%** (15% annualized) during depression period

**Attribution breakdown**:
- Primarily driven by **nominal income rising** (real growth component)
- Real GDP recovery was the main deleveraging mechanism
- Currency depreciation initially increased foreign debt burden, then stabilized

#### Deleveraging Dynamics (1998-2004)

**Debt reduction**: Debt/GDP fell **-15%** during reflation period

**Debt-to-income reduction sources**:
- Mostly from **nominal income rising**
- Driven primarily by **higher real growth**
- Lower real FX (bottomed at **-16% during beautiful period**) set up renewed competitiveness

#### Recovery Timeline

- **5 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **23 years** before equity prices (USD terms) recovered to pre-crisis levels
- Depreciated currency created foundation for export competitiveness

#### Political Impact

Crisis helped create conditions for **Thaksin Shinawatra** (populist leader) to take power in 2001

## Indonesia 1994-2012 Case Auto-Summary

**Crisis type**: Transitory **inflationary deleveraging cycle** (1994-2012)
**Key characteristic**: Country "letting its currency go" in face of external pressures — produces temporary inflation but gives policymakers flexibility on interest rates

### The Bubble Phase (1994-1997)

#### Debt Buildup

- Debts reached **104% of GDP** by bubble's end
- **51% of GDP in foreign currencies** — massive FX exposure vulnerability
- Large exposure to foreign capital pullback

#### Capital Flows and Growth

- Investment inflows: Low but positive, averaging **~5% of GDP**
- Current account deficit: **-3% of GDP**
- **Strong growth at 7%** fueled by rising debt and capital
- GDP gap peaked at **13%** (economy running very hot)

#### Asset Returns and Competitiveness Issues

- Equities averaged **12% annualized returns** during bubble
- Strong returns encouraged more borrowing, stimulating growth
- Real FX peaked at **+19%** — competitiveness became major issue
- Unsustainable combination: bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + weakened regional conditions

### The Depression Phase (1997-1998)

#### The Shock: Asian Financial Crisis

High debt levels left Indonesia vulnerable when 1997 crisis hit

#### Capital Flight and Policy Response

- **Capital inflows fell 13% of GDP** — sudden stop in foreign funding
- Policymakers **hiked short rates by 43%** (peak tightening)
- Real FX fell **-110%** — massive currency collapse
- Central bank **spent down reserves by 23%** defending currency before abandoning defense

#### Economic Collapse

- **GDP fell 14%** (self-reinforcing decline)
- **Stock prices fell 89%**
- Currency weakness drove **inflation to 59%** peak during depression
- Normal pattern vs. other cases despite having only **~1/4 of classic "risk factors"** for bigger inflation spirals
  - Biggest risk factor: **high foreign-denominated debts**

#### Financial System Stress

Financial institutions under considerable pressure during crisis

#### Deleveraging Paradox (1997-1998)

Despite needing deleveraging, **debt/GDP rose 132%** (132% annualized)

**Why debt burden increased**:
- Primarily due to **currency collapse** increasing foreign-denominated debt burden
- FX debt became much heavier in local currency terms
- Real growth eventually resumed but couldn't offset initial FX shock

#### Measurement Framework

**Bubble & Depression Gauge**: Compendium of stats measuring bubble/depression conditions
**Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Measures money and credit tightness/easiness
- Difference from zero shows extent of bubble
- Crossing above/below zero = shifting into/out of bubble

### The Reflation Phase (post-1998)

#### Policy Choice and Execution

- Abandoned currency peg after relatively short "ugly" phase
- Allowed tightening to flow through, reducing import spending
- **Current account improved by 4% of GDP**
- Made currency more attractive to hold

#### Aggressive Financial Management

Pulled **7 out of 9 classic policy levers**:
- **Nationalized banks**
- **Provided liquidity**
- **Directly purchased troubled assets**
- Received **IMF assistance program**

#### Deleveraging Success (reflation period)

**Debt/GDP fell 178%** (13% annualized)

**Debt-to-income reduction mechanism**:
- Primarily through **nominal income rising** (real growth dominant)
- Real growth was the main engine of deleveraging
- Currency stabilization helped after initial depreciation shock

## Indonesia 1994–2012 Case Study: Recovery and Deleveraging

### Deleveraging Attribution: Reflation Period (1998-2012)

- **Debt reduction of 13% of GDP** during 1998-2012 reflation period driven by multiple factors:
  - Real growth: primary driver of income rising faster than debt
  - Inflation contribution: nominal income increases
  - Domestic debt changes: modest reduction
  - FX debt changes due to currency movement: significant contributor
  - Other FX debt changes

### Recovery Timeline and Outcomes

- **5 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **13 years** before equity prices in USD terms recovered
- Real FX bottomed at **-90% during beautiful period** (massive currency devaluation)
- Devalued currency set Indonesia up for **renewed competitiveness** post-crisis

## Korea 1994–2001 Case Study

### Overview: Transitory Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- Classic example of **"letting the currency go"** in face of external pressures
- Produces temporary inflation but gives policy makers **more flexibility to set interest rates**
- Crisis period: 1994-2001

### The Bubble Phase (1994-1997)

**Debt Dynamics:**
- Debts rose **23% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **163% of GDP**
- High foreign currency exposure: **27% of GDP** in FX debt — creating vulnerability to capital pullback
- Total debt service reached **42% of GDP** at pre-crisis peak

**Capital Flows and Growth:**
- Capital inflows moderately strong: averaging **~8% of GDP**
- Financed current account deficit of **3% of GDP**
- Strong growth: **8%** real GDP growth
- GDP gap peaked at **5%** (economy running hot)

**Unsustainable Situation:**
- Self-reinforcing cycle: rising debt and capital → strong growth
- Heavy dependence on foreign financing
- Weakened conditions in related Asian countries created vulnerability

### The Depression Phase (1997-1998)

**The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis Shock:**

**Capital and Currency Collapse:**
- Foreign funding dried up: capital inflows fell **9% of GDP**
- Real FX fell to **-50%** (currency halved)
- Central bank spent down reserves **24%** defending currency, then abandoned defense

**Policy Response:**
- Policy makers hiked short rates by **14%** (tightening)
- Allowed meaningful currency decline

**Economic Damage:**
- GDP fell **8%**
- Stock prices fell **75%**
- Home prices fell **13%**
- Unemployment rates increased **6%**
- Currency weakness contributed to moderate inflation: peaked at **7%** (low compared to similar cases)

**Why Low Inflation Despite Currency Collapse:**
- Korea had only ~1/4 of classic "risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals
- Biggest missing risk factor: **low central bank reserves** (already spent down defending currency)

**Financial Sector Pressure:**
- Financial institutions came under considerable pressure
- Debt as % GDP rose **19%** (13% annualized) despite deleveraging need
- Increase due to currency fall raising burden of foreign-denominated debt

**Attribution During Depression (1997-1998):**
- Debt rose 13% annualized driven by:
  - Real growth: negative (contraction)
  - Inflation: moderate contribution
  - Domestic debt changes: contributed to increase
  - **FX debt changes due to currency move: major driver** of debt burden increase

### The Reflation Phase (1998-2001)

**Policy Choice: Currency Devaluation Path:**
- Abandoned currency peg
- After "slightly shorter than average ugly phase," allowed enough tightening to:
  - Reduce spending on imports: current account improved **7% of GDP**
  - Make currency more attractive to hold

**Aggressive Policy Response (7 of 9 classic levers):**
1. **Nationalized banks**
2. **Provided liquidity**
3. **Directly purchased troubled assets**
4. IMF assistance program
5. Structural reforms for labor market flexibility

**Deleveraging Results:**
- Debt as % of GDP fell **25%** (10% annualized) over adjustment period
- Reduction came mostly from **nominal income rising** (higher real growth primarily)
- Real FX bottomed at **-17% during beautiful period** — set up renewed competitiveness

**Recovery Timeline:**
- **1.7 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- **9 years** before equity prices in USD terms recovered

### Korea Case Gauges and Metrics

**Bubble & Depression Gauge:**
- Bubble peaked ~1997
- Sharp drop into depression phase
- Gradual recovery into reflation phase through 2007

**Tightening & Easing Gauge:**
- Peak tightening occurred during 1997-1998 crisis
- Followed by sustained easing period post-1998

**Core Inflation:**
- Spike to ~8% during crisis (1997-1998)
- Gradual decline to 2-3% range during reflation

**Key Lesson:**
> "A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow a tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary)."

## Malaysia 1994–2001 Case Auto-Summary

### Overview: Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- **Malaysia 1994-2001**: Classic example of **transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle**
- Pattern: "letting currency go" in face of external pressures
- Produced temporary inflation but gave policymakers **more flexibility to set interest rates**
- Three distinct phases: Bubble → Depression → Reflation

### The Bubble Phase (1994-1997)

#### Debt Accumulation Dynamics

- **Debt rose 53% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **212% of GDP**
- Major vulnerability: **39% of GDP was foreign currency debt** — large exposure to capital flight
- Self-reinforcing cycle: unsustainably strong capital inflows + rising debt + strong growth
- **Capital inflows averaged ~6% of GDP**, financing **8% of GDP current account deficit**
- Growth strong at **10%** while economic activity levels high (**GDP gap peaked at 9%**)

#### The Unsustainable Situation

- Bubble pressures + dependence on foreign financing + weakening in related countries
- Created fundamentally **unsustainable situation**

### The Depression Phase (1997-1998)

#### The Trigger: 1997 Asian Financial Crisis

- **Capital inflows fell 5% of GDP** — sudden stop in foreign funding
- Policymakers responded with **4% short rate hike**, causing tightening
- **Currency (real FX) fell 24%**
- **GDP fell 9%**, **stock prices fell 83%**

#### Inflation and Risk Factors

- Currency weakness → inflation peaked at **5% during depression**
- Relatively **low inflation** compared to similar cases

  - Biggest risk factor: **current account deficit**

#### Financial System Stress

- Financial institutions under **considerable pressure**
- Central bank **spent down reserves 27%** to defend currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**

#### Debt Service Crisis

- Pre-crisis debt service reached **45% of GDP** — made Malaysia vulnerable to shock
- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt/GDP rose 10% (7% annualized)** during depression
- Increase partly due to **currency fall** (increased burden of foreign-denominated debt)

### The Reflation Phase (1998-2001)

#### Policy Response: Currency Abandonment

- Key decision: How to respond to adverse capital flows?
  - Option 1: Let currency go + allow tightening (painful but typically necessary)
  - Option 2: Print money to make up for money leaving (inflationary)
- Malaysia chose: **Abandoned currency peg**
- After slightly shorter than average "ugly" phase, allowed enough tightening to flow through

#### Current Account Adjustment

- **Current account balance improved 19% of GDP**
- Made currency **more attractive to hold**

#### Aggressive Financial System Management

- Malaysia pulled **7 out of 9 classic policy levers**
- **Nationalized banks**
- **Provided liquidity**
- **Directly purchased troubled assets**

#### Deleveraging Results

- **Debt/GDP fell 41% (18% annualized)** over adjustment period
- Reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from **nominal income rising**, driven primarily by **higher real growth**
- **Real FX bottomed at -9%** during beautiful period — set up country for renewed competitiveness

#### Recovery Timeline

- Took **2 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Equity prices in USD terms recovered within **14 years**

- Investment inflows averaged **12% of GDP**, financing a current account deficit of **5% of GDP**

#### Economic Performance

- Growth strong at **5%** with moderate economic activity (GDP gap peaked at **2%**)
- Equity returns averaged **8% annualized** over bubble period, encouraging more borrowing
- Competitiveness became an issue: real FX peaked at **+23%**

## Russia 1996–2006 Case Auto-Summary

### Overview: Transitory Inflationary Deleveraging

- Russia experienced a **transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1996-2006
- Classic example of "letting its currency go" in the face of external pressures
- Produced temporary inflation but gave policymakers more flexibility to set interest rates

### The Bubble Phase

#### Debt Accumulation Without Broad-Based Bubble

- Built substantial debt stock driven by **unsustainably strong capital inflows**
- Total debt reached **112% of GDP** prior to crisis
- **38% of GDP in foreign currencies**—creating large exposure to foreign capital pullback
- Became dependent on continuous foreign financing: investment inflows averaged **5% of GDP** in pre-crisis years
- High debts + dependence on foreign financing + weakened conditions in related countries = unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (1997-1998)

#### Triggers and Contagion

- **Balance of payments/currency crisis** ran from 1997-1998
- Pre-crisis peak: debt service reached **90% of GDP**—making Russia vulnerable to shock

## Colombia 1995–2008 Case Study

### Overview: Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- Colombia experienced a **transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1995 and 2008

- **Debt rose 11% of GDP** during bubble to pre-crisis peak of **58% of GDP**
- **30% of GDP was foreign-currency denominated** — creating major vulnerability to capital flight
- Investment inflows averaged **8% of GDP**, financing current account deficit of **5% of GDP**

#### Economic Indicators

- Growth strong at **3%** with GDP gap peaking at **5%**
- Competitiveness deteriorated: real FX peaked at **+16%**

  - Government had to borrow more in response (peak fiscal deficit **5% of GDP**)

### The Reflation Phase (2003-2008)

#### Policy Choice: Let the Currency Go

- Colombia **abandoned the currency peg**
- After slightly longer than average "ugly" phase, allowed enough tightening to flow through

#### Deleveraging Mechanics

- Current account balance improved **5% of GDP** via reduced import spending
- Made currency more attractive to hold
- Debt as % of GDP fell **16% (3% annualized)** over adjustment period

## Ecuador 1995-2009 Case Study

### Overview: Classic Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- Ecuador experienced an **inflationary deleveraging cycle** between 1995-2009
- Unlike many debt crises, Ecuador had no domestic bubble before the crisis
- Instead, was tied to other bubble economies and financial markets experiencing bubble conditions
- Built substantial debt stock: **85% of GDP** pre-crisis
- **56% of GDP in foreign currency debt** — massive exposure to capital flight risk
- Running **4% of GDP current account deficit**, with investment inflows averaging 3% of GDP pre-crisis
- High debt + foreign financing dependence + contagion from other countries = unsustainable situation

### The Bubble Phase

- No broad domestic bubble, but connected to bubble economies elsewhere
- Total debt reached 85% of GDP
- Foreign currency debt: 56% of GDP (extremely high)
- Current account deficit: 4% of GDP

- Recovered strongly, reaching ~350 by 2008-2009
- **Nominal rates**: short rates fell from 60% to near 5%
- Long rates tracked similar path
- **Real FX vs TWI**: fell from +20% to approximately **-50%**
- Partial recovery but remained depressed

#### External Position
- **Reserves**: relatively flat pre-crisis, plunged during crisis
- Recovered strongly from 2003, rising from index 100 to 350+
- **Capital inflows**: peaked near 10% of GDP pre-crisis
- Plunged to **-20% of GDP** during crisis (massive outflow)
- Stabilized around 3-5% of GDP post-crisis

### Political Impact

- Crisis helped set stage for **Lucio Gutierrez** to take power in 2003
- Many consider Gutierrez a **populist leader**
- Political shift was direct consequence of economic crisis pain

### Key Lessons

- **Foreign currency debt exposure** creates severe vulnerability in crisis
- Currency collapse increases debt burden even as economy needs deleveraging
- Abandoning unsustainable currency defense can be necessary despite short-term pain
- **Aggressive policy response** using all available levers can work
- Allowing currency to depreciate substantially can restore competitiveness
- Inflation can be tool for deleveraging, though painful
- Political consequences of crises can be profound and lasting

## Turkey 1997–2003 Case Study

### Overview: Classic Inflationary Deleveraging Cycle

- **Turkey** experienced classic inflationary deleveraging between 1997-2003
- Driven by self-reinforcing cycles of debt, equity returns, and growth

### The Bubble Phase (1997-2000)

#### Debt Dynamics
- Debts rose **17% of GDP** during bubble, reaching pre-crisis peak of **60% of GDP**
- **46% of GDP** in foreign currency debt — massive FX exposure vulnerability
- High debt service burden: peaked at **30% of GDP** pre-crisis

#### Capital Flows and Growth
- Investment inflows low but positive: ~**3% of GDP**
- Growth moderate at **2%** annually
- GDP gap peaked at **9%** (high economic activity levels)
- Strong equity returns: **22% annualized** over bubble period encouraged borrowing

#### Currency and Competitiveness
- Foreign financing dependence created unsustainable situation
- Bubble dynamics combined with FX exposure set up crisis

### The Depression Phase (2000-2001)

#### The Trigger
- Political turmoil and violence served as shock
- High debt service (**30% of GDP**) left Turkey extremely vulnerable

#### Capital Flight and Currency Collapse
- Capital inflows fell **10% of GDP**
- Policymakers hiked short rates **157%** in response
- Real FX fell **12%** (currency devaluation)
- Central bank spent down reserves **100%** defending currency before abandoning peg

#### Economic Contraction
- GDP fell **10%**
- Stock prices crashed **78%**
- Unemployment rose **3%**

#### Inflation Spiral
- Inflation peaked at **62%** during depression — high vs other cases
- Currency weakness drove rising inflation
- Turkey had classic "risk factors" for inflation spirals, especially **long history of poorly-controlled inflation**

#### Debt Paradox During Deleveraging
- Despite needing to deleverage, debt/GDP **rose 9%** (6% annualized)
- Two key drivers:
  1. Currency fell, increasing burden of foreign-denominated debts
  2. Government borrowed more in crisis response (fiscal deficit peaked at **11% of GDP**)

#### Financial System Stress
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- Government response: nationalized banks, provided liquidity, directly purchased troubled assets

### The Reflation Phase (2001-2003)

#### Policy Response Choice
- Key determinant: how policymakers respond to adverse capital flows
- Options: (1) let currency fall and allow tightening (painful but necessary), or (2) print money to compensate (inflationary)
- Turkey **abandoned currency peg** after "ugly" phase
- Allowed enough tightening to reduce import spending

#### Policy Levers Deployed
- Turkey pulled **7 out of 9 classic policy levers** — very aggressive
- **Nationalized banks**
- **Provided liquidity**
- **Directly purchased troubled assets**
- **IMF assistance program**
- **Structural reforms** for labor market flexibility

#### Current Account Adjustment
- Current account improved **5% of GDP**
- Made currency more attractive to hold

#### Deleveraging Mechanics
- Debt/GDP fell **6%** (3% annualized) over adjustment period
- Reduction came mostly from **nominal income rising**, not actual debt paydown
- Real FX bottomed at **-18%** during "beautiful period"
- Set up renewed competitiveness

#### Recovery Timeline
- **2 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Equity prices in USD terms recovered within **6 years**

## Argentina 1998–2012 Case Study

### Overview: Transitory Inflationary Deleveraging

- **Argentina** experienced transitory inflationary deleveraging 1998-2012
- Classic example of **"letting currency go"** in face of external pressures
- Produces temporary inflation but gives policymakers more flexibility on interest rates

### The Bubble Phase (1998-2001)

- Competitiveness became major issue
- Unsustainable situation: bubble pressures + foreign financing dependence + weakened conditions in related countries

### The Depression Phase (2001-2002)

#### High Debt Vulnerability
- High debt levels left Argentina vulnerable to shock
- Shock materialized (specifics not detailed in this section)


<!-- pp. 1361-1380 -->

## Argentina 1998-2012: Depression Phase

### Contagion from Late 1990s EM Crises

- **Argentina** experienced ripple effects from late 1990s crises in other emerging markets
- **Capital inflows fell by 10% of GDP**, triggering severe external pressure
- Policy makers responded with aggressive tightening: **short rates hiked 173%**
- **Currency collapsed**: real FX fell 77%
- **GDP contracted 15%**, stock prices fell 82%
- Unemployment increased 3%
- Currency weakness drove **inflation to 32%** during depression—normal for this type of crisis given Argentina's history of poorly-controlled inflation

### Risk Factors for Inflation

- Biggest risk factor: **long history of poorly-controlled inflation**
- Financial institutions under considerable pressure during crisis
- Central bank **depleted reserves by 66%** defending the currency before abandoning the peg

### Debt Dynamics in Depression

- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt-to-GDP rose 118% (62% annualized)**
- Two drivers of debt increase:
  1. **Currency depreciation** increased burden of foreign-denominated debts
  2. Government borrowed more to respond to crisis (peak **fiscal deficit of 4% of GDP**)
- Deleveraging attribution chart shows these components visually

### The Reflation Phase

#### Policy Choices: Currency vs. Printing

- Key determinant of balance of payments/currency crises: how policy makers respond to adverse capital flows
- Two options:
  1. Let currency depreciate and allow financial tightening (painful but typically necessary)
  2. Print money to compensate for capital outflows (can be inflationary)
- **Argentina abandoned currency peg** after shorter-than-average "ugly" phase
- Allowed sufficient tightening to:
  - Reduce import spending
  - **Improve current account by 7% of GDP**
  - Make currency more attractive to hold

#### Aggressive Policy Response

- Argentina **very aggressive in managing financial institutions and bad debts**
- Used **6 out of 9 classic policy levers**:
  - **Nationalized banks**
  - Provided liquidity
  - IMF assistance program
  - Structural reforms for labor market flexibility

#### Deleveraging Success

- Over adjustment period, **debt-to-GDP fell 140% (15% annualized)**
- Reduction came mostly from **nominal income rising**
- **Real FX bottomed at -42%** during the "beautiful period" (post-depression recovery)
- Devalued currency set up Argentina for **renewed competitiveness**

#### Recovery Timeline

- **5 years** before real GDP reached prior peak
- Equity prices (in USD terms) recovered within **7 years**

#### Political Impact

- Crisis helped **Eduardo Duhalde** (populist leader) take power

## Iceland 2005-2016: Inflationary Deleveraging Case

### Overview

- **Transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle** between 2005 and 2016
- Classic example of a country **"letting its currency go"** in face of external pressures
- Produces temporary inflation but gives policy makers **more flexibility to set interest rates**

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

#### Core Dynamics

- Self-reinforcing cycle of:
  - Unsustainably strong capital inflows
  - Rising debt
  - Strong equity returns
  - Strong housing returns

#### Debt Accumulation

- **Debts rose 565% of GDP** during bubble phase
- Pre-crisis peak: **1173% of GDP**
- High share in foreign currencies: **691% of GDP**
- Left Iceland with **large exposure to pullback in foreign capital**

#### Financing and Growth

- Investment inflows averaged **37% of GDP**
- Financed **current account deficit of 18% of GDP**
- Combined with rising debt and capital, growth was strong at **7%**
- **Equities averaged 12% annualized returns** over bubble period
- Strong asset returns encouraged more borrowing and stimulated growth

#### Unsustainable Situation

- Bubble pressures + dependence on foreign financing + weakened conditions in related countries = unsustainable
- Iceland particularly vulnerable due to foreign financing dependence

### The Depression Phase (2008-2010)

#### Crisis Trigger

- High debt levels left Iceland vulnerable to shock
- Shock came via **2008 global financial crisis**

#### Capital Flight and Policy Response

- **Capital inflows fell 49% of GDP**
- Policy makers **hiked short rates by 4%** (tightening)
- **Real FX fell 29%**—meaningful currency decline

#### Economic Collapse

- **GDP fell 11%**
- **Stock prices fell 96%**
- **Home prices fell 15%**
- **Unemployment increased 5%**

#### Moderate Inflation

- Currency weakness contributed to moderate inflation
- Peaked at **18% during depression phase**
- **Low compared to other similar cases**
- Makes sense: Iceland had only **~quarter of classic "risk factors"** for bigger inflation spirals
- Biggest risk factor: **high foreign-denominated debts**

#### Financial Sector Stress

- Financial institutions under considerable pressure
- Central bank **drew down reserves by 18%** defending currency
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense**

#### Debt Dynamics

- Despite needing deleveraging, **debt-to-GDP rose 122% (46% annualized)**
- Two causes:
  1. Currency depreciation increased burden of foreign-denominated debts
  2. Government borrowed more in response (peak **fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP**)

### Measurement Notes

- Gauges shown are composite measures from comprehensive chart deck
- First two charts: measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money/credit
- For each gauge, difference from zero = extent of bubble
- Crossing above/below zero = shifting into/out of bubble phase

<!-- pp. 1381-1400 -->

## Iceland 2005-2016: Reflation Phase (continued)

### Policy Response to Capital Flight

- **Critical policy choice**: Whether to allow financial tightening (painful but necessary) or print money to compensate for capital outflows (inflationary)
- **Iceland's approach**: After longer-than-average "ugly" phase, allowed sufficient tightening to:
  - Reduce import spending (current account improved 13% of GDP)
  - Make currency more attractive to hold
- **Aggressive financial management**: Pulled 6 of 9 classic policy levers
  - Nationalized banks
  - Provided liquidity
  - Received IMF assistance program

### Deleveraging Results (2010-2016)

- **Debt reduction**: Fell 1,037% (170% annualized) as % of GDP
- **Composition of deleveraging**:
  - Balanced mix of outright debt reduction
  - Rising income (primarily higher real growth)
- **Currency devaluation impact**: Real FX bottomed at -22% during beautiful period, creating renewed competitiveness
- **Recovery timeline**: 8 years before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Incomplete recovery**: Equity prices in USD terms haven't fully recovered

## Russia 2005-2011 Case Study

### The Bubble Phase (2005-2008)

**Classic inflationary deleveraging** — example of "letting its currency go" under external pressure, producing temporary inflation but giving policymakers flexibility to set interest rates

#### Bubble Dynamics

- **Self-reinforcing cycle**: Strong capital inflows → rising debt → strong growth → strong asset returns
- **Peak debt levels**: 66% of GDP, with high FX exposure (21% of GDP in foreign currencies)
- **Vulnerability**: Large exposure to pullback in foreign capital
- **Investment inflows**: Averaged ~10% of GDP
- **Growth**: Strong at 8% annually
- **GDP gap**: Peaked at 8% (high economic activity levels)
- **Asset returns**: Equities averaged 46% annualized returns
- **Unsustainable combination**: Bubble pressures + dependence on foreign financing + weakened conditions in related countries

### The Depression Phase (2008-2009)

**Self-reinforcing bust** triggered by 2008 global financial crisis and oil price collapse

#### Crisis Impact

- **Foreign funding collapse**: Capital inflows fell 21% of GDP
- **Policy tightening**: Short rates hiked 19%
- **Currency crash**: Real FX fell 21%
- **GDP contraction**: Fell 8%
- **Stock market collapse**: Down 71%
- **Unemployment**: Rose 3%
- **Inflation**: Peaked at 15% during depression (moderate vs. similar cases)
  - **Why relatively low**: Russia had only ~25% of classic "risk factors" for bigger inflation spirals
  - Biggest missing factor: No long history of poorly-controlled inflation
- **Financial institutions**: Came under considerable pressure
- **Reserve drawdown**: Central bank spent down reserves 44% to defend currency, then abandoned defense

#### Deleveraging Attribution (Depression Period)

- **Debt as % GDP rose 17%** (12% annualized) despite needing deleveraging
- **Reason**: Currency depreciation increased burden of foreign-denominated debt
- **Charts show**: Rough gauges composed from compendium of stats
  - Bubble/depression gauge: Distance from zero = extent of bubble; crossing zero = shift into/out of bubble
  - Tightening/easing gauge: Measures money/credit conditions

### The Reflation Phase (2009-2011)

**Key policy choice**: Allow tightening (painful but necessary) vs. print money to replace outflows (inflationary)

#### Russia's Response

- **Shorter "ugly" phase** than average
- **Allowed sufficient tightening** to make currency attractive to hold
- **Aggressive management**: Pulled 4 of 9 classic policy levers
- **Debt reduction**: Fell 14% (8% annualized) as % of GDP
- **Source of reduction**: Mostly from nominal income rising (not outright debt paydown)
- **Currency impact**: Real FX bottomed at 11% during beautiful period, setting up renewed competitiveness
- **Recovery timeline**: 3 years before real GDP reached prior peak
- **Incomplete recovery**: Equity prices in USD terms haven't fully recovered

## Russia 2012–2016 Case Study: Inflationary Deleveraging

### Overview: A Textbook Inflationary Deleveraging

- **Russia 2012-2016** represents a **transitory inflationary deleveraging cycle**
- Classic example of "letting its currency go" in response to external pressures
- Currency depreciation produces temporary inflation but gives policymakers more flexibility on interest rates
- Unlike many cases, Russia lacked a broad-based bubble pre-crisis but built substantial debt

### The Bubble Phase (Pre-2014)

#### Debt Accumulation Without Typical Bubble

- No broad-based bubble, but **substantial debt buildup driven by unsustainably strong capital inflows**
- Debt rose **19% of GDP** to pre-crisis peak of **89% of GDP** during leveraging phase
- **15% of GDP in foreign currency debt** — created major vulnerability to capital flight
- Average capital inflows of **6% of GDP** in years before crisis
- Created dependence on continuous foreign financing — an unsustainable situation

### The Depression Phase (2014-2016)

#### Trigger and Mechanisms

- **Oil price collapse** was the external shock that exposed vulnerabilities
- Pre-crisis debt service burden: **32% of GDP** — made Russia highly vulnerable
- Capital inflows reversed dramatically: **fell by 8% of GDP**
- Policymakers responded by **hiking short rates by 7%**
- **Real FX fell 30%** — severe currency depreciation
- **GDP declined 4%**, stocks fell 46%

#### Inflation Dynamics

- Currency weakness contributed to **moderate inflation peaking at 18%** during depression
- Relatively low compared to similar cases because Russia had **only ~25% of classic "risk factors" for inflation spirals**
- Biggest missing risk factor: **no long history of poorly-controlled inflation**
- Contrast with countries prone to hyperinflation

#### Central Bank Response

- Initially **defended currency by drawing down reserves 26%**
- Eventually **abandoned currency defense** — let ruble fall
- This was the critical policy choice that defined the deleveraging path

#### Debt Dynamics During Depression

- **Debt/GDP rose 19% (9% annualized)** despite need for deleveraging
- Two drivers of increase:
  1. **Currency fall** increased burden of foreign-denominated debt
  2. **Government borrowing** to respond to crisis (peak fiscal deficit: **4% of GDP**)
- Financial institutions came under considerable pressure

#### Composite Gauges Summary

- **Bubble & Depression Gauge**: Shows clear bubble peak followed by sharp depression
- **Tightening & Easing Gauge**: Peak tightening during crisis before eventual easing
- **Core Inflation**: Spiked to 18% during depression phase

### The Reflation Phase (2016+)

#### Policy Response

- After "ugly phase," policymakers **allowed sufficient tightening to stabilize currency**
- Made ruble more attractive to hold
- **Aggressive management of financial institutions and bad debts**
- Pulled **4 out of 9 classic policy levers**

#### Deleveraging Mechanics

- **Debt/GDP fell 7% (14% annualized)** during reflation period
- Reduction came from **balanced mix**:
  - Outright debt reduction
  - Rising income (nominal GDP growth)
- **Real FX bottomed at -17%** during reflation — created **renewed competitiveness**

#### Recovery Status

- Real GDP **has not yet reached prior peak**
- Equity prices in USD terms **haven't fully recovered**
- Demonstrates painful but necessary adjustment process

### Key Policy Lessons

#### The Central Choice in Currency Crises

- Critical decision: How to respond to adverse capital flows
- Two options:
  1. **Allow tightening** to flow through (painful but resolves crisis)
  2. **Print money** to replace outflows (inflationary)
- Russia chose option 1 after initially trying to defend the currency

#### Why the Approach Worked

- Shorter-than-average "ugly phase" because policymakers allowed sufficient tightening
- Currency stabilization made assets more attractive
- Aggressive financial sector cleanup prevented zombie institutions
- Lower currency improved export competitiveness

### Data Visualizations Context

## Appendix: Macroprudential Policies

### Definition and Purpose

- **Macroprudential policies** = tools for directing credit through central bank's regulatory authorities
- Distinct from monetary policy: monetary policy makes credit broadly available without choosing winners; fiscal policy apportions it; macroprudential sits between
- Need arises from credit differentiation: bubbles in one area, starvation in another
- Classic countercyclical approach: easier credit standards during busts (lower down payments in housing bust), harder standards during bubbles

### Historical Context and Usage

- **Not a new tool** — used throughout modern monetary policy history
- Federal Reserve changed margin requirements for equity holdings **23 times** since formation
  - Pattern: tightened during rallies/excess stock market credit, eased during bear markets/depressed volumes
- **1990s-mid-2000s = historical exception** when macroprudential tools became rare
- Post-crisis: global return to macroprudential tools as key management instrument

### When Macroprudential Policies Are Deployed

**Used when interest rate policy loses effectiveness:**
- Economy needs stimulation but rates already at zero
- Tightening needed in specific areas but overall rate hikes would drag growth

**Used to redirect credit strategically:**
- From credit-starved sectors
- Away from frothy assets/lending

**Resemblance to fiscal policy:**
- Can benefit some at expense of others (generally avoided)
- Useful during deleveraging to manage differentiated conditions

### QE and Macroprudential Interaction

- **QE often fuels pockets of frothiness** in asset markets while broader economy still recovering
- Great Depression and WWII examples: central banks used macroprudential measures to reduce froth pockets while keeping overall monetary policy easy

### Policy Tools Taxonomy

**Demand-side measures (changing demand for credit):**
- Loan-to-value ratios
- Debt service-to-income ratios
- Loan maturity requirements
- Margin requirements for financial assets
- Cost of loans via interest rate subsidies/tax policy/regulations

**Supply-side measures (changing supply of credit):**
- Capital/reserve requirements for certain lending types
- Portfolio restrictions on assets financial institutions can hold
- Accounting rules on different assets
- Supervisor pressure for certain lending behaviors
- Interest/lending rate ceilings and limitations

### Coordination Requirements

- **Most successful cases** = Federal Reserve, Congress, executive branch, regulatory bodies coordinated
- Lawmakers and executive branch armed government bodies (including Fed) with tools and authority
- New institutions created to implement and monitor regulations
- **Example: WWII effort** — Congress revised laws to give Fed needed authority, Roosevelt used executive orders to supplement

### Implementation Success Factors

**Mixed track record — what worked:**
- Effective policies used for long periods or expanded; unsuccessful ones ended within months
- **Significant experimentation and flexibility** critical to success
- Financial system evolution → changing toolset as cost/benefit trade-offs shifted
- Financial innovations enabled circumvention → policies adapted or abandoned

**What didn't work:**
- Policies with bad second-order consequences continued too long
- **Regulation Q example**: caps on deposit interest rates helped smaller banks initially (1930s), but by 1950s created distortions driving deposits into shadow banking
- **S&L deregulation (early 1980s)**: meant to help institutions cope with tight monetary policy, contributed to S&L crisis beginning mid-1980s

### Key Questions for Policy Makers

**1. Where are bubbles emerging? How confident are you they are bubbles?**
- **1935-36 tightening example**: responded to rapid stock appreciation, feared bubble, but tightening was excessive for deleveraging economy → severe recession, stocks fell 60% (1937-1938)
- **"Mopping up" approach (recent decades)**: avoid pricking bubbles, deal with aftermath instead
  - Rationale: difficulty knowing when market is mispricing
  - Example: despite housing market concerns, regulators didn't aggressively target frothy mortgage lending in 2006

**2. Which sectors are credit-starved? Need for differentiated policy?**
- **1950s framework** — four tests developed:
  - How effective is general monetary policy in balancing credit provision?
  - How potentially destabilizing is credit growth in the specific sector?
  - How important is credit to the sector's growth?
  - How effective would selective credit controls be?

**3. Political costs of picking winners/losers?**

**4. Which policy tools — demand vs. supply, or both?**

**5. How to measure effectiveness?**

**6. Second- and third-order consequences? How to handle them?**
- Often emerge years later
- Flexibility crucial for adaptation

**7. Policy coordination — legislators, executive, central bank?**
- **Most successful US cases** = broad government coordination
- **WWII example**: Congress + Roosevelt executive orders gave Fed authority
- **Volcker era**: policy makers given flexibility to shift nimbly as circumstances changed
- Biggest failures from low flexibility (interest rate caps not flexibly adapted → negative consequences)
- **Current structural differences**: UK vested power in BoE and Financial Policy Committee (FPC); US uses multiple agencies coordinated through Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) post-crisis

## Historical Cases: Margin Requirements

### Mechanism
- **Margin requirement** = collateral (often cash) investors must provide to buy investment using credit
- Increasing requirement → downward pressure on credit for financial asset purchases

### Post-1934 Usage Pattern
- Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gave Fed ability to set margin requirements
- **Used counter-cyclically**: increase when asset prices booming and credit for purchases rising; decrease in opposite situation
- **Regulation T** = margin requirements for brokers
- **Regulation U** = margin requirement for banks

### Decline After 1974
- Federal Reserve mostly stopped using this lever post-1974
- Derivatives and other credit-based asset purchase methods made it easy to sidestep

## Historical Cases: Underwriting Standards

### Great Depression Era

**Federal Home Loan Bank System (1932):**
- Quasi-central bank for S&Ls
- Provided liquidity via advances or collateralized lending
- Set underwriting standards and collateral restrictions

**Federal Housing Administration (1934):**
- Insured home loans
- **Easier standards**: 80% loan-to-value, 20-year maturity for eligible loans

**Electric Home and Farm Authority (1934):**
- Cheap loans for home electric appliances
- <10% interest rate, 5% down payment, up to 36 months
- Ended 1942

**1935 National Bank Changes:**
- Lowered loan-to-value from 50% to 60%
- Extended maturity restrictions from up to 5 years to 10 years

**1934-1937 FHA Property Improvement Insurance:**
- Insured up to 20% of loans (up to 5-year maturity) for improving residential properties

**1938 FHA Home Loan Expansion:**
- 90% loan-to-value, 25-year maturity now eligible

### World War II

**Roosevelt Executive Order (1941):**
- Limited installment credit for consumer durable goods purchases
- Goal: direct production toward national defense vs. domestic consumption
- Quote: "liberal terms for such credit tend to stimulate demand for consumers' durable goods, the production of which requires the materials, skills, and equipment needed for national defense"

**Regulation W:**
- Federal Reserve enforced tighter underwriting on all consumer installment loans

### Postwar Period

**Regulation X (October 1950):**
- Worried about rising mortgage debt, aimed to tighten housing credit
- Loan-to-value and maturity caps on residential real estate loans, increasingly restrictive as loan size grew
- **Target**: reduce 1951 housing production by one-third of 1950 levels

**1950 FHA/VA Tightening (Truman's request):**
- Raised down payment requirement 5%
- Decreased maximum FHA loan on single-family homes from $16,000 to $14,000
- Maximum maturity of 25 years
- **First restrictive actions** in FHA/VA's nearly 20-year history

**Reversal (mid-1953 recession + political pressure):**
- Measures removed
- August 1954: Congress reversed FHA/VA actions, reducing down payment requirements and raising maximum FHA loan

**Late-1954 Frothy Housing Market:**
- Fed didn't want to tighten (economy just recovering from recession)
- **Multi-pronged macroprudential approach instead**:
  1. FHA/VA raised down payments, reduced maximum maturities from 30 to 25 years (tweaked and eventually reversed in subsequent years)
  2. Field offices instructed to "intensify surveys of local housing markets, and take coordinated steps to restrain federal underwriting of mortgages in localities where housing surpluses were found"
  3. Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) asked Federal Home Loan banks to curb loan commitments to thrifts; September 1954 implemented official restraints on S&L bank lending
  4. Federal Reserve Bank of New York restrained mortgage warehouse lending (commercial banks extending interim loans to finance mortgage origination by nonbank lenders) — **more than doubled** August 1954-August 1955

**Credit Control Act (1969):**
- Gave Federal Reserve ability to use credit controls targeting certain sectors
- Kept overall monetary policy easy while tightening inflationary sectors
- Levers: "maximum rate of interest, maximum maturity, minimum periodic payment, maximum period between payments, and other specification or limitation of the terms and conditions of any extension of credit"
- **Not used until Volcker era**

**1982 Deregulation:**
- Congress abolished loan-to-value ratio and maturity restrictions for national banks

## Historical Cases: Voluntary Guidelines

### Purpose
- Policy makers imposed voluntary restraints/guidelines on banks
- Goal: curb lending for speculative or non-productive ends

**1947 Congressional Encouragement:**
- Banks encouraged to "restrict voluntarily their lending and investing programs"
- Implemented after Fed's consumer installment loan limits expired

**Defense Production Act of 1950 (Korean War):**
- Gave Federal Reserve authority to establish "voluntary" credit restraints

<!-- pp. 1441-1452 -->

## Historical Macroprudential Measures (Continued)

### Voluntary Credit Restraint Programs

- **1965 Balance of Payments Committee**: Recommended "voluntary" lending restraints monitored by Federal Reserve
  - Goal: Reduce net capital outflows by over 15% from previous year
  - Set initial 5% ceiling on foreign loan growth—first quantitative credit target
  - **1968**: President Johnson passed Executive Order allowing Fed to make program mandatory, but Fed declined citing high voluntary participation
  - Programs continued until 1974

- **1966**: Fed prompted banks to slow business loans during high credit creation and rising inflation
  - Non-cooperating banks had their discount window access limited
  - Policy ended after economy slowed

- **Carter's Special Credit Restraint Program (March-July 1980)**
  - Banks, bank holding companies, finance companies, and foreign branches asked to limit loan growth to 6-9%
  - Targeted speculative/inflationary lending while protecting small businesses, farmers, homebuyers
  - Banks encouraged to treat credit for automobiles, home mortgages, and home improvements "normally"
  - Restraints on credit cards, unsecured consumer loans, and "speculative" uses: inventory buildup beyond needs, takeovers/mergers that could be postponed, commodity/precious metals speculation
  - Required periodic reports on lending activities

- **European parallels**: National credit councils in France and Italy announced which sectors needed more credit or were over-burdened, especially post-war

### Reserve Requirements as Macroprudential Tools

**Origins and Evolution**

- **1800s**: State governments instituted first reserve requirements to ensure state-chartered banks had enough reserves (gold/specie) for bank notes and deposit withdrawals
- **National Bank Act (1863)**: Introduced first nationwide reserve requirements
- **Federal Reserve Act of 1913**: Congress eased requirements, viewing them as less critical with Fed as lender of last resort

**Active Counter-Cyclical Use**

- **1930s onward**: Reserve requirements became useful counter-cyclical tool
- **1935**: Congress gave Fed authority to set reserve requirements
- **1938**: Fed lowered reserve requirements in conjunction with Roosevelt's recovery program
- **1940s adjustments**:
  - 1942: Requirements eased three times
  - During war: Fed held requirements steady
  - 1948: Requirements tightened three times back to statutory caps
  - 1949-1951: Adjusted nine times (eased 1949, tightened 1951)
- **Tightening periods**: Fed raised reserve requirements during 1966-69, 1973, and 1979-80

**Loopholes and Evasion**

- New funding instruments emerged to bypass requirements: commercial paper, eurodollars, repurchase agreements, large-denomination CDs
- **1969 Fed response**: Addressed loopholes
  - Capped bank borrowing from overseas branches at 10% (to stop Eurodollar borrowing)
  - Set 10% limit on asset sales to overseas branches
  - **1970**: Limits increased to 20%
  - **1973**: Both lowered to 8% (matching large-denomination CD requirements)

**Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB)**

- **Late 1960s**: Used reserve requirements to affect mortgage lending
  - Reduced requirements when savings declined (increasing liquidity)
  - Raised requirements when lending was high or liquidity abundant

**Volcker's Anti-Inflation Measures**

- **October 1979**: Fed increased rates and reserve requirements to combat inflation
  - Reserve requirements on wholesale liabilities rose to 8% (included time deposits, Eurodollar borrowings, repos with government/agency collateral, federal funds borrowings)
  - **March 1980**: Requirements increased to 10%
  - **April 1980**: Lowered to 5%, then eliminated entirely in July

**1980 Asset-Based Reserve Requirements**

- Fed imposed unprecedented asset-based reserve requirements under 1969 Credit Control Act
  - All lenders required to hold 15% special deposit on specific consumer credit types
  - Money market funds subject to same requirements
  - Both later lowered to 7.5%
  - Money market funds required to file monthly reports
- **August 1980**: Fed removed all restrictions
- **End of 1980**: Congress terminated Credit Control Act

**Later Adjustments**

- **1990 and 1992**: Fed lowered reserve requirements to promote credit availability
- **1968-69 and 1973-74**: FHLBB eased requirements when mortgage lending liquidity was squeezed, with "at most a limited, positive impact"

**European Approaches**

- France and Italy used differentiated reserve requirements to direct credit—e.g., giving public banks more lenient requirements or excluding long-term/export loans
- Regulators often capped loan amounts or central bank financing access for lending—similar downward pressure on credit supply
  - France had "rediscount ceiling" until 1972: cap on borrowing from central bank
  - Caps often differed by sector or loan type to encourage/discourage certain lending
  - Example: Banque de France set lending quotas in agricultural sectors facing overproduction
  - Sometimes caps targeted all lending to corporations or households

### Interest Rate Ceilings as Macroprudential Tools

**Early State Programs**

- **Early 1900s**: States limited deposit interest rates as part of deposit insurance programs

**Federal Reserve Interest Rate Controls**

- **1927 Federal Reserve Act Amendment**: Cap placed on interest paid by national banks to state banks
- **Banking Act of 1933**: Fed could regulate maximum interest rates on time and savings deposits
  - **November 1933**: Regulation Q imposed 3% ceiling
  - After market rates declined, Fed lowered to 2.5% to reduce bank costs
  - Regulation Q allowed Fed to set maximum FDIC rates to non-member insured banks
  - Fed later raised maximum back to 3% (for savings/time deposits with 6+ month maturities) to allow banks to attract depositors
  - **1960-1961**: Fed raised Regulation Q ceilings as market rates rose

**Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) Dividend Ceilings**

- **1934-1989**: FHLBB supervised savings and loans
  - Set informal ceilings on dividends paid by S&Ls, generally 25-50 basis points above Fed funds rate

**Interest Rate Regulation Act of 1966**

- FDIC and FHLBB could set interest rate ceilings on deposits at mutual savings banks and S&Ls
- Fed could set rates for specific deposit classes
  - Set 5.5% limit on single-maturity CDs
  - Lowered maximum interest rates on time deposits
  - **1973**: CD ceiling removed

**Deregulation**

- **1978**: Fed allowed banks to issue money market certificates with floating rate ceilings pegged to six-month Treasury bill—banks could now compete with money market funds (relaxation of Regulation Q)
- **March 1980**: Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act eliminated Regulation Q (deemed unsuccessful due to workarounds)
- **1986**: Ceilings gradually phased out

### Supervisory Guidance and "Direct Pressure"

**Guidance to Curtail Lending in Booms**

- **Post-WWI**: Fed wanted to direct credit toward productive rather than speculative uses via supervisory "direct pressure"
- **Mid-1927**: Policymakers nervous about stock market speculation
  - Previous year: stocks rose almost 100%, credit creation booming
  - **February 1929**: Fed issued statement denouncing speculation, stating it wouldn't lend to banks extending credit for speculation
  - Statement was "largely ineffectual" at stemming speculation

- **November 24, 1947**: Supervisors urged bank caution due to excessive credit creation and falling standards
  - Banks should "curtail all loans either to individuals or business for speculation in real estate, commodities or securities"

- **1990s-2000s**: Supervisors released several statements on deteriorating lending standards
  - **1995**: Fed warned examiners to watch for excessive easing in underwriting standards and risks of cyclical downturn in regional real estate (due to S&L crisis in 1980s)
  - **1999**: Statement detailed subprime lending risks, suggested raising capital standards for institutions engaged in practice (after several banks failed in previous year)
  - **Two years later**: Agencies quantified new capital standards—banks should hold 1.5x-3x more capital against subprime loans vs. similar assets
  - **Early and mid-2000s**: Federal officials expressed concern over frothy credit growth
  - **2005**: Guidance issued on home equity, commercial real estate lending, and nontraditional mortgages
  - **2013**: Fed and OCC tightened regulation of leveraged loans with 6x leverage limit and threatened fines

**Credit Availability During Busts**

- **April 1938**: President Roosevelt asked regulators to "agree on a more liberal bank examination policy"
  - Treasury and three federal supervisors issued joint statement outlining unified treatment of loans and securities
  - Moved away from mark-to-market accounting for securities
  - Distinguished "investment" vs. "speculative" securities (investment securities assigned top four rating agency grades)

- **End of S&L Crisis**: Administration moved to ease credit crunch
  - **May 1990**: OCC, Fed, FDIC leaders urged senior bank officials to extend loans
  - **March 1991**: Supervisors published report to "clarify regulatory policies"—did not ease standards despite stating "some depository institutions may have become overly cautious in their lending practices"

- **President Clinton**: Pursued new credit availability initiative with concurrent supervisory statement encouraging banks to lend
  - Attempted to make small business lending easier by reducing "appraisal burden" and enhancing appeals of examiners' decisions

- **2007-2009**: Supervisors encouraged banks to lend and work with distressed borrowers without weakening examination standards
