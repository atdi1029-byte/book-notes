# Big Debt Crises — Detailed Notes (Part 1)

## Introduction

### Core Premise

Ray Dalio writes on the 10th anniversary of 2008 to share his **template for understanding debt crises**. As an investor focused on relative values and capital flows (not just CPI/GDP), his perspective differs from economists/policymakers.

**Learning method**: After being "repeatedly bit by events I never encountered before," studied all major economic/market movements chronologically—experiencing them day-by-day as virtual experiences, making market bets knowing only what happened until that moment.

**Personal crises experienced**: Bretton Woods (1966-71), 1970s inflation bubble/1978-82 bursting, Latin American depression (1980s), Japanese bubble (late 1980s) and bursting (1988-91), tech bubble (2000), Great Deleveraging (2008).

### The Template

> "Though no two cases are exactly the same, they are similar enough that one can see the cause-effect relationships that drive them and use pattern recognition to identify where a country is in the process and what is likely to transpire."

**Core insight on managing debt crises**:

> "Managing debt crises is all about spreading out the pain of the bad debts, and this can almost always be done well if one's debts are in one's own currency. The biggest risks are typically not from the debts themselves, but from the failure of policy makers to do the right things due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority. If a nation's debts are in a foreign currency, much more difficult choices have to be made."

### Policy Maker Constraints

- Policy makers' understandings and authorities vary greatly across countries
- Tend not to react forcefully until crisis is extreme
- **Trade-off**: Strong checks/balances protect against power concentration but can prevent required policy moves during crisis
- Impossible to write rules anticipating all possibilities—unforeseen circumstances require instant response
- **Checks and balances can exacerbate crisis** by slowing decision-making and allowing narrow interests to block necessary moves
- Bold actions typically **criticized from all sides**

## Part 1: The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle

### Early Phase: Debt Rises Relative to Incomes

**The Bubble**: Debts rise faster than incomes needed to service them
- Self-reinforcing: rising asset prices → easier lending standards → more buying/speculation → higher prices
- Commonly financed by short-term debt to invest in longer-term/less-liquid/riskier assets
- Creates **asset/liability mismatch** making investors vulnerable to abrupt shifts in credit availability

**Classic bubble characteristics (all 7 present in 2004-2006 US housing)**:
1. Prices high relative to traditional measures
2. Prices discounting future rapid appreciation from already-high levels
3. Broad bullish sentiment
4. Purchases financed by high leverage
5. Extended forward purchases to speculate/protect against future gains
6. New buyers (previously not in market) have entered
7. Stimulative monetary policy inflates bubble; tight policy contributes to popping

**Fed's typical mistake**: Focus on CPI and growth, not debt growth. Worst bubbles (US 1929, Japan 1989) are **not accompanied by high goods/services inflation**, but by **asset price inflation financed by debt growth**.

### The Top

**Monetary policy tightening pops bubble**:
- Rising rates increase debt service on new and existing variable-rate debt
- Discourages borrowing, reduces disposable income → spending slows → incomes drop
- Rising short rates + flattening yield curve → liquidity declines
- Money moves from financial assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) → cash
- Declining asset prices create negative wealth effects

**Classic pattern**: No single event causes burst. Rising prices required leveraged buying to accelerate at unsustainable rate. Both speculators and lenders near/at max positions.

### The Depression

**Self-reinforcing debt crisis dynamics**:

> "Debt crises and downturns are self-reinforcing because as losses occur, both lenders and borrowers are less able to lend and borrow, which worsens conditions. When losses occur, capital declines, and because there are limits to how much one can hold in assets relative to capital, assets have to be sold. That in turn makes asset prices and lending weaker, producing more losses."

**Mark-to-market accounting + high leverage** makes crisis self-reinforcing.

**Classically: policy makers play with deflationary levers (austerity, debt reduction) for couple years but eventually wake up to fact the pain is too great and effects inadequate**. So more aggressive policies are undertaken.

> "Austerity seems like the obvious response, but the problem is that one person's spending is another person's income, so when spending is cut, incomes are also cut, with the result that it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in debt/income ratios."

### Classic Policy Mistake: The Austerity Trap

**Worries over deficit and push for austerity are classic responses** to depression phase of big debt crisis.

**Result**: Decreased borrowing/spending makes deleveraging self-reinforcing on downside (just as increased debts/spending caused self-reinforcing bubble on upside).

**Historical pattern**: All studied deleveragings eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, currency devaluations.

### The Beautiful Deleveraging

**When policy makers break from gold standard / print money**:

> "The devaluation and money printing kicked off a beautiful deleveraging."

**Key balance**: Deleveragings become beautiful when there's enough stimulation to offset deflationary forces and bring **nominal growth rate above nominal interest rate**.

**US 1933 example**:
- FDR left gold standard March 1933 → depression ended on a dime
- Dollar plunged, Fed decreased liquidity injections, rates fell 1-2%
- Dow up almost 100% over next four months
- All markets and statistics bottomed exactly when US left gold peg

**1936-37 tightening caused recession**:
- Fed doubled reserve requirements (Aug 1936-May 1937)
- Gold sterilization drew down liquidity
- Federal outlays fell 10% in 1937, another 10% in 1938
- Stocks fell nearly 60% by April 1938

### Policy Tools Summary

**Classic levers policy makers pull**:

1. **Monetary policy (easing/QE)**: Central bank prints money, buys government bonds and other assets
2. **Fiscal policy (deficits)**: Government spending increases and/or taxes reduced
3. **Debt restructuring/defaults**: Writing down debts so required payments consistent with debtors' abilities to pay
4. **Wealth transfers**: From haves to have-nots
5. **Macro-prudential measures**: Direct pressure on financial institutions to lend
6. **Accounting rule changes**: Allow losses to be written off over time to prevent ruin
7. **Guarantees/backstops**: For systemically important institutions
8. **Nationalization**: Taking equity stakes in failing banks

**Critical: best to provide too much support than too little**. Unlike Great Depression (when Fed let banks fail en masse), 2008's priority was saving the economy while minimizing moral hazard when possible.

## Part 2: Detailed Cases

## US Debt Crisis (1928-1937)

### The Roaring Twenties Bubble (1920s)

**Economic expansion**: 1922-29, real GDP grew 4.1%/year, per capita rose 2.7%/year

**Stock market mania**:
- Dow rose **497%** from 1921 low to Sept 1929 peak
- Final rally (May-Aug 1929): stocks rose 11%, 5%, 10% (three months)
- Rally supported by accelerating leverage: household margin debt rose $1.2 billion over three months

**Margin debt explosion**: From $1B (1921) to $8.5B (1929)—**almost 10% of GDP**

**Income distribution**: Top 1% earned ~24% of income, owned ~50% of wealth (near all-time highs)

### The Crash (October 1929)

**Market peaked Sept 3, 1929** at Dow 381 (wouldn't reach again for 25+ years).

**No specific event caused burst**—classic with bubbles: rising prices required leveraged buying to accelerate at unsustainable rate.

**Black Thursday (Oct 24)**:
- Dow hit low of 272 (down 33), bounced to close at 299
- **"Bankers' Pool"** committed $125M to buy shares—first of many failed attempts

**Black Monday (Oct 28)**: Dow fell **13.5%** (largest one-day loss in history)

**Black Tuesday (Oct 29)**:
- Fed injected $100M liquidity
- Dow closed down **11.7%** (second worst one-day loss)
- Market fallen 23% over two days

**By mid-November**: Dow down almost 50% from September peak

### Policy Response and Continued Decline (1929-1932)

**Federal Reserve easing**:
- Cut rates from 6% to 4.5% within a month
- March 1930: cut to 3.5% (total 2.5% cuts in 5 months)

**Fiscal stimulus**: Congress passed appropriations ~1% of GDP

**Misplaced optimism (early 1930)**: Believed correction was over. By April 1930, Dow rallied back above 290.

**Key insight**:

> "In the early stages of deleveragings, it's very common for investors and policy makers to underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren't enough."

**Economic deterioration**:
- May-Dec 1930: department store sales fell 8%, industrial production fell 17.6%
- Unemployment rose to 14%
- Though Fed decreased rates and Treasury bonds strong, **spreads continued to widen**—increased rates facing consumers/businesses

### Smoot-Hawley and Protectionism (1930)

**June 1930**: Smoot-Hawley imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports

- 1,028 economists issued open letter urging veto
- Foreign governments hinted at retaliation
- Stocks fell 5% week before passage, 7.9% day before
- Canada (20% of US exports) increased tariffs on 16 US goods
- **Accelerated collapse in global trade**

**Immigration restrictions (Sept 1930)**: Hoover banned immigration except tourists, students, professionals

### Bank Failures Begin (1930)

**Dec 11, 1930**: **Bank of the United States** failed (biggest single bank failure in history)
- 400,000 depositors, more than any bank at the time
- *NY Times* later: "The First Domino In the Depression"

**Gold standard constraint**:

> "Being on a gold standard is akin to having debts denominated in a foreign currency because creditors could demand payment in gold, and policy makers couldn't freely print money. So policy makers were working with a limited toolkit until they broke the link to gold."

**Federal Reserve constraints**: Could only lend to 35% of commercial banks (member banks). Banks often had to borrow from private sector and sell assets in fire sales.

### Depression Deepens (1931-1932)

**Germany dollar squeeze (mid-1931)**:
- American banks/companies held ~$1B in short-term German bills (6% of German GDP)
- Germany became popular "carry trade" destination
- Dollar shortage emerged as credit collapsed

**Austria's Credit Anstalt** failed May 1931, spreading bank runs across Europe

**Hoover Moratorium (June 1931)**: One-year suspension of war debt/reparations
- Dow rallied **12% in two days**, ended month 23% above June 2 low
- Rally proved insufficient—fundamental imbalances unresolved

**Sterling crisis (summer 1931)**:
- UK banks had large loans to Germany, couldn't get money out
- Run on sterling began July 24
- **Sept 19**: Bank of England abandoned gold standard
- Sterling fell **30% over next three months**
- UK stocks rose 11% in local currency terms

**US hit by contagion (fall 1931)**:
- Sterling devaluation created **deflationary pressure** in US
- Brought on **most painful period of depression** (lasted until FDR left gold 18 months later)
- Dow fell **30.7%** in September (largest monthly loss since crisis began)
- US lost **10% of gold reserves** within three weeks

**Fed tightening (Oct 1931)**: Raised discount rate 1.5% to 2.5%, then to 3.5%

> "Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic economy, so they don't work."

**Economic collapse accelerates (late 1931)**:
- Industrial production contracted 14.3%, department store sales fell 12.9%
- Unemployment reached nearly 20%
- Domestic prices falling 10%/year

### First Half 1932: Growing Intervention

**Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)**: Launched Jan 23
- $500M capital, could borrow up to $3B
- Lent to banks, rural institutions, railroads
- By Aug 1932: lent $1.3B to 5,520 financial institutions

**Banking Act of 1932** (signed Feb 27):
- Allowed Fed to print money to buy government bonds (**"quantitative easing"**)
- Sense of urgency: bill passed without debate
- Fed bought $1.5B government securities by June
- Three-month T-Bill yields fell over 2%

**Mark-to-market abandonment**: Comptroller instructed bank examiners to use par value instead of market value for bonds rated BAA+

**Market decline (March-May 1932)**: Dow dropped **50%** (88 to 44)

### Social Unrest (1932)

**Germany**: Hitler won most seats in Reichstag election
**Japan**: Invaded Manchuria (1931), Shanghai (1932)
**US**: Strikes increasing, unemployment approaching 25%

**Bonus Army (June 1932)**: Thousands of veterans marched on Washington
- July 28: Army troops led by MacArthur cleared camp with tanks and tear gas

### Political Backlash and Policy Paralysis (1932)

**RFC crisis**: Congress ordered publication of borrowers' names → accelerated withdrawals

**Hoover's budget austerity (Revenue Act of 1932)**:
- Raised income, corporation, excise taxes
- **Despite tax increases, deficit grew relative to GDP** (classic rookie move)

**Roosevelt's campaign**: Promised to maintain gold standard publicly, but politicians' promises during crisis are expedient and inconsistent with fundamentals

**Nov 1932**: Roosevelt won 22.8M votes to Hoover's 15.8M

**Nevada declared first statewide bank holiday** (Nov 1932)—sparked national panic

### Pre-Inauguration Crisis (1933)

**Guardian Detroit crisis (Feb 1933)**: Henry Ford refused to support Guardian Detroit Union Group → Michigan statewide bank holiday

> "When policy makers fail to rescue systemically important institutions, ripple effects spread quickly."

**Systemic contagion**: By March 4, withdrawal restrictions in over 30 states

**Last two weeks of Feb**: NY Fed lost **$250M** (nearly 25% of gold reserves)

**March 1933**: GNP hit lowest point—**$55.6B, 31.5% below 1929**

### The Beautiful Deleveraging (March 1933 onward)

**March 5, 1933**: Roosevelt's decisive action
- **Four-day national bank holiday**
- Suspended gold exports (delinking from gold)
- **Emergency Banking Act**: Fed could issue dollars backed by bank assets instead of gold

**Bank triage**:
- Systemically important banks always supported; smaller banks often allowed to fail
- Undercapitalized banks: RFC issued preferred shares, merged with healthier banks, or closed
- Treasury guaranteed liabilities of every bank they chose to keep open

**Roosevelt's radio address (March 12)**:

> "The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets...I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress."

**Public restored confidence**: Deposited **>$1B** when banks reopened (instead of runs)

**When markets opened**: Dow rose **15.3%**, commodities soared

**Depression ended on a dime**: All markets and statistics bottomed exactly when US left gold peg

**Roosevelt's policy avalanche (first six months)**:
- April 5: Outlawed public gold ownership, banned private gold exports
- May 27: Securities Act regulated securities sale
- June 5: Banned "Gold Clauses" in contracts
- June 13: Home Owner's Loan Corporation refinanced residential mortgages
- June 16: Banking Act (Glass-Steagall II) created FDIC deposit insurance
- Federal spending increased **$2.7B (5% of GDP) by 1934**

**Beautiful deleveraging formula**: Enough stimulation to offset deflationary forces and bring nominal growth above nominal interest rate

**Economic rebound**:
- Heavy machinery orders climbed 100%, industrial production up ~50%
- March-July: nondurable manufacturing up 35%, durable up 83%
- Unemployment fell, wholesale prices jumped 45%
- Total debt level (%GDP) began declining

### 1936-1937: Tightening Causes Recession

**Fed concerns about excess reserves and inflation** led to premature tightening:

**Reserve requirement increases (Aug 1936-May 1937)**:
- Central Reserve City: 13% → 26%
- Reserve City: 10% → 20%
- Country banks: 7% → 14%
- Time Deposits: 3% → 6%
- Excess reserves fell from $3B to <$1B

**Gold sterilization (Dec 1936-July 1937)**: ~$1.3B gold inflows sterilized

**Fiscal tightening**: Federal outlays fell 10% in 1937, another 10% in 1938

**Economic collapse**:
- Stocks fell nearly **60%** by April 1938
- Unemployment rose to 15%
- Credit growth slowed across all sectors

**Policy reversal (late 1937-1938)**:
- Fed lowered reserve requirements back to 1936 levels
- Treasury reversed sterilization
- Deficit spending rose to ~3% of GDP by start of 1939
- Markets began recovering in 1938

---

## US Debt Crisis (2007-2011)

### The Housing Bubble (2004-2006)

**"Goldilocks economy"**: Growth 3-4%, unemployment 4-5%, inflation 2-3.5%—but **debt/GDP growth: 12.6% annually**

**Housing price acceleration**:
- 2004-2006: home prices rose ~30%
- Since 2000: >80% total increase
- **Fastest pace in a century** (except immediate post-WWII)

**Debt explosion**:
- Household debt: 85% of disposable income (2000) → ~120% (2006)
- Home equity loans + cash-out refinancing: **$500B in 2005** (5x 1998 level)
- Total US debt exceeded **300% of GDP**

**Credit standards deteriorated as prices rose**:
- Banks didn't require proof of income
- Adjustable rate mortgages with low "teaser" rates
- **Subprime mortgages** became 20% of market
- Loan-to-value ratio on new loans: fast increase to 80%

**Speculation**:
- "Home flippers" buying for short-term profit
- New single-family construction **doubled 1995-2005**
- Peak: ~8% of households buying home each year (50% more than today)
- TIME magazine (summer 2005): "Will Your House Make You Rich?"

**Fed policy mistake**:

> "The worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising goods and services inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. Typically, central banks make the mistake of accommodating the debt growth because they are focused on goods and services inflation (CPI) and/or growth. They are not focused on debt growth."

### The Shadow Banking System

**Five components fueling leverage outside traditional banking**:

1. **Repo and commercial paper**: Huge channels for short-term borrowing
2. **Large institutional depositors**: Demand for Treasury securities outstripped supply → created demand for substitutes
3. **Money market funds**: Short-term savings promising higher returns
4. **Globalization of dollar lending**: Explosion of dollar borrowing/lending outside US banks
5. **Securitization**: Banks originate loans and sell to investors → **moral hazard** (no consequence for risky loans)

**Regulatory failure**: US regulatory system didn't keep pace. No adequate visibility, authorities lacked powers to curb excesses.

**Asset/liability mismatches** (all three occurred):
1. Borrowing short-term, lending long-term
2. Lending to risky borrowers at higher rates
3. Borrowing in one currency, lending in another

### The Top (2007)

**Subprime problems grow (early 2007)**:
- Jan 4: SEC memo: "business model of many smaller subprime originators no longer viable"
- **New Century** (second biggest subprime lender) had 2.5% first payment defaults → went bust

**Bernanke (March 28)**: "impact on broader economy and financial markets of problems in subprime market seems likely to be contained."

**Bear Stearns hedge funds (mid-June)**:
- Two funds holding subprime MBS (one leveraged 20:1) faced losses and redemptions
- Required fire-sale of $3.6B securities
- Leveraged financial buying shifted to deleveraging selling

**Rising rates and tightening (mid-2007)**:
- Mid-June: 10-year Treasury yields hit 5.3% (highest since 2002)
- Mid-July: 90-day T-bill rate hit 5%, flat yield curve—cyclical peak

> "When people spend less, prices go down, and economic activity decreases. Declining asset prices create negative wealth effects, feeding back into economy through declining spending and incomes."

**Dalio's warning (July 26, 2007)**:

> "Crazy lending and leveraging creating pervasive fragility. Interest rates will rise until financial system cracks. Everything will reverse: move from greed to fear, volatilities increase, carry and credit spreads blow out. **No one knows how financial market contagion will play out**...These exposures grown rapidly (~4x larger than five years ago), huge (~$400 trillion)."

### August 2007: Serious Unraveling

**Aug 9**: **BNP Paribas** froze $2.2B in three funds due to US subprime exposure

- European banks nervous about lending to each other
- **ECB** injected 95B euros, then another 61B next day
- **TED spread** spiked—clear signal top of debt cycle being made

**Aug 10 (BDO)**: "This Is the Big One"
- Like 1998 or 1994, just bigger
- Will run through system with hurricane speed (next 4-6 months)
- Leave weaker credits dead/damaged, stronger ones in catbird seat

**Countrywide** (largest US mortgage issuer) exhausted credit line, at risk of bankruptcy

**Fed cut rates 0.5%** (unusual between-meetings move). Markets recovered. Most thought problems would be contained.

### VAR Problem

**Value at Risk (VAR)**: Measure of recent volatility, commonly used for position sizing

> "Investors looked at recent volatility in their VAR calculations, and by and large expected it to continue moving forward. This is human nature and it was dumb because past volatility and past correlations aren't reliable forecasts of future risks."

- Low volatility → increased leverage (some ratios neared 100:1)
- VAR was self-reinforcing on downside: increased volatility → triggered more selling

### Fall 2007: Policy Responses

**Sept 18 rate cut**: Fed cut 0.5% (vs. 0.25% expected)
- Sparked "ecstatic" rally—S&P 500 returned to within 2% of all-time high
- **But**: easing wouldn't solve fundamental problem (more debt/liabilities than could be serviced)

**Oct 9, 2007**: S&P 500 closed at all-time high—wouldn't be reached again until 2013

**The moral hazard question**:

> "How the 'moral hazard' question is dealt with during big debt crises is one of the biggest determinants of how these crises turn out...Above all else, most important thing is to provide life-blood (stimulants) to keep systemically important parts alive. Better to err on providing too much than too little."

**Geithner**: Moral hazard framework = wrong way to think about crisis policy. Providing liquidity during liquidity crisis leaves government open to less risk. **Paradox**: if you let things burn, government ends up taking on all risk through costly nationalization.

### Crisis Spreads to Europe (Fall 2007)

**Northern Rock** (British bank): Run mid-September 2007 (depositors lining up three days to withdraw)
- UK government guaranteed all deposits

**Large European banks** (UBS, Deutsche Bank) owned subprime securitizations
- **AAA subprime securities had 0% default rate** historically → premium far too small for actual risk

### Year-End 2007

- S&P 500: down 6% from Oct peak, positive for year
- Bond yields: declined from ~5% (June) to ~4% (year end)
- Dollar index: down 8.6%
- Oil: up 55% to $96

---

## 2008: Depression

### January-February: Emergency Actions

**Major write-downs**: Citigroup $22.2B, Merrill Lynch $14.1B

**Jan 22**: Fed emergency rate cut **0.75%** (biggest short-term cut since Oct 1984)
- Week later: cut another **0.5%**
- Largest calendar month decline in short rates since 1987

**Senate passed $160B stimulus package** (tax rebates)

**UBS report**: Losses from mortgage-backed securities could total **$600B** in US financial system

**Bridgewater (Jan 31)**: "Not Just a Normal Recession"

> "Different from Japan 1990s and US 1930s—better characterized as 'D' (deleveraging). Financial deleveraging causes financial crisis that causes economic crisis."

### March 2008: Bear Stearns Rescue

**Bear Stearns crisis**:
- Held $400B securities, nearly 400 subsidiaries, 5,000 trading counterparties, 750,000 open derivatives contracts
- **Bernanke**: Not "too big to fail" but **"too interconnected to fail"**
- Greatest fear: collapse could trigger **$2.8 trillion tri-party repo market** collapse

**Fed's intervention**:
- Announced **$200B Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)**
- March 10-14: Bear's **$18B cash buffer disappeared** in 4 days

**Weekend rescue (March 16)**:
- **JPMorgan** bought Bear at $2/share (peak was $173)
- Fed provided JPM **$30B non-recourse loan** secured by Bear's mortgage pool

**Leadership team**:
- **Paulson**: 30+ years at Goldman (8 as CEO), forceful leadership
- **Bernanke**: world's foremost Great Depression expert
- **Geithner**: 20 years economic policy experience, oversaw biggest banks

**But**: Lacked legal authority for necessary interventions. Required willing private sector buyer to save investment banks.

### Post-Rescue Rally (April-May)

Markets rallied but underlying deterioration continued:
- Unemployment climbing, consumer confidence falling
- Manufacturing/services contracting
- Fresh write-downs: UBS $19B, Deutsche $4B, AIG $7.8B

**Simultaneous pressures**: Oil hit $130, dollar falling, Fed faced dilemma (ease vs. fight inflation)

### Summer 2008: Stagflation

**June**: S&P fell 9% (surging oil, credit problems, poor stats)

**Credit problems intensified**:
- Lehman, Merrill, Morgan Stanley downgraded by S&P
- Moody's: MBIA and Ambac likely to lose AAA ratings
- Home foreclosures/delinquency rates accelerating

**Economic deterioration**:
- Unemployment surged to 5.6% (largest monthly increase in two decades)
- Manufacturing declined fourth month
- Headline inflation rose to 4.4%

**Fannie/Freddie crisis (July)**:
- Lehman report: needed **$75B capital infusion** to remain solvent
- Shares declined ~45% each following week
- Treasury/Fed announced GSEs could tap public funding if on verge of collapse

### Taking Control of Fannie/Freddie

**Background**: Created 1938/1970 to stabilize mortgage market
- By 2007: Twenty times larger than Bear Stearns
- Owned or guaranteed **$5 trillion** in mortgages/MBS (about half US total)
- $1.7 trillion debt outstanding, ~20% held by international investors

**Perverse incentives**:

> "Government guarantees (implicit or explicit) make risky assets appear safer, encouraging investors to lever up, feeding bad debt growth."

**Political power** (Larry Summers):

> "Fannie and Freddie had vast political power. When we said anything raising concern, they arranged for Treasury to receive 40,000 pieces of mail...They had arranged for the Treasury Advisory Borrowing Committee to say Fannie and Freddie are vital contributors to our financial systems."

**July 23 takeover authority**: Congress granted Treasury "unspecified" (virtually unlimited) amount
- Extended regulatory oversight
- Treasury acquired "blank check, backstopped by taxpayer"

**Sept 5-7**: Treasury/Fed/OCC/FDIC pressure convinced FHFA to put GSEs into conservatorship
- Both companies **tens of billions underwater**
- Paulson "ambushed" to avoid friction/delay

### September 2008: The Crash

**Sept 7**: Fannie/Freddie nationalized
- Markets rose ~2% Monday
- But **Lehman** trading down 80%

**Legal constraints on saving Lehman**:
- No clear legal path to save failing investment banks
- Fed could lend for liquidity, but Lehman faced **solvency problem**
- Needed private buyer (like Bear had JPMorgan)

> "A solvency problem can only be dealt with by providing more equity capital (or changing accounting/regulatory rules)."

**Failed rescue attempts**:
- Barclays, Bank of America expressed interest but wanted government support
- Treasury publicly insisted no support would come
- Without buyer, Fed lacked "effective authorities in preventing failure of a nonbank in midst of panic-driven run"

**Bernanke/Geithner constraints**:
- Legal requirement that loan be "secured to their satisfaction" limited lending amount
- Couldn't lend Lehman enough to save it or guarantee trading book
- **Section 13(3)** allowed emergency lending but "did not make them alchemists"
- "Loans were not equity"

> "Classic example of how political constraints together with imperfectly thought-out legal constraints can get in the way of actions that are widely agreed to be beneficial."

**Sunday Sept 14**: Lehman headed for bankruptcy—"all hell broke loose"

**Lehman's derivatives exposure**:
- Party to **$4-6 trillion in CDS exposure** (~8% of total market)
- No one knew net exposure size or who was on other side
- Largest bankruptcy in US history—**$600B in assets**

**Sept 15 (BDO)**: "Where We Are Now"

> "So, now we sit and wait to see if they have some hidden trick up their sleeves or if they really are as reckless as they seem. It appears that we are headed into a new domain in which the classic monetary tools won't work and the Japan in the 1990s and US in the 1930's dynamic will drive things."

### September 16-18: Emergency Interventions

**Sept 16**: Fed's **$85B bailout of AIG**
- Most radical intervention in private business in central bank's history
- Tough terms: 11.5% floating rate, 80% government ownership

**Credit markets seize up**:
- Interbank lending seized, Libor settled at almost twice prior week
- Prime money market funds showing stress
- Morgan Stanley credit spreads wider than Lehman's on Friday

**Sept 18**: Treasury/Fed announce **TARP**
- Plan to buy troubled mortgages at deep discounts
- Fed unveiled **$180B in new swap lines** for global central banks
- Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became bank holding companies

**Money market fund guarantee**:
- **Reserve Primary Fund** "broke the buck" Sept 16 → runs on funds
- **Hundreds of billions of dollars funding day-to-day business operations dried up in days**
- Paulson tapped **$50B Exchange Stabilization Fund** to guarantee money market funds
- "When you say something is a guarantee (not just backstop), much more reassuring to investors"

### September 29: House Rejects TARP

- Bill failed in House vote
- Stocks fell **8.8%** (largest single-day drop since 1987)
- Oil fell $10
- Interbank lending markets froze

**Importance of authority and speed**:

> "Among the most important aspects of successfully managing a crisis is having wise and knowledgeable decision-makers who have the authority to do whatever it takes."

**Political obstacles**:
- TARP considered one month before presidential election
- Republicans hated abandoning free-market principles
- Democrats worried about giving legislative win to outgoing Republican administration
- If either candidate took populist stand, bill would have "little chance of passing"

**Capital injection strategy**: Rather than distinguish healthy from unhealthy banks (time-consuming, stigmatizing), Treasury offered to buy **preferred stocks on very attractive terms**
- Allowed capital injection into 700 banks very quickly
- Taxpayers ultimately profited ~$50B from TARP capital programs

**Oct 3**: TARP eventually passed—"extraordinary accomplishment" as rare bipartisan action

> "Political systems typically make the right decisions only after heated fighting and literally just hours before disaster is about to strike."

### October 2008: Maximum Scramble

**First days of October** = "a scramble to get as much done in as short a time as possible"

**FDIC actions**:
- Raised deposit insurance from $100K to $250K
- Added Transaction Account Guarantee Program (fully guaranteed non-interest bearing accounts)

**Stock market collapse**: Oct 1-10, S&P 500 lost **22%** without single day of gains

**Policy response: Commercial Paper Funding Facility** (Oct 7)
- Fed would purchase unsecured commercial paper
- Extraordinary authority—took Fed to edge/beyond statutory authority

### Columbus Day Weekend: G7 Coordination (Oct 11-13)

**Saturday Oct 11**: President Bush met G7 for coordinated effort
- Agreed to inject capital into banking institutions
- Increase deposit insurance guarantees

**Two bold centerpieces**:

1. **Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program** (FDIC)
   - Guarantee debt of any systemically important bank
   - Backstop losses on all newly issued unsecured bank debt
   - Amounted to guarantee of nearly all bank debt

> "To be frank, I hated these options, but I didn't want to preside over a meltdown." —Hank Paulson

2. **Capital Purchase Program** (Treasury)
   - Equity stakes in as many banks as possible
   - Limit: 3% of risk-weighted assets or $250B
   - Monday Oct 13: Paulson invited nine major bank CEOs—none left without taking government money

**Market reaction (Oct 13)**: Stocks rallied **11.6%** (largest single-day increase in S&P 500 since 1939)

**Turning point**: Increasingly clear US and global policy makers committed to "taking extraordinary, coordinated action"

**Credit conditions begin thawing** (Oct 20):
- Commercial paper rates touched four-week lows
- Short-term treasury yields crept up

**Global dollar squeeze**:
- Foreign institutions borrowed dollars, now had to pay back when dollars scarce
- Dollar rallied 8% in October

### November-December 2008: Freefall Accelerates

**Nov 4**: Obama elected with big majorities in both houses

> "While the financial contagion may have been slowed by Treasury and Fed's actions, it became clearer in last couple months of 2008 that economy was falling at far faster pace than even most pessimistic observers feared, and that we were heading for worst downturn since Great Depression."

**Economic implosion**:
- Consumer spending fell at extraordinary rate
- Retail sales fell 8%+, auto sales down 30% year-over-year
- Unemployment moved past 6.8%
- December: worst manufacturing reading since 1982

**Nov 10**: AIG reported $25B quarterly loss (secured additional $150B)

**Mid-November**: Paulson announced plans for modifying TARP use
- No longer buy illiquid assets (market frozen)
- Funds to banks and nonbank financials as equity-like capital
- New lending program for consumer lending markets

**Nov 20**: Stocks reached new low, down 20%+ for month (52% from highs)

**First Quantitative Easing (Nov 25)**:
- Fed and Treasury announced **$800B** in lending and asset purchases
- Central bank committed to **$600B** purchases of debt tied to home loans

> "Central bankers in crises forced to choose between printing more money to replace decline in private credit or allowing big tightening as credit collapses. They inevitably choose to print, which is when things changed dramatically."

**Comparison to 1930s**:

> "What was different in 2008 was the speed with which policy makers made this crucial step. The 1930-33 depression went on so long because policy makers were so slow to react—not because their problems were worse. Still, 2008 crisis would have been a lot less painful if policy makers had acted even earlier."

**Auto industry bailout (Dec 19)**: Bush extended $13.4B emergency loans to Chrysler/GM

## 2009: Transition to Beautiful Deleveraging

### Historical Parallel

Understanding **Great Depression template** proved critical to navigating 2008-2009.

**Only two times since 1900** that rates reached 0% and QE followed:
1. 1933 (US Great Depression)
2. 2008

In both cases, **markets and economy bottomed immediately after**.

> "Quantitative easing is like a giant shot of adrenalin to save a patient having a massive heart attack. The only question was if this overdue and great move would work or if it had come too late."

### Early 2009: Economic Freefall

**Jan 2009 (BDO)**:
- Economy in freefall—credit contraction hitting employment hardest
- Five major institutions at risk: Fannie, Freddie, AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America (each larger than Lehman)
- Payroll reductions exceeded 500,000/month Nov-Dec

**Feb 10**: Geithner's Financial Stability Plan
- Announced plan to stress test major banks
- Market reaction: S&P fell 4.9%
- Investors uncertain about nationalizations, who bears losses

**Stress test design**: Fed would assess banks under major contraction (3.3% GDP contraction, 8.9% unemployment, 22% fall in housing prices)

**Fiscal stimulus (Feb 17)**: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
- **$787B total**: $288B tax reductions, $144B state/local, $105B infrastructure
- Tax reduction funneled to taxpayers **within days**

**Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (Feb 18)**:
- Up to **$275B** to address housing crisis
- Help as many as 9M homeowners refinance or avert foreclosure

**TALF**: Fed lending up to **$1T on non-recourse basis** to AAA asset-backed securities holders

### March 2009: The Bottom

**March 1**: AIG to report **$62B 4Q loss** (largest quarterly loss in US corporate history)
- Treasury/Fed agreed to provide additional $30B

**March 9**: World Bank pessimistic report, Buffett said economy "fallen off a cliff"
- Stock market fell 1%, investor sentiment extremely bearish, selling exhausted
- **Day the bottom in US stock market and top in dollar were made** (unknowable at the time)

**March 10**: Stocks surged **6.4%**, led by 38% Citigroup jump
- Citigroup CEO memo: bank "once again profitable"

### March-April: "Shock and Awe" Campaign

**March 18: Expanded QE**
- Fed announced **$750B Agency MBS, $100B agency debt**
- Would expand to **US government bonds—up to $300B over next six months**
- **Total $1 trillion+**
- Market reaction: enormous Treasury rally—**48 basis point fall in yields** (biggest change in decades)

**March 23: Public-Private Investment Partnership (PPIP)**
- Geithner announced plan to buy **$500B to $1 trillion** troubled assets
- Allowed firms to leverage investments using Fed-borrowed money
- Guarantee: would not lose more than initial investment
- S&P rose **7.1%**, led by 18% financial rally

**April 2: Two major announcements**

1. **G20 IMF funding expansion**: Greater than expected increase to IMF funding
   - Immediately provide **$250B**, aim to add **up to $500B** in new lending capacity
   - Emerging currencies soared

2. **FASB eases mark-to-market rules**: Gave banks more discretion in reporting value of mortgage securities

**Scale of government response**: By April 2009, **US government was backstopping 2/3 of all debt, about $29 trillion**

### Obama's Leadership Style

**Contrast with Bush**:
- Bush: hands-off, believed team knew best
- Obama: hands-on, digging into facts/numbers
- Instituted **presidential daily economic briefing**

**Larry Summers**: President read every word they sent him, very much into understanding approach and alternatives.

### The Classic Dilemma

**Public uproar** over Treasury's actions, especially AIG bonuses

> "As economic pain increases, populist calls to 'punish the bankers that caused this mess' are the norm and they make it difficult for policy makers to take actions necessary to save the financial system and the economy."

**Larry Summers** comparison to **battlefield medicine**—never perfect, you're going to realize mistakes, look bad even if you do best job.

> "In the end, saving the system is much more important than striving for precision."

**Geithner on public outrage**:

> "The public outrage was appropriate, and I understood why the President wanted to embrace it, but I didn't see how we could ever satisfy it...I feared the tougher we talked about bonuses, the more we would own them, fueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry."

### Market Dynamics: Tops and Bottoms

**Key insight**:

> "Tops are typically made when the rate of buying is unsustainable (when people think prices will rise) and bottoms are made when the rate of selling is at a pace that's unsustainable (typically when most people are bearish)."

**Mid-April rally**:
- S&P up 25%, oil up 20%+, bank CDS spreads fell almost 30%
- But appeared more due to **slower rate of selling than pickup in buying**

**Uncertainty**: There had been classic bear market rallies along the way (19% in late Oct, 24% over last six weeks of 2008 before new lows). Was this the true bottom or another false rally?

### June-December: Recovery Phase Begins

**Second half 2009**: QE, fiscal stimulus, macro-prudential measures reduced risk
- S&P 500 climbed from ~650 to ~1,100 by December
- 13% total returns for 2010

**Inflation fears prove unfounded**:

> "Reflations don't necessarily cause inflation because they can simply negate deflations, depending on how far they are taken and what the money goes to."

**Regulatory reform timeline**:
- June 17: Obama speech proposing comprehensive financial reform (eventually Dodd-Frank)
- June 24: SEC proposed money market fund regulations
- October 22: Fed proposed review of 28 banking organizations' compensation policies
- December 11: House passed Financial Stability Council and Consumer Financial Protection Agency

**Pattern**: Changing laws to prevent crisis is typical at end of big debt crises. Then over long time frames (~25 years), hangover wears off, new euphoria sets in, laws flouted, new leverage forms produced, leads to new debt crisis.

## 2010-2011: Premature Normalization Fears

### Economic Disconnect (Early 2010)

- Financial markets strong (up 65% from March 2009 lows)—flush with Fed QE liquidity
- But economy labored: borrowers weaker/cautious, lending standards tightened
- Credit markets priced Fed would tighten 2-3 times within year—odd given conditions

**Global stimulus slowdown**:
- Fed ended first QE round March 2010 after purchasing $1.25T in MBS
- Fiscal stimulus set to peak
- China increased interest rates

### The QE Debate: Flow vs. Amount

**Critically misunderstood**: merely slowing/ending QE was equivalent to tightening

- Some thought pumping money enough (Fed had printed >$2T)
- But **flow of money more important than amount**—flow of asset purchases sustained value increases and lending growth

**BDO Feb 17**: "The Coming Tightening"

> "It is now the established view among the electorate, central bankers, and elected officials that central banks printing and buying of financial assets and central governments budget deficits must be reined in because these actions are financially irresponsible. We think that this universally accepted view is at best premature and at worst dangerous."

### European Debt Crisis Emerges

**February 2010**: Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Spain, especially **Greece** struggled with debt obligations

**BDO Feb 4**:

> "We judge the over-indebtedness problems of the European debtor countries (PIGS) to be comparable in magnitude to some of the worst emerging-market debt problems of the past."

**European policy mistakes**: Same sequence as US 1930s
- Didn't believe they'd face debt crisis until they had it
- Leaned too heavily on deflationary levers (austerity)
- Not printing money, not providing default protections for systemically important entities
- Until pain became intolerable

### Market Correction (May-July 2010)

- US equity rallied nearly 10% through late April
- Fell over 15% May-July on Europe contagion worries and weak US numbers
- US bond yields fell over 100 basis points

### Bernanke's Jackson Hole Speech (August 2010)

Addressed further QE, making clear it was key policy option:

> "A first option for providing additional monetary accommodation, if necessary, is to expand the Federal Reserve's holdings of longer-term securities."

- Emphasized belief QE had been effective
- After signaling further QE strong possibility, markets rebounded strongly

**Bill Dudley** (Oct 2010): Conditions "wholly unsatisfactory," argued "further action likely to be warranted"

### BDO Oct 6: The Next Shoe to Drop

> "What is happening is all very classic. Though they're all different, in most ways deleveragings are basically the same and transpire via a similar sequence of events."

**All deleveragings require**:
- Declines in private sector credit growth
- Increases in central bank money creation AND central government deficits to offset

> "Austerity to deal with debt-deleveraging has never worked when problems were big. When tried persistently, eventually abandoned by all governments (didn't work, too painful)."

**Result**: All studied deleveragings eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, stocks).

### QE2 Broadly Worked

Despite continued Europe debt problems, US economy/markets finished 2010 on high note:
- Growth picked up after brief lull between QE1 and QE2
- S&P 500 had 13% total returns for 2010
- Inflation expectations re-anchored by Fed's proven determination

### Case Study Endpoint: Q2 2011

End case study here because **Q2 2011**: real GDP returned to pre-crisis levels

**US financial system success metrics** (compared to other countries):
- Relatively fast speed at which financial system recapitalized (and TARP capital repaid)
- Relatively fast speed unwound emergency credit programs
- Good overall financial returns on rescue across programs

[Note: This section begins in the source material but would continue in Part 2]

# Big Debt Crises - Part 2 Compacted Notes

## Glossary of Key Terms

### Balance of Payments Terms
- **Balance-of-payments crisis**: Country entities lack adequate buying power in world markets; run out of cash and credit
- **Capital inflows/outflows**: Cross-border money/credit movement for capital/investment assets
- **Currency peg**: Exchange rate policy fixing currency value to another currency, mix, or asset (e.g., gold)
- **Current account balance**: Exports minus imports plus net income receipts; deficit requires capital transactions to make up difference
- **FX debt**: Debt denominated in currency other than investor's home country
- **Real FX**: Currency cheapness/expensiveness measure; positive = expensive, negative = cheaper
- **Reserves**: Country's foreign currency/gold savings used for purchases and currency market intervention

### Debt and Crisis Terms
- **Bubble**: Self-reinforcing, unsustainable rises in debt, asset prices, growth; temporary boom followed by bust
- **Depression**: Severe downturn with self-reinforcing declines when central banks limited in ability to ease
- **Deleveraging**: Process of reducing debt burdens
- **Deleveraging attribution**: Bridgewater analysis decomposing debt burden changes into GDP factors (inflation, real growth) and debt factors (borrowing)

### Growth Metrics
- **GDP gap**: Difference between current production vs. sustainable level (economy's "potential"); negative = slack
- **Nominal growth**: Change in value (price × quantity) of GDP, includes inflation
- **Real growth**: Change in quantity of goods/services produced (inflation-adjusted)

### Interest and Inflation
- **Real interest rates**: Rates adjusted to remove inflation; negative real rate = lenders lose buying power
- **Liquidity**: Money/credit scarcity vs. availability; low liquidity = scarce, high liquidity = easily available
- **Long rate**: Interest on longer-term debt (typically 10-year government bond)
- **Short rate**: Interest on lending for very short periods (usually 3 months or less)

### Policy Terms
- **Easing/Stimulation**: Making money/credit more available via lower rates, printing money, changing regulations
- **Tightening**: Reducing money/credit availability, slowing growth via higher rates, cutting spending
- **Fiscal balance**: Whether government spending exceeds tax revenue
- **Money 0 (M0)**: Total printed money (physical currency + reserves at central bank)
- **Reflation**: When monetary policy easy/stimulative and helps produce economic recovery
- **Yield curve**: Difference between short-term and long-term rates; inverted = short above long

## Key Policy Lessons Across Cases

### Critical Policy Choice in Currency Crises
> "A key determinant of how balance of payments/currency crises play out is how policy makers respond to adverse capital flows: whether they let their currency go and allow a tightening of financial conditions to flow through (painful but typically necessary to resolve the crisis), or print money to make up for money leaving (which can be inflationary)."

### The Classic 9 Policy Levers
1. Nationalize banks
2. Provide liquidity
3. Directly purchase troubled assets
4. IMF assistance programs
5. Structural reforms (labor market flexibility)
6. Breaking currency pegs
7. Money supply expansion
8. Interest rate cuts
9. Currency depreciation

### Deleveraging Mechanisms
- **"Beautiful deleveraging"**: Debt-to-income reduction via income rising (real growth + inflation)
- **"Ugly deleveraging"**: Debt-to-income rising despite depression due to falling incomes
- **Deflationary deleveraging**: Relies on real growth and stable/positive inflation
- **Inflationary deleveraging**: Uses inflation (sometimes extreme) to erode real debt burden
- **Hyperinflationary deleveraging**: Inflation >1,000%; requires structural changes (new currency)

### Recovery Timelines
- GDP recovery: typically **2-9 years** to reach prior peak
- Equity recovery: typically **2-25 years** in USD terms
- Faster recoveries generally associated with:
  - Aggressive policy response (6-9 of 9 levers)
  - Early currency peg abandonment
  - Strong real growth during reflation
  - Lower starting debt/GDP ratios

### Political Consequences
- Severe debt crises frequently lead to **populist leaders** taking power
- Economic pain creates political opportunity for leadership change
- Examples: FDR (US), Tojo (Japan), Blum (France), Garcia Perez (Peru), Menem (Argentina), Conte (Italy), Orban (Hungary), Tsipras (Greece), Thaksin (Thailand), Estrada (Philippines), Duhalde (Argentina), Gutierrez (Ecuador)

### Risk Factors for Inflation Spirals
Most common risk factors:
1. **Long history of poorly-controlled inflation** (biggest single factor)
2. **High foreign-denominated debts**
3. **Low real short-term interest rates**
4. **Large fiscal deficits**
5. **Current account deficits**
6. **Low central bank reserves**

### Foreign Currency Debt Creates Amplification
- Currency depreciation mechanically increases FX debt burden in local terms
- Creates "debt paradox": debt/GDP rises during depression even as economy contracts
- Most severe crises had >25% of GDP in foreign currency debt
- Euro-denominated debt created similar dynamics for peripheral Europe

## Appendix: Macroprudential Policies

### Definition and Purpose
- **Macroprudential policies** = tools for directing credit through central bank's regulatory authorities
- Distinct from monetary policy (broadly available) and fiscal policy (apportions credit)
- Sits between monetary and fiscal: targets specific sectors/asset classes
- Classic countercyclical approach: easier standards during busts, harder during bubbles

### Historical Context
- **Not new**: Fed changed margin requirements **23 times** since formation
- 1990s-mid-2000s = historical exception when macroprudential tools became rare
- Post-crisis: global return to macroprudential as key management instrument

### When Deployed
- Economy needs stimulation but rates already at zero
- Tightening needed in specific areas but overall rate hikes would drag growth
- QE fuels pockets of frothiness while broader economy still recovering
- Redirect credit from credit-starved sectors away from frothy assets

### Policy Tools Taxonomy

**Demand-side measures** (changing demand for credit):
- Loan-to-value ratios
- Debt service-to-income ratios
- Loan maturity requirements
- Margin requirements for financial assets
- Cost of loans via interest rate subsidies/tax policy/regulations

**Supply-side measures** (changing supply of credit):
- Capital/reserve requirements for certain lending types
- Portfolio restrictions on assets financial institutions can hold
- Accounting rules on different assets
- Supervisor pressure for certain lending behaviors
- Interest/lending rate ceilings and limitations

### Coordination Requirements
Most successful cases = Fed + Congress + executive branch + regulatory bodies coordinated
- Lawmakers armed government bodies with tools and authority
- New institutions created to implement and monitor
- Example: WWII effort—Congress revised laws, Roosevelt used executive orders

### Implementation Success Factors
**What worked:**
- Effective policies used for long periods or expanded
- Significant experimentation and flexibility critical
- Financial system evolution → changing toolset as trade-offs shifted
- Policies adapted or abandoned when circumvented

**What didn't work:**
- Policies with bad second-order consequences continued too long
- **Regulation Q**: caps on deposit interest rates helped initially (1930s), created distortions by 1950s
- **S&L deregulation (early 1980s)**: meant to help institutions cope, contributed to S&L crisis

### Historical Applications

**Margin Requirements (post-1934):**
- Securities Exchange Act gave Fed ability to set margin requirements
- Used counter-cyclically: increase during booms, decrease during busts
- **Regulation T** (brokers) and **Regulation U** (banks)
- Mostly stopped using post-1974 (derivatives enabled sidestepping)

**Underwriting Standards:**
- **Great Depression era**: Federal Home Loan Bank System (1932), FHA (1934) eased standards
- **WWII**: Roosevelt executive order limited installment credit for consumer durables
- **Postwar**: Regulation X (1950) tightened housing credit, reversed mid-1953
- **Late-1954**: Multi-pronged approach to frothy housing market
- **1982**: Congress abolished loan-to-value and maturity restrictions for national banks

**Voluntary Guidelines:**
- 1947, 1950 (Korean War), 1965 (balance of payments), 1966 (business loans)
- **Carter's Special Credit Restraint Program (1980)**: limited loan growth to 6-9%, targeted speculative lending
- European parallels: France and Italy national credit councils

**Reserve Requirements:**
- 1800s state governments → National Bank Act (1863) → Federal Reserve Act (1913)
- 1930s onward: counter-cyclical tool
- **1935**: Congress gave Fed authority to set requirements
- **Active use**: 1938-1951 (adjusted nine times 1949-1951), 1966-69, 1973, 1979-80
- **Volcker's anti-inflation**: October 1979 increased requirements, March 1980 to 10%, eliminated July 1980
- **1980 asset-based requirements**: unprecedented under Credit Control Act, removed August 1980
- **1990, 1992**: Fed lowered to promote credit availability

**Interest Rate Ceilings:**
- **1927**: Fed cap on interest paid by national banks to state banks
- **Banking Act of 1933**: Regulation Q imposed 3% ceiling
- **1960-1961**: Fed raised ceilings as market rates rose
- **1978**: Money market certificates with floating rate ceilings
- **March 1980**: Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act eliminated Regulation Q
- **1986**: Ceilings gradually phased out

**Supervisory Guidance:**
- **Post-WWI**: "direct pressure" to direct credit toward productive uses
- **1929**: Fed denounced speculation, stated wouldn't lend to banks extending credit for speculation
- **1947**: Urged bank caution due to excessive credit creation
- **1990s-2000s**: Multiple statements on deteriorating lending standards
- **1999**: Detailed subprime lending risks, suggested raising capital standards
- **2005**: Guidance on home equity, commercial real estate, nontraditional mortgages
- **2013**: Fed and OCC tightened regulation of leveraged loans (6x leverage limit)

**Credit Availability During Busts:**
- **April 1938**: Roosevelt asked for "more liberal bank examination policy"
- **End of S&L Crisis**: May 1990 urged senior bank officials to extend loans
- **Clinton**: New credit availability initiative, reducing "appraisal burden"
- **2007-2009**: Supervisors encouraged banks to lend and work with distressed borrowers

### Key Questions for Policy Makers
1. Where are bubbles emerging? How confident are you they are bubbles?
2. Which sectors are credit-starved? Need for differentiated policy?
3. Political costs of picking winners/losers?
4. Which policy tools — demand vs. supply, or both?
5. How to measure effectiveness?
6. Second- and third-order consequences? How to handle them?
7. Policy coordination — legislators, executive, central bank?

### Modern Structural Differences
- **UK**: Vested power in BoE and Financial Policy Committee (FPC)
- **US**: Multiple agencies coordinated through Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) post-crisis
- Biggest failures from low flexibility (interest rate caps not flexibly adapted)
