# Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk
## Peter L. Bernstein (1996)

---

## Introduction

- **Core thesis**: The revolutionary idea that defines the boundary between modern times and the past is the mastery of risk — the notion that the future is more than a whim of the gods and that humans are not passive before nature.
- Until humans crossed that boundary, the future was a mirror of the past or the murky domain of oracles and soothsayers.
- Risk management now guides decisions from allocating wealth to safeguarding public health, from waging war to planning a family, from paying insurance premiums to planting corn.
- **Risk as choice**: The word "risk" derives from the early Italian *risicare*, meaning "to dare." Risk is a choice rather than a fate.
- The modern conception of risk is rooted in the Hindu-Arabic numbering system (arrived in the West ~800 years ago), but serious study began during the Renaissance.
- **1654 turning point**: Chevalier de Mere challenged Blaise Pascal to solve the problem of dividing stakes in an unfinished game of chance (originally posed by Luca Paccioli ~200 years earlier). Pascal turned to Pierre de Fermat. Their collaboration led to the discovery of probability theory.
- **Key milestones previewed**:
  - 1703: Leibniz to Jacob Bernoulli — nature has patterns "but only for the most part" → Law of Large Numbers
  - 1730: Abraham de Moivre — normal distribution (bell curve) + standard deviation
  - 1738: Daniel Bernoulli — utility theory (satisfaction from wealth increase is inversely proportionate to existing wealth) → explains risk aversion, laid groundwork for 250 years of rational behavior theory
  - 1750s: Thomas Bayes — blending new information into old to update probability judgments
  - 1875: Francis Galton — regression to the mean
  - 1952: Harry Markowitz — diversification as the nearest to a free lunch; revolutionized Wall Street
- **Central tension**: Those who assert best decisions come from quantification/numbers vs. those who rely on subjective degrees of belief about an uncertain future. This controversy has never been resolved.
- Fischer Black: "Markets look a lot less efficient from the banks of the Hudson than from the banks of the Charles."
- Kenneth Arrow warned: knowledge "comes trailing clouds of vagueness."

## Part I: TO 1200 — BEGINNINGS

### Chapter 1: The Winds of the Greeks and the Role of the Dice

- **Central question**: Why is the mastery of risk such a uniquely modern concept? Why did humanity wait thousands of years before breaking down the barriers?
- **Gambling as the origin**: Since the beginning of recorded history, gambling has been a popular pastime. A game of chance (not a profound question about capitalism) inspired Pascal and Fermat's breakthrough into probability.
- **History of gambling**:
  - Earliest form: astragalus (knuckle-bone dice) — squarish bone from ankles of sheep/deer, virtually indestructible
  - Found in Egyptian tomb paintings from 3500 BC, Greek vases
  - "Hazard" derives from *al zahr*, Arabic word for dice
  - Card games developed from Asian fortunetelling; didn't become popular in Europe until printing was invented
  - Craps is an American invention from European dice games via Crusades
  - Poker is ~150 years old, an American variation on an older form
- **Games of chance vs. games of skill**: In pure chance games (roulette, dice, slots), odds are all you need. In skill games (poker, horse racing, backgammon), choice matters. No one makes a profession of shooting craps, but there are professional cardplayers and racetrack bettors.
- **Stock market parallel**: Many observers consider the stock market little more than a gambling casino. Is winning the result of skill + luck, or just a lucky gamble?
- **Streaks and the law of averages**: Gamblers respond asymmetrically — they invoke the law of averages to end losing streaks but hope it suspends itself during winning streaks. "Cards, coins, dice, and roulette wheels have no memory."
- **Time and risk**: Risk and time are opposite sides of the same coin — if there were no tomorrow, there would be no risk. Time transforms risk; the future is the playing field.
- **Irreversibility**: Time matters most when decisions are irreversible. "He who hesitates is halfway home" — the more uncertain the outcome, the greater the value of procrastination (optionality of waiting).
- **Why the Greeks failed to develop probability**:
  - Despite their love of gambling, skill in mathematics, mastery of logic, and obsession with proof, the Greeks never ventured into probability theory.
  - They were the only recorded civilization without a dominating priesthood claiming a monopoly on the powers of mystery.
  - Greeks placed emphasis on theory but had little interest in practical technology that would have changed views of the future.
  - They lacked a numbering system that would enable calculation (vs. just recording results).
  - "Genuflection before the winds" was their only form of risk management.
  - **Sambursky's thesis**: With their sharp distinction between truth (proved by logic/axioms) and probability ("likeness to truth"), the Greeks could not conceive of solid structure in the messy nature of day-to-day existence.
  - Greek dramas tell of helplessness before impersonal fates; they turned to oracles, not philosophers, for predictions.
  - The predictability of the heavens contrasted sharply with the behavior of "fickle, foolish gods who dwelt on high."
- **Talmudic near-miss**: The Talmud (Kethuboth 9q) contains a "double doubt" analysis that concludes there is only 1/4 (1/2 x 1/2) chance a woman committed adultery before marriage — impressive statistical sophistication, but they didn't follow up.
- **Why it took so long**: Before a society could incorporate risk, change had to come in attitudes about the *future*. Up to the Renaissance, people perceived the future as little more than luck or random variation. When survival demands consume all energy, people can't conceive of influencing outcomes.
- **Christianity's role**: The will of a single God replaced the miscellany of pagan deities — the future remained a mystery but was prescribed by a power whose intentions were clear. Yet it still wasn't susceptible to mathematical expectation.
- **The Crusades as catalyst**: By ~1000 AD, Christians sailing to new lands met Arabs who had achieved far greater intellectual sophistication. Arabs had absorbed the Hindu numbering system through their invasion of India, incorporating it into scholarship, science, and experimentation.
- **Hindu-Arabic numbers transform everything**: New methods of calculation replaced the abacus. Written computation fostered abstract thinking. Sea voyages could be longer, timekeeping more accurate, architecture more ambitious.
- **Renaissance + Protestant Reformation**: Mysticism yielded to science and logic after 1300 AD. The Reformation warned people they must walk on their own two feet and take responsibility for their decisions. The concepts of thrift and abstinence evidenced the growing importance of the future relative to the present.
- **Trade as catalyst for risk-taking**: Trade is mutually beneficial (radical idea at the time). The newly rich were the smart and adventuresome businesspeople. Capitalism required two new activities: bookkeeping (disseminated new techniques of numbering) and forecasting (links risk-taking with direct payoffs).

### Chapter 2: As Easy as I, II, III

- **Core point**: Without numbers, there are no odds and no probabilities; without those, the only way to deal with risk is to appeal to the gods and fates. Without numbers, risk is wholly a matter of gut.
- **Fibonacci (Leonardo Pisano)**: In 1202, published *Liber Abaci* (Book of the Abacus) — introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to the West. Only 27 years old; endorsed by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.
  - Fibonacci was inspired by an Arab mathematician in Bugia (Algeria) who revealed the Hindu-Arabic system.
  - *Liber Abaci* was far more than a primer — it covered fractions, square roots, higher-order roots, linear and quadratic equations, plus practical applications (bookkeeping, profit margins, money-changing, interest calculations).
- **Emperor Frederick II**: Ruled 1211-1250. Brilliant but cruel; genuinely interested in science, arts, philosophy. Destroyed private garrisons, taxed clergy, abolished tolls, shut down monopolies. Founded first European university with a royal charter (1224). Invited Fibonacci to court; Fibonacci solved algebra and cubic problems on the spot.
- **The Fibonacci sequence**: From the rabbit-breeding problem — 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233... Each number is the sum of the two preceding. After 100 months: 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 pairs.
- **The Golden Mean (1.618...)**: Divide any Fibonacci number by its predecessor → converges to 1.618 (or 0.618 going the other way). The Greeks called it "the golden mean." It defines proportions of the Parthenon, playing cards, credit cards, the UN Building, Christian crosses, flower patterns, palm tree leaf stubs, and the ratio of the human body above/below the navel.
- **Fibonacci spiral**: Series of squares with Fibonacci dimensions → rectangles with golden mean proportions → quarter-circle arcs connecting corners form a beautiful spiral.

### Chapter 2: As Easy as I, II, III (continued)

- **Pre-number history**: Neanderthals could tally (marks on stone/log) but had little need. Systematic measurement began ~10,000 years ago when humans settled in river valleys (Tigris, Euphrates, Nile, Indus, Yangtse). Rivers became highways; travelers needed precise computation for navigation, calendar time, geography.
- **Priests were the first astronomers** — from astronomy came mathematics. People grouped numbers into tens or twenties (fingers and toes).
- **Egyptian limitations**: Expert astronomers who predicted Nile floods, but managing/influencing the future never entered their minds. Mental processes dominated by habit, seasonality, and respect for the past.
- **Greek alphabetic numbering** (~450 BC): Used 27 letters for numbers 1-9, 10-90, 100-900. "Pi" comes from "penta" (5). Hebrews used a similar cipher-alphabet system. Major limitation: you could barely do arithmetic with letters — they were just recording devices, with the abacus doing the actual computation.
- **The Greek spirit of proof**: "Why?" mattered more than "What?" They were the first civilization free of an all-powerful priesthood's intellectual straitjacket. They sought universal concepts, not just samples. Proof, not calculation, would dominate mathematics forever after.
- **Yet the Greeks failed at probability and algebra** — perhaps because their clumsy letter-based numbering system made calculations impossible. Romans had the same handicap (IX for 9; III II could mean 32 or 302 or 3020).
- **Hindu numbering system** (~500 AD): Who contrived this miraculous invention remains a mystery. Arabs encountered it ~90 years after Mohammed (622 AD), when Islam swept into India.
- **Baghdad as intellectual hub**: Already a great center of learning. The Caliph retained Jewish scholars to translate Ptolemy and Euclid. Major mathematical works circulated throughout the Arab empire by the 9th-10th centuries.
- **Diophantus** (~250 AD, Alexandria): Suggested using true numbers instead of letters. Pioneered symbolic algebra. But couldn't conceive of negative numbers (called 4 = 4x + 20 "absurd") because he lacked the concept of zero. His work was ignored for 1,500 years but became central to the flowering of algebra in the 17th century. Algebraic equations like a + bx = c are called Diophantine equations.
- **The invention of zero**: Called *sunya* by Indians, *cifr* in Arabic → our word "cipher." Zero meant: (1) only ten digits needed for any conceivable calculation; (2) place-value became visible and clear (1, 10, 100, 1000...). Zero "blew out the limits to ideas and to progress."
- **Al-Khowarizmi** (~825 AD): First to establish rules for +, -, ×, ÷ with Hindu numerals. His name gives us "algorithm." His *Hisab al-jabr w'almugabalah* ("Science of transposition and cancellation") gives us "algebra."
- **Omar Khayyam** (~1050-1130): Author of the Rubaiyat, but also a major mathematician. Used the new numbering system to develop a language of calculation beyond al-Khowarizmi. Reformed the calendar. Devised a triangular rearrangement of numbers (squares, cubes, higher powers) that formed the basis of concepts later developed by Blaise Pascal.
- **Why Arabs didn't develop probability**: Despite advanced mathematics, their fatalistic view of life — "Who determines our future: the fates, the gods, or ourselves?" — prevented the leap. Risk management emerges only when people believe they are to some degree free agents.
- **Resistance to Hindu-Arabic numbers**: Despite Fibonacci and Emperor Frederick's patronage, bitter resistance persisted until the early 1500s. Two reasons: (1) inertia — centuries of established practice; (2) fraud — easy to alter 0→6/9, 1→4/6/7/9 (one reason Europeans write 7 as 7̸). Florence banned "infidel symbols" from banking in 1229; people disguised themselves as Muslims to learn the new system.
- **Printing press (~1450)** finally overcame opposition. Fraudulent alterations became impossible in print. Roman numeral absurdities became obvious. Multiplication tables became universal. Gambling took on a whole new dimension.
- **Diophantus puzzle answer**: x = x/6 + x/12 + x/7 + 5 + x/2 + 4 → Diophantus lived to be 84.

## Part II: 1200-1700 — A THOUSAND OUTSTANDING FACTS

### Chapter 3: The Renaissance Gambler

- **Piero della Francesca** (1420-1492): His "Brera Madonna" epitomizes the break between the Renaissance and the Middle Ages. Figures are human beings — no halos, standing solidly on the ground, three-dimensional, not paying attention to the Virgin. Greek philosophy inverted: mystery is now in the heavens, while on earth men and women are free-standing human beings.
- **Renaissance context**: Columbus, Copernicus, printing press (~1450), mathematics translated into Italian/vernacular. Mathematicians held public debates over algebraic equations while crowds cheered.
- **Luca Paccioli** (1445-1509): Franciscan monk, born in Piero della Francesca's hometown. Published *Summa de arithmetica, geometria et proportionalita* (1494) — set out basic algebra, multiplication tables up to 60×60, and (most durably) the most extensive treatment of double-entry bookkeeping to date.
  - Double-entry bookkeeping: "had significant economic consequences comparable to the discovery of the steam engine three hundred years later."
  - Close friend of Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo had little formal math knowledge before meeting Paccioli; Paccioli "provided the stimulus for a sudden transformation in Leonardo's mathematical ambitions." Leonardo supplied drawings for Paccioli's *De Divine Proportione*.
  - Leonardo admonished himself to "learn the multiplication of the roots from master Luca." A Renaissance genius could barely pass third-grade arithmetic — revealing commentary on the state of mathematical understanding in the late 1400s.
- **The Problem of the Points**: Paccioli posed it in the Summa — A and B play a fair game to 6 rounds; the game stops when A has won 5 and B has won 3. How should the stakes be divided? This brain-teaser appears repeatedly in 16th-17th century writings. Its resolution marked the beginning of systematic probability analysis.
- **Why Greeks/Romans didn't figure the odds**: Despite knowing six-sided dice, being familiar with astragali (oblong bones, 4 faces — 2 narrow, 2 wide), and Aristotle noting that repeating a dice throw 10,000 times would be impossible — they never sat down to figure the odds. They had little interest in experimentation; theory and proof were all that mattered. "Precision was the monopoly of the gods."
- **Girolamo Cardano** (1500-1571): The quintessential Renaissance man and first person to write a serious analysis of games of chance.
  - Born in Milan, contemporary of Benvenuto Cellini. Autobiography: *De Vita Propria Liber* ("The Book of My Life").
  - Compulsive gambler: "immoderate devotion to table games and dice... I have played not off and on but, as I am ashamed to say, every day." Played everything from dice to chess. Qualified his probability calculations with "if the die is honest" — but concluded "The greatest advantage from gambling comes from not playing it at all."
  - Far more than a gambler: most famous physician of his age (Pope and European royalty sought his counsel). First clinical description of typhus symptoms. Wrote about syphilis. Developed new hernia surgery. Early advocate of bathing and showering.
  - Prolific writer: 131 printed works, burned 170 more, left 111 in manuscript. Best seller: *De Subtilitate Rerum* ("On the Subtlety of Things") — 6 editions.
  - Two sons who brought him misery. Giambattista married a disreputable, unfaithful girl;

### Chapter 3: The Renaissance Gambler (continued)

- **Cardano's sons' fate**: Giambattista married an unfaithful woman, poisoned her with arsenic, confessed, and was beheaded. Younger son Aldo robbed his father and went in and out of jail at least eight times.
- **Lodovico Ferrari**: Cardano's brilliant protege, "Cardano's Creation." Argued Cardano's cases in mathematical confrontations. Some believe Ferrari was responsible for many ideas credited to Cardano. Died at 43 from poisoning.
- **Ars Magna (1545)**: First major Renaissance work on algebra. Published same time as Copernicus. Introduced the use of a, b, c in algebra. Solved cubic and quadratic equations, wrestled with square roots of negative numbers. Yet Cardano failed to solve Paccioli's problem of the points.
- **Liber de Ludo Aleae (Book on Games of Chance)**: First serious effort to develop statistical principles of probability. Written ~1525, rewritten 1565, published posthumously 1663.
  - The word "probability" doesn't appear; Cardano uses "chances." Latin root of probability = *probare* (to test, to prove, to approve) → "worthy of approbation."
  - **Dual meaning of probability** (per philosopher Ian Hacking): (1) epistemological — degree of belief/approvability of an opinion; (2) frequentist — measuring observed frequencies. The older sense (approbation) evolved into the newer sense (measurable frequency).
  - Galileo: Copernican theory was "improbable" (didn't meet with approval). Leibniz later called it "incomparably the most probable" (supported by evidence).
  - German word *wahrscheinlich* = "with the appearance of truth."
- **Cardano's key contribution — defining probability as a fraction**: favorable outcomes / total possible outcomes ("circuit"). Example: coin flip = 1/2; queen from deck = 4/52 = 1/13.
  - Single die: probability of any one number = 1/6. Probability of 1 or 2 = 2/6 = 1/3.
  - Successive throws: P(1 or 2 twice in a row) = 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/9. Three times = 1/27.
  - **Two dice — the crucial insight**: Two dice don't have 12 possible outcomes but 36 combinations (6×6). A 3+4 is different from 4+3. This recognition of combinations was "the most important step he took in developing the laws of probability."
  - **Craps probability table**: 7 is the easiest to throw (6/36 = 1/6), because there are 6 combinations (6+1, 5+2, 4+3, 3+4, 2+5, 1+6). Snake eyes and box cars each = 1/36.
  - **Backgammon**: Numbers on each die can be added together OR considered separately, so a 5 can appear 15 different ways out of 36 = ~42%.
- **Probability vs. odds**: Probability = favorable/total. Odds = favorable/unfavorable. If P(five-throw in backgammon) = 15/36, odds are 15 to 21. If P(7 in craps) = 1/6, odds on throwing NOT-7 are 5 to 1. You should bet no more than $1 on 7 when the other fellow bets $5.
  - Horse racing: if odds on every horse converted to probabilities sum > 100%, the difference is the track/state's cut.
- **Cardano's legacy**: *Liber de Ludo Aleae* is "the first known effort to put measurement at the service of risk." Began experimental, ended theoretical (combinations). A monumental achievement.
- **The real hero is the times**: The opportunity to discover probability existed for thousands of years. The missing ingredients — freedom of thought, passion for experimentation, desire to control the future — were unleashed during the Renaissance.
- **Galileo (1564-1642)**: Born same year as Shakespeare. Liked to experiment; used his pulse rate to measure time. In 1583, discovered the pendulum principle (swaying lamp in Pisa cathedral) → revolutionized clockmaking.
  - Wrote *Sopra le Scoperte dei Dadi* (On Playing Dice) reluctantly — a disagreeable chore to improve his employer's (Grand Duke of Tuscany) gambling scores. Retraced much of Cardano's work. By 1623, the aleatory concept was so established Galileo felt there was little more to discover.
- **After Cardano/Galileo**: Ideas about probability spread through France, Switzerland, Germany, England. France became the scene of explosive mathematical innovation in the 17th-18th centuries — calculus, algebra → increasingly abstract concepts that provided foundations for practical applications (insurance, medicine, heredity, war, weather forecasting).
- **Thomas Gataker (1619)**: Puritan minister who argued that natural law, not divine law, determined games of chance — an important intellectual shift.

### Chapter 4: The French Connection

- **Neither Cardano nor Galileo realized they were on the verge of inventing the most powerful tool of risk management**: the laws of probability. Cardano was interested in a theory of gambling, not of probability. Galileo wasn't even interested in a theory of gambling.
- **1642 — Galileo dies. 1654 — three Frenchmen make the great leap**: Pascal, Fermat, and the Chevalier de Mere.
- **Post-Galileo rapid developments**: Huygens published a probability textbook (1657, noted by Newton in 1664). Leibniz explored applying probability to legal problems. Port-Royal monastery produced *Logic* (1662). John Graunt (1660) generalized demographic data from church mortality records. Dutch towns put annuities on sound actuarial footing. By 1700, England financed budget deficits through life annuities.
- **The three Frenchmen**:
  - **Blaise Pascal** (1623-1662): Brilliant young dissolute who became a religious zealot. Born 1623, the year Galileo finished his dice essay. Life torn between mathematics and anti-intellectual Jansenist religious convictions.
    - Child prodigy: discovered most of Euclidean geometry by drawing on playroom tiles. At 16, wrote a paper on the cone so advanced Descartes was impressed.
    - Father was a tax farmer (advanced money to the monarch, then collected taxes). Young Pascal invented and patented a calculating machine for his father's accounts — gears and wheels, precursor to electronic calculators.
    - At 14, introduced to Abbe Mersenne's weekly discussion group — the center of European science (precursor to Academie des Sciences and Royal Society).
    - 1646: father broke hip; Jansenist bonesetters converted the whole family. Pascal abandoned math, science, and pleasure for extreme religion. "The eternal silence of these infinite spaces leaves me in terror."
    - 1650: at 27, broke down — partial paralysis, difficulty swallowing, severe headaches. Doctors told him to resume pleasure-seeking. He did, with gusto — exceeded earlier indulgences, became a regular at Paris gambling tables.
    - Proved existence of vacuums (controversial since Aristotle declared "nature abhors a vacuum"). Demonstrated barometric pressure with mercury tubes.
  - **Chevalier de Mere**: Nobleman who combined taste for mathematics with an irresistible urge to gamble. Boasted to Pascal of mathematical discoveries. Leibniz described him as "a man of penetrating mind who was both a gambler and a philosopher."
    - De Mere's edge: knew P(throwing a 6 with one die) rises above 50% with 4 throws (to 51.77%). Strategy: win tiny amounts on many throws instead of betting large on few.
    - **The sonnez disaster**: Tried the same trick with double-six on two dice in 24 throws. Lost consistently. The actual probability was 49.14% on 24 throws — he needed 25 throws for >50% (50.55%). "The history of risk management is written in red as well as in black."
  - **Pierre de Fermat** (1601-1665): Lawyer in Toulouse for whom mathematics was a sideline. Spoke all principal European languages, wrote poetry, commented on Greek/Roman literature. Rare mathematical power: independent inventor of analytical geometry, contributed to early calculus, researched weight of the earth, light refraction, optics.
    - **Number theory**: his crowning achievement. Perfect numbers (6 = 1+2+3), amicable numbers (220 and 284), prime number formulas.
    - **Fermat's Last Theorem**: Scribbled in margin of his copy of Diophantus's *Arithmetic*: a² + b² = c² works (Pythagoras), but a³ + b³ = c³ would not, nor any integer power higher than 2. "I have a truly marvelous demonstration which this margin is too narrow to contain." Stumped mathematicians for 350+ years until Andrew Wiles (1993-1995).
- **The 1654 correspondence**: Pascal contacted Fermat (via Pierre de Carcavi of Mersenne's group) about the problem of the points. This exchange was "an epochal event in the history of mathematics and the theory of probability."
  - They constructed a systematic method for analyzing future outcomes. When more things *can* happen than *will* happen, they gave a procedure for determining the likelihood of each possible result.
  - Fermat used pure algebra. Pascal used a geometric format — Pascal's Triangle.
- **Pascal's Triangle** (known earlier to Omar Khayyam ~1100 and Chu Shih-chieh in China, 1303):
  ```
         1
        1 1
       1 2 1
      1 3 3 1
     1 4 6 4 1
    1 5 10 10 5 1
   1 6 15 20 15 6 1
  ```
  Each number = sum of two numbers above it. Rows enumerate combinations for probability analysis.
  - Row 2 (1, 1): 50-50 situation (boy or girl, heads or tails). Total = 2.
  - Row 3 (1, 2, 1): 2 children — 1 chance both boys, 2 chances one of each, 1 chance both girls. Total = 4.
  - Row 7 (1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1): 6 games — total 64 possible sequences.
- **Solving the problem of the points (World Series example)**: Your team has lost Game 1; what's the probability of winning 4 of the remaining 6 games?
  - Look at row 7: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 (64 total combinations).
  - Your team needs 4 wins in 6 games. Combinations where you win 4+: 1 + 6 + 15 = 22 out of 64 = ~34.4% (a tad better than 1 in 3).
  - The opposing team's combinations: 42 out of 64.
  - Note: some sequences end before all 6 games are played (e.g., winning 4 straight), but Pascal argued "the mathematical laws must dominate" — you must count all theoretical combinations for the math to work.
- **Mutual admiration**: Fermat wrote to Carcavi: "I believe [Pascal] capable of solving any problem." Pascal to Fermat: "your numerical arrangements are far beyond my comprehension... a man so outstanding in intellect... supreme among the geomasters of Europe."

### Chapter 4 (continued): Morality, the Wager, and Forecasting

- **Pascal's moral framing**: More than mathematics was involved — Pascal was deeply involved with religion and morality, Fermat was a jurist. According to their solutions, there is a matter of **moral right** in dividing stakes of an unfinished game.
  - Pascal: "The first thing which we must consider is that the money the players have put into the game no longer belongs to them... but they have received in return the right to expect that which luck will bring them, according to the rules upon which they agreed at the outset."
  - This is the "just distribution" — the principles of probability theory determine the division *because they determine the just distribution of the stakes*.
  - **Risk management connection**: The Pascal-Fermat solution is clearly colored by the notion of risk management. "Only the foolhardy take risks when the rules are unclear."
- **Generalizing beyond two players**: Their solutions extended to cases with more than two players, two teams, two genders, two dice, or coins with two sides — far beyond Cardano's combinations.
- **Pascal's mystical break**: Last letter of the series dated October 27, 1654. Less than a month later, Pascal had a mystical experience. He sewed a description into his coat to wear next to his heart: "Renunciation, total and sweet." Abandoned mathematics and physics, sold all possessions except religious books, took residence at the monastery of Port-Royal in Paris.
  - Yet traces of the old Pascal lingered: he established the first commercial bus line in Paris, profits going to Port-Royal.
  - 1660: Pascal took a trip near Fermat's residence. Fermat proposed a meeting but Pascal declined, citing bad health. Pascal wrote in August: "I can scarcely remember that there is such a thing as Geometry... I can find little difference between a man who is a geometrician and a clever craftsman."
- **Pascal's Wager** (*le pari de Pascal*): In his *Pensees*, Pascal framed the question of God's existence as a game of chance.
  - "God is, or he is not. Which way should we incline? Reason cannot answer."
  - Ian Hacking calls this **the beginning of decision theory** — "the theory of deciding what to do when it is uncertain what will happen."
  - Pascal's logic: We cannot prove God's existence experimentally. Our only alternative is to explore the future consequences of believing vs. rejecting. We are forced to play this game by the mere act of living.
  - The decision is not whether to *believe* but whether to *act in a manner that leads to believing* — living with pious people, following holy water and sacraments.
  - **Key insight**: The value of the outcome and the likelihood that it may occur will differ because the **consequences of the two outcomes are different**.
  - If God is not, whether you live piously or sinfully is immaterial. But if God *is*, then betting against His existence risks eternal damnation, while betting for Him offers the possibility of salvation. Since salvation is clearly preferable to damnation, the correct decision is to act on the basis that God is.
- **Port-Royal Logic** (*La logique, ou l'art de penser*, 1662): A group at Port-Royal published this influential work, running to five editions by 1668. Primary (not sole) author: Antoine Arnauld, "perhaps the most brilliant theologian of his time." Translated throughout Europe, still in use as a textbook in the 19th century.
  - Last four chapters cover probability — developing a hypothesis from limited facts (**statistical inference**), rules for accepting human authority, interpreting miracles, interpreting historical events, and applying numerical measures to probability.
  - **First measurement of probability in print**: A game where 10 players risk one coin each to win the other nine. "There are nine degrees of probability of losing a coin for only one of gaining nine." (Hacking calls this the first time probability "is measured" in print.)
  - **Fear of harm**: "Fear of harm ought to be proportional not merely to the gravity of the harm, but also to the probability of the event." This is the idea that **both gravity and probability should influence a decision** — the concept that came to be known as **utility**.
- **Near-miss of forecasting**: Pascal's Triangle can predict the probable number of boys or girls in a multi-child family, or the probable outcome of a World Series after part has been played. Pascal and Fermat were essentially **forecasting** — holding a systematic method for calculating the probabilities of future events. But the significance for business management, insurance, and economic forecasting was "too remote for Pascal and Fermat to have recognized what they were missing. It is only with hindsight that we can see how close they came."
- After 1654, mumbo jumbo would no longer be the forecasting method of choice.

### Chapter 5: The Remarkable Notions of the Remarkable Notions Man

- **Core theme**: We all make decisions on the basis of limited data — sampling. One sip of wine tells you if the whole bottle is drinkable. A few drops of blood reveal DNA patterns. Pollsters interview 2,000 to gauge a nation's mood. The Dow Jones consists of just 30 stocks but measures trillions in wealth.
- **Sampling is essential to risk-taking**: We constantly use samples of the present and past to guess about the future. But how reliable is the average? How representative is the sample? "What is 'normal,' anyway?"
- **Trial of the Pyx** (earliest formal sampling): Established by 1279 under Edward I of England. Coins randomly selected from the Royal Mint output were compared to a gold plate standard stored at the Chapel of the Pyx in Westminster Abbey. The procedure **permitted a specifically defined variance from the standard** — acknowledging that not every coin could match exactly.
- **John Graunt (1620-1674)** and *Natural and Political Observations made upon the Bills of Mortality* (1662):
  - Published 8 years after the Pascal-Fermat correspondence (and the year Pascal "finally discovered for himself whether God is or God is not").
  - **A stunning breakthrough**: "a daring leap into the use of sampling methods and the calculation of probabilities — the raw material of every method of risk management, from insurance to environmental risks to derivatives."
  - **Background**: Graunt was not a statistician, demographer, mathematician, actuary, scientist, or politician — he was a 42-year-old merchant of "notions" (buttons and needles).
  - A keen businessman who made enough money to pursue intellectual interests. John Aubrey described him as "a very ingenious and studious person... [who] rose early in the morning to his Study before shoptime... Very facetious and fluent in his conversation."
  - **William Petty**: Close friend who helped with statistical complexities. Petty was a remarkable polymath — physician, Surveyor of Ireland, Professor of Anatomy and Music, war profiteer, and author of *Political Arithmetick* (earning him the title "founder of modern economics").
  - **Royal Society admission**: Graunt's work attracted Charles II's notice, who proposed him for the newly formed Royal Society. Members balked at admitting "a mere tradesman," but the King advised: "if they found any more such Tradesmen, they should be sure to admit them all." Graunt made the grade.
  - **The Royal Society** originated from John Wilkins (1617-1672), who formed a club of brilliant minds at Wadham College — a clone of Mersenne's Paris group. Wilkins later became Bishop of Chichester; he also wrote science fiction and designed submarines for the Arctic.
- **Graunt's motivations and methods**:
  - Found "much pleasure in deducing so many abstruse, and unexpected inferences out of these poor despised Bills of Mortality."
  - **Serious objective**: "[T]o know how many people there be of each Sex, State, Age, Religious, Trade, Rank, or Degree, &c. by the knowing whereof Trade and Government may be made more certain, and Regular."
  - May have invented the concept of **market research** and gave the government its first estimate of people available for military service.
  - **Data sources**: London Bills of Mortality (weekly tallies from 1603), parish records, Dutch life annuity records, French church records.
  - Hacking notes that Graunt and Petty had no knowledge of Pascal or Huygens, but "whether motivated by God, or by gaming, or by commerce, or by the law, the same kind of ideas emerged simultaneously in many minds."
  - Graunt was hardly aware he was innovating **sampling theory** — he worked with the complete bills rather than a sample. But he "reasoned systematically about raw data in ways that no one had ever tried before," laying the foundation for statistics (from analysis of quantitative facts about the state).
- **Historical context**: England transforming from agricultural to commercial society. Taxation shifting from land to population-based. Charles II recalled from Holland in 1660 (Restoration). Colonial wealth arriving. Newton (age 28) reshaping science. Charles II was a "Merry Monarch" — "It was time to stand up and look around. John Graunt did, and began counting."
- **Graunt's key findings from the Bills of Mortality**:
  - **Plague statistics**: 1603 was worst — 82% of burials were plague victims. From 1604-1624, 229,250 total deaths from all causes, about a third from children's diseases.
  - **Childhood mortality**: ~36% of all conceptions died before age 6.
  - **Causes of death** (1632): ~60 different causes listed, 628 deaths under "aged." Others ranged from "affrighted" and "bit with mad dog" to "quinsie" and "starved at nurse." Only 7 murders and 15 suicides.
  - **Disease patterns**: Prevalence of acute/epidemic diseases "might give a measure of the state, and disposition of this Climate, and Air... as well as its food."
  - **Beggars**: Few starved; they were "most of them healthy and strong." Recommended the state "keep" them and teach them work.
  - **Syphilis** (the "French-Pox"): Records showed few dying of it, but Graunt deduced most deaths from ulcers and sores were actually venereal disease with euphemistic diagnoses. Authorities only acknowledged the true cause for "onely hated persons, and such, whose very Noses were eaten of."
  - **Data limitations**: Medical diagnosis was uncertain ("the wisest person in the parish would be able to find out very few distempers from a bare inspection of the dead body"). Only Church of England christenings were tabulated — Dissenters and Catholics excluded.
- **Graunt's analytical achievements**:
  - **Population estimation**: Made the first reasoned estimate of London's population.
    - *Method 1*: 12,000 births/year × 2 = 24,000 "teeming women" × 2 (non-childbearing households) = 48,000 families × 8 members = **384,000 people** (vs. the common belief of 2 million).
    - *Method 2*: From a 1658 map, estimated 54 families per 100 sq yards within the walls = 11,880 families inside. Bills showed 3,200 of 13,000 deaths inside walls (ratio 1:4). So 4 × 11,880 = 47,520 families total. (Suspiciously close to Method 1 — may have worked backwards.)
  - **Proto-probability thinking**: Didn't use the word "probability" but echoed Port-Royal Logic on irrational fears: "Whereas many persons live in great fear and apprehension of some of the more formidable and notorious diseases, I shall set down how many died of each... that those persons may the better understand the hazard they are in."
  - **Life expectancy / life table**: Guessing most people die before 75, and using his "36% die before age 6" estimate, Graunt created a **survival table** from a group of 100:
    | Age | Graunt | US 1993 |
    |-----|--------|---------|
    | 0   | 100    | 100     |
    | 6   | 64     | 99      |
    | 16  | 40     | 99      |
    | 26  | 25     | 98      |
    | 36  | 16     | 97      |
    | 46  | 10     | 95      |
    | 56  | 6      | 92      |
    | 66  | 3      | 84      |
    | 76  | 1      | 70      |
  - The estimates were "good guesses" — they inspired Petty's insistence on a central statistical office. Petty estimated life expectancy at birth = 18 years; Graunt's estimate was 16.
  - **Legacy**: "The facts Graunt assembled changed people's perceptions of what the country they lived in was really like." He set forth the research agenda for the country's social problems.
  - Graunt's work suggested the key concepts for decision-making under uncertainty: **sampling, averages, and notions of what is normal**.

### Chapter 5 (continued): Edmund Halley and the Breslaw Data

- **~30 years after Graunt**, Edmund Halley produced a work similar to Graunt's but "even more important to the history of risk management." Halley was familiar with Graunt's work and carried the analysis further. Without Graunt's first effort, the idea might never have occurred to Halley.
- **Halley's background**: English astronomer of high repute. Used data from **Breslaw** (Breslau, Silesia — now Wroclaw, Poland), which had long-standing meticulous birth and death records.
  - 1690: Local clergyman Caspar Naumann went through the Breslaw records to disprove superstitions about the moon and "climacteric years" affecting health. Sent results to Leibniz, who forwarded them to the Royal Society.
  - Halley was only 35, but already one of England's most distinguished astronomers. He had persuaded Newton to publish the *Principia* (1684), paying all publication costs himself and correcting page proofs. Historian James Newman conjectures the *Principia* might never have appeared without Halley.
  - **Career**: Child prodigy in astronomy — carried a 24-inch telescope to Oxford as an undergraduate at Queen's College. Left without a degree to study the southern hemisphere; established his reputation before age 20. Royal Society member at 22. Oxford denied him a professorship in 1691 for "materialistic views" but relented in 1703. Became Royal Astronomer at Greenwich in 1721. Lived to 86 — "a jolly man, with an uncommon degree of sprightliness and vivacity."
  - **Halley's Comet**: In 1705, identified 24 comets between 1337-1698. Three seemed identical — appeared in 1531, 1607, 1682. Predicted the comet's return; it arrived on schedule in 1758, electrifying the world. Celebrated every 76 years since.
- **Breslaw vs. London data**: Halley saw flaws in Graunt's work (which Graunt himself had acknowledged). London data lacked ages at death and reliable total population figures due to constant migration.
  - The Breslaw data (1687-1691) included age and sex for all deaths plus annual births — "seeming to be done with all the Exactness and Sincerity possible."

### Chapter 5 (continued): Halley's Analysis of the Breslaw Data

- **Breslaw's advantages over London**: Far from the sea, so "the Confluence of Strangers is but small." Births exceeded funerals by only a small amount, and the population was much more stable than London's. Halley was convinced the figures were sufficiently accurate for a reliable total population estimate.
- **Halley's calculations**:
  - Average of 1,238 births and 1,174 deaths per year over the five-year period; the annual excess of ~64 was "may perhaps be balanced by the Levies for the Emperor's Service in his Wars."
  - Directing attention to the 1,238 annual births and examining age distribution of deaths, calculated that "but 692 of the Persons born do survive Six whole Years" — a much smaller proportion than Graunt's estimate of 64%.
  - About a dozen deaths occurred between ages 81-100.
  - Worked back from the age distribution of deaths to a grand estimate of **34,000** for the town's total population.
- **Halley's life table**: Broke population into an age distribution "from birth to extream Old Age." Offered "manifold uses" and "a more just Idea of the State and condition of Mankind, than any thing yet extant."
  - **Practical applications**: Estimated military-age men at 9/34ths of population — a "Rule for other places."
  - **Probability of survival**: Table showed the odds that "a Party of any given age does not die in a Year." Example: 25-year age group numbered 567, while 26-year group numbered 560. Difference of 7 meant probability of a 25-year-old dying in any one year = 7/567, or odds of 80-to-1 of making it to 26.
  - **Life expectancy**: For 531 people aged 30, half that number = 265. Looking for the age group numbering 265 → between 57 and 58. Hence, "an even Wager that... a Man of 30 may reasonably expect to live between 27 and 28 years."
  - **Odds of reaching specific ages**: A man of 40 could expect to live to 47, at odds of 5½-to-1.
- **Insurance pricing**: The most important level of Halley's analysis — the table could be used "to reckon the price of insuring lives at different ages." Odds of a 20-year-old not dying in a year = 100 to 1; for a 50-year-old = 38 to 1. The table furnished the necessary information for calculating the value of **annuities**, including those covering two and three lives.
- **Historical context of annuities**: First record dates to 225 AD — Roman jurist **Ulpian** developed an authoritative set of life expectancy tables. Ulpian's tables were the last word for over 1,400 years!
  - The English government tried to raise a million pounds by selling annuities that repaid the purchase price over 14 years — **at the same price for everyone, regardless of age**! This was extremely costly for the government. Yet this policy continued until 1789.
  - In 1540, annuities repaid in just 7 years with no age adjustment.
- **Halley's lasting impact**: After publication of his life tables in *Transactions* (1693), a century would pass before governments and insurance companies actually used probability-based life expectancies. But Halley's manipulation of simple numbers formed the basis on which the life-insurance industry built its database.

### Chapter 5 (continued): Lloyd's of London and the Rise of Insurance

- **Coffee and risk**: In 1637, a Cretan scholar named Canopius made the first cup of coffee ever drunk in England at Balliol College, Oxford. Coffee houses soon spread all over London.
  - A coffee house was the birthplace of **Lloyd's of London** — for more than two centuries the most famous of all insurance companies.
  - Insurance is "totally dependent on the process of sampling, averages, independence of observations, and the notion of normal" — the same concepts Graunt and Halley researched. The rapid development of insurance alongside their publications was no coincidence.
- **The commercial context**: "Stockbroker-stock jobber" first appeared ~1688, a hundred years before Wall Street. Corporations with curious names (Lute-String Company, Tapestry Company, Diving Company) suddenly appeared. Ships arrived daily from colonies with sugar, spice, coffee, tea, cotton, porcelain. "Wealth was no longer something that had to be inherited... now it could be earned, discovered, accumulated, invested — and protected from loss."
  - England had to finance costly wars with France (1692-1713). On December 15, 1693, the House of Commons established the English national debt with the million-pound annuity issue. Macaulay called this "the origin of that debt which has since become the greatest prodigy that ever perplexed the sagacity and confounded the pride of statesmen and philosophers."
- **Coffee houses as information hubs**: In the absence of mass media, coffee houses were the primary source of news and rumor. Charles II shut them down in 1675, but "the uproar was so great that he had to reverse himself sixteen days later." Samuel Pepys got shipping news there that was more reliable than what he learned at the Admiralty.
- **Edward Lloyd's coffee house** (1687, Tower Street near the Thames): Favorite haunt of men from the ships at London's docks.
  - "Spacious... wellbuilt and inhabited by able tradesmen." Moved to larger quarters on Lombard Street in 1691. Staff of five served tea, sherbet, and coffee.
  - Lloyd launched **"Lloyd's List"** in 1696 — arrivals, departures, and intelligence on ships and conditions at sea. Network of correspondents in major ports. Ship auctions on premises. A corner reserved for captains to compare notes on new routes. Open almost 24/7, always crowded.
  - Lloyd's List eventually expanded to cover stock prices, foreign markets, and high-water times at London Bridge. So well known that correspondents addressed post simply to "Lloyd's." The government used it to publish news of battles at sea.
- **The underwriting business**: Anyone seeking insurance went to a broker, who approached individual risk-takers at the coffee houses or Royal Exchange. Risk-takers confirmed agreements by writing their name under the contract terms → hence **"underwriters."**
  - Underwriters would insure against almost anything: "house-breaking, highway robbery, death by gin-drinking, the death of horses, and 'assurance of female chastity' — of which all but the last are still insurable."
  - Fire insurance demand expanded rapidly after the Great Fire of London (1666).
- **Lloyd's as marine insurance HQ**: Excellent mercantile/shipping connections. Lloyd's List became the authoritative source.
  - 1720: King George I (bribed with £300,000) granted monopoly to Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and London Assurance Corporation — "exclusive of all other corporations and societies." But private individuals could still underwrite. The corporations struggled to recruit experienced underwriters.
  - **1771**: 79 underwriters formed the **Society of Lloyd's**, each subscribing £100. These "Names" committed all their worldly possessions and financial capital to secure their promise to cover losses. This personal commitment fueled Lloyd's rapid growth. "And thus did Canopius's cup of coffee lead to the establishment of the most famous insurance company in history."
- **American insurance**: By the 1770s, an industry emerged in the colonies. Benjamin Franklin set up a fire-insurance company called First American (1752). First life insurance was by the Presbyterian Ministers' Fund (1759). After the Revolution, Americans formed their own companies; the first stockholder-owned insurer was the Insurance Company of North America in Philadelphia.
- **Ancient roots of insurance**:
  - **Code of Hammurabi** (~1800 BC): 282 clauses on "bottomry" — a loan/mortgage taken by a ship owner to finance a voyage. No premium as we know it was paid. If the ship was lost, the loan didn't have to be repaid. (Still in use up to the Roman era.)
  - **Emperor Claudius** (10 BC-AD 54): Made himself a one-man, premium-free insurance company, taking personal responsibility for storm losses to Roman corn merchants — similar to modern government disaster aid.
  - **Greek and Roman guilds**: Cooperatives whose members pooled money to care for families if the head of household died prematurely — "friendly societies" that persisted into Lloyd's era.
  - **Medieval growth**: Major financial centers in Amsterdam, Augsburg, Antwerp, Frankfurt, Lyons, Venice. Bruges established a Chamber of Assurance in 1310. Bills of exchange facilitated money transfers.
  - **Diversification**: Merchants learned early to spread risk. Shakespeare's Antonio: "My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, / Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate / Upon the fortune of this present year; / Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad."
  - **Agricultural insurance**: Italian farmers insured each other against bad weather — good-weather farmers compensated bad-weather farmers. Monte del Paschi (Siena, 1473) served as intermediary. Similar arrangements exist in developing countries today.
  - **Insurance = gambling**: Insurance companies use premiums from the loss-free to pay those who have suffered losses — the same as casinos paying winners from losers' pot.
  - **Francesco di Marco Datini** (Florentine merchant): Complained about his underwriters to his wife: "For whom they insure, it is sweet to them to take the monies; but when disaster comes, it is otherwise, and each man draws his rump back and strives not to pay." He left 400 marine insurance policies in his estate.
  - The term "policy" (from Italian *polizza*, a promise) was in general use by 1600. Francis Bacon introduced a bill in Parliament in 1601 to regulate insurance policies.
- **Forecasting becomes essential**: Profit on goods shipped long distances depended on weather, consumer needs, pricing, fashions, and financing costs. "Forecasting — long denigrated as a waste of time at best and a sin at worst — became an absolute necessity in the course of the seventeenth century."
  - The development of business forecasting was a major innovation. As long as mathematicians excluded commercial applications, advances toward a science of risk management had to wait.
  - Even Halley's life table calculations were to him "only a sociological study or a game with arithmetic played out for the amusement of his scientific colleagues."
  - **The conceptual hurdle ahead**: Shifting from identifying mathematical odds to estimating the probability of uncertain outcomes — from collecting data to deciding what to do with it. "The intellectual advances from this point forward are in many ways more astonishing than the advances we have witnessed so far."

## Part III: 1700-1900 — MEASUREMENT UNLIMITED

### Chapter 6: Considering the Nature of Man

- **Transition**: In just a few years, the mathematical achievements of Cardano and Pascal had been elevated into domains neither had dreamed of. Graunt, Petty, and Halley applied probability to raw data analysis. The Port-Royal Logic blended measurement and subjective beliefs: "Fear of harm ought to be proportional not merely to the gravity of the harm, but also to the probability of the event."
- **1738 St. Petersburg paper**: The Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences carried an essay with the central theme: **"the value of an item must not be based on its price, but rather on the utility that it yields."** Originally presented to the Academy in 1731 as *Specimen Theoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis* (Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk).
- **Two inseparable elements of risk**: Both the Port-Royal Logic and the 1738 paper build on the proposition that any decision relating to risk involves **two distinct and yet inseparable elements**: (1) the objective facts; (2) a subjective view about the desirability of what is to be gained or lost.
  - Port-Royal: only the pathologically risk-averse make choices based on consequences without regard to probability.
  - New Theory: only the foolhardy make choices based on probability without regard to consequences.
- **Daniel Bernoulli** (1700-1782): Swiss mathematician, author of the St. Petersburg paper. "Although Daniel Bernoulli's name is familiar only to scientists, his paper is one of the most profound documents ever written, not just on the subject of risk but on human behavior as well."
- **The Bernoulli family**: From the late 1600s to the late 1700s, eight Bernoullis were recognized as celebrated mathematicians. Historian Eric Bell describes them as "a swarm of descendants... and of this posterity the majority achieved distinction — sometimes amounting to eminence — in the law, scholarship, literature, the learned professions, administration and the arts. None were failures."
  - **Nicolaus Bernoulli** (founding father): Wealthy Basel merchant, Protestant forebears who fled Catholic Antwerp ~1585. Lived 1623-1708. Three sons: Jacob, Nicolaus I, and Johann.
  - **Jacob Bernoulli**: Discoverer of the Law of Large Numbers (*Ars Conjectandi*). Great teacher, acclaimed genius. Galton described him as having "a bilious and melancholic temperament... sure but slow." His motto: *Invito patre sidera verso* — "I am among the stars in spite of my father."
  - **Johann Bernoulli** (Jacob's younger brother, Daniel's father): Described by James Newman as "violent, abusive... and, when necessary, dishonest." When Daniel won a prize from the French Academy of Sciences for work on planetary orbits, Johann coveted the prize, threw Daniel out of the house. Johann lived to 80, "retaining his powers and meanness to the end."
  - **Nicolaus II** (son of Nicolaus I): When uncle Jacob died in 1705, Nicolaus II (only 18) was asked to edit *Ars Conjectandi* for publication. Took 8 years to finish. A distinguished scholar who started Daniel off in mathematics when Daniel was 11.
  - **Nicolaus III** (Daniel's older brother): Encouraged by his father to become a mathematician. At 8, he spoke 4 languages. Doctor of Philosophy at Basel at 19. Professor of Mathematics at St. Petersburg in 1725 at age 30. Died of fever just a year later.
  - **Daniel Bernoulli**: Received an appointment at St. Petersburg the same year as Nicolaus III; remained until 1733, then returned to Basel as Professor of Physics and Philosophy. Invited by Peter the Great. Galton described him as "physician, botanist, and anatomist, writer on hydrodynamics; very precocious." A man of the Enlightenment — transformed the mysticism of Port-Royal Logic into "a logical argument addressed to rational decision-makers."
- **Bernoulli attacks expected value**: His paper begins by setting forth the orthodoxy he aims to demolish: "Expected values are computed by multiplying each possible gain by the number of ways in which it can occur, and then dividing the sum of these products by the total number of cases."
  - Bernoulli finds this hypothesis flawed as a description of real-life decision-making — it focuses only on facts and ignores consequences. "The utility... is dependent on the particular circumstances of the person making the estimate... There is no reason to assume that... the risks anticipated by each [individual] must be deemed equal in value. To each his own."
  - **Expected value** (mathematical expectation): Sum of each outcome's value multiplied by its probability. E.g., coin toss = 50%. Expected value of rolling two dice = 7 (sum 77 / 11 outcomes, and when weighted by probability: 7.00 exactly). This is why 7 plays such a critical role in craps.
- **Utility vs. expected value**: Bernoulli insists that in everyday life, rational decision-makers will maximize expected **utility** — usefulness or satisfaction — rather than expected value. Expected utility is calculated the same way as expected value but with **utility** as the weighting factor instead of price.
  - **Lightning example**: Arnauld (Port-Royal) accused people of overestimating the probability of being struck by lightning. Bernoulli saw it differently — people with a phobia about lightning place such heavy weight on the **consequences** that they tremble even knowing the odds are tiny. "Gut rules the measurement."
  - **Different risk appetites are valuable**: "If everyone valued every risk in precisely the same way, many risky opportunities would be passed up. Venturesome people place high utility on the small probability of huge gains... Others place little utility on the probability of gain because their paramount goal is to preserve their capital." Without the venturesome, "the world would turn a lot more slowly."
- **Bernoulli's pivotal idea — diminishing marginal utility**: "[The] utility resulting from any small increase in wealth will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of goods previously possessed."
  - This is "one of the great intellectual leaps in the history of ideas." In less than one full printed page, Bernoulli converts probability from a calculation into "a procedure for introducing subjective considerations into decisions that have uncertain outcomes."
  - **Key insight**: The facts provide a single answer to expected value (the same for everyone), but the subjective process produces as many answers as there are individual human beings.

### Chapter 6 (continued): The Petersburg Paradox and Applications

- **Bernoulli as innovator**: "For the first time in history Bernoulli is applying measurement to something that cannot be counted." He acted as go-between in the wedding of intuition and measurement. While probability theory sets up the choices, Bernoulli introduces us to the risk-taker — "the player who chooses how much to bet or whether to bet at all." He defines the motivations of the person who does the choosing — an entirely new area of study.
- **The Petersburg Paradox** (suggested by cousin Nicolaus Bernoulli):
  - **The game**: Peter tosses a coin until it comes up heads. If heads on first toss, he pays Paul 1 ducat; if on second, 2 ducats; third, 4 ducats — doubling each time. How much should Paul pay for the privilege of playing?
  - **The paradox**: The expected value of Paul's prospects is **infinity** (each additional toss adds ½ ducat to the expectation, and this goes on forever). Yet "no one would be willing to purchase [those prospects] at a moderately high price... Any fairly reasonable man would sell his chance, with great pleasure, for twenty ducats."
  - **Bernoulli's resolution**: Using diminishing marginal utility, the prize Paul might win on the 200th throw has only infinitesimal additional utility over the 100th throw; by the 51st throw, the ducats already exceed 1,000,000,000,000,000 (greater than the US national debt at time of writing).
  - The paradox attracted leading scholars for centuries. Isaac Todhunter (1865) discussed various solutions. The paper remained in Latin until 1896 (German) and 1954 (English, 216 years after publication). Keynes made a brief reference in his *Treatise on Probability* (1921).
- **Modern application — the Nifty-Fifty**: The Petersburg Paradox is more than academic coin-tossing. Consider a great growth company whose prospects seem to extend to infinity — what is a share worth?
  - In the late 1960s-early 1970s, institutional managers became enamored with the "Nifty-Fifty" growth stocks (Xerox, Coca-Cola, IBM, Polaroid), paying any price because they defined risk as "not owning them" rather than "overpaying."
  - December 1972: Polaroid at 96x earnings, McDonald's at 80x, IFF at 73x; S&P 500 average was 19x. Nifty-Fifty dividend yields were less than half the S&P 500's.
  - **The crash**: By 1976, IFF had fallen 40% while U.S. Steel had doubled. The S&P 500 regained its 1972 peak by end of 1976, but the Nifty-Fifty didn't recover until July 1980. An equally weighted Nifty-Fifty portfolio lagged the S&P 500 from 1976 to 1990.
  - **Long-term perspective** (Jeremy Siegel, Wharton): Even if purchased at the December 1972 peak, the Nifty-Fifty portfolio would have realized a total return by end of 1993 that was less than one percentage point below the S&P 500. If bought in December 1970, it would have outperformed by a percentage point per year.
  - **Utility lesson**: For truly patient investors comfortable with familiar, high-quality companies, the Nifty-Fifty provided "ample utility." But utility was much smaller for impatient investors (5 stocks lost money over 21 years, 20 earned less than T-bills, only 11 outperformed the S&P 500). "You pays your money and you takes your choice."
- **Human capital**: Bernoulli introduced another novel idea — his definition of wealth as "anything that can contribute to the adequate satisfaction of any sort of want... There is then nobody who can be said to possess nothing at all in this sense unless he starves to death."
  - Tangible assets and financial claims are less valuable than **productive capacity**, including even a beggar's talent.
  - A beggar earning 10 ducats/year by begging would reject 50 ducats to stop, but might accept 100 — so "we might say that [the beggar] is possessed of wealth worth one hundred."
  - Today we call this **human capital** — "the sum of education, natural talent, training, and experience that comprise the wellspring of future earnings flows." Human capital is still "by far the largest income-producing asset for the great majority of people."
- **Bernoulli's legacy**: His aim was to establish "rules [that] would be set up whereby anyone could estimate his prospects from any risky undertaking in light of one's specific financial circumstances." Risk is no longer something to be faced; **risk has become a set of opportunities open to choice**.
  - Utility provided underpinnings for the Law of Supply and Demand — the jumping-off point for Victorian economists understanding how markets reach agreement on price.
  - Utility was so powerful that for 200+ years it formed the foundation for the dominant paradigm explaining human decision-making in economics, psychology, and philosophy.
  - **Bernoulli defined rationality**: People for whom utility *rises* as they grow richer are considered neurotic (greed was not part of his vision).
  - **Limitations**: Utility theory requires measuring utility under all circumstances and making choices accordingly — a tall order. Also, Bernoulli assumed facts are the same for everyone, but often different people have different information.
- **Risk aversion formalized**: If the satisfaction from each successive increase in wealth is smaller than from the previous one, then the **disutility caused by a loss will always exceed the positive utility provided by a gain of equal size**.
  - Bernoulli's brick pile metaphor: bricks are large at the base, smaller as the pile grows. Removing a brick hurts more than adding one pleases.
  - **Fair game example**: Two men with 100 ducats each play a 50-50 coin toss for 50 ducats. Expected value after the game = 100 ducats (same as before). But the 50 ducats the loser drops have greater utility than the 50 ducats the winner gains. "In a mathematical sense a zero-sum game is a loser's game when it is valued in terms of utility."
  - Bernoulli warns gamblers: "Nature's admonition to avoid the dice altogether.... [E]veryone who bets any part of his fortune, however small, on a mathematically fair game of chance acts irrationally."
- **Testing your risk aversion — the certainty equivalent**: Choose between $25 certain vs. a 50% chance of $50 / 50% chance of nothing (same expected value of $25). Risk-averse people take the $25. Your "certainty equivalent" is the minimum gamble expectation you'd prefer over the certain $25. If $26, you're quite risk-averse; if you'd take the gamble even at 50/50 for $40/$0 (expected value $20), you're a risk-seeker.
  - **Investment application**: Small-cap stocks averaged 18%/year over 69 years, but with returns ranging from -23% to +59%, negative years one in three. S&P 500 averaged 13% with a narrower -11% to +36% range. Is the higher return worth the greater volatility? Bernoulli says: "you pays your money and you takes your choice."
- **Foreshadowing**: ~200 years later, a powerful attack revealed Bernoulli's propositions fell short — his hypotheses about human rationality were "more precarious than he as a man of the Enlightenment might want to believe." But until that attack, utility flourished.

### Chapter 7: The Search for Moral Certainty

- **Opening anecdote**: A Soviet statistics professor who never went to the air-raid shelter during WWII German bombing of Moscow — "There are seven million people in Moscow. Why should I expect them to hit me?" One night he showed up. When friends asked why: "Look, there are seven million people in Moscow and one elephant. Last night they got the elephant."
  - This illustrates the **dual character** of probability: past frequencies can collide with degrees of belief when risky choices must be made. The professor was keenly aware of the mathematical probability but changed his behavior after new information (the elephant).
  - **Core questions**: How representative is our information? Which counts for more — the seven million humans or the one elephant? How do we evaluate new information and incorporate it into prior beliefs? Is probability theory a mathematical toy or a serious forecasting instrument?
- **Jacob Bernoulli** (1654-1705): Daniel's uncle. A child when Pascal and Fermat performed their feats. A contemporary of Isaac Newton with "sufficient Bernoullian ill temper and hubris to consider himself a rival of that great English scientist."
  - Meditated on the problem for 20 years; completed his work only approaching age 80, shortly before dying in 1705.
  - "Exceptionally dour" despite living in the "bawdy and jolly age" of the Restoration.
  - Contemporary **John Arbuthnot** (Queen Anne's doctor, Royal Society Fellow) illustrated probability with off-color examples: the odds on "a woman of twenty has her maidenhead" or whether "a town-spark of that age 'has not been clap'd.'"
- **Jacob's key question** (1703 letter to Leibniz): We know the odds of throwing a seven vs. eight with dice, but we do *not* know the probability that a man of 20 will outlive a man of 60. "Might we not, he asks, find the answer by examining a large number of pairs of men of each age?"
  - **Leibniz's skeptical reply**: "Nature has established patterns originating in the return of events, but only for the most part. New illnesses flood the human race, so that no matter how many experiments you have done on corpses, you have not thereby imposed a limit on the nature of events so that in the future they could not vary." Leibniz wrote "but only for the most part" in Greek to emphasize the point.
  - Jacob was not deterred but did change his approach — Leibniz's admonition would not be forgotten.
- **Ars Conjectandi (The Art of Conjecture)**: Published 1713, eight years after Jacob's death (edited by nephew Nicolaus). His interest was in demonstrating where objective analysis ends and the art of conjecture begins. "Conjecture is the process of estimating the whole from the parts."
  - Jacob's starting observation: probability theory had been limited to games of chance where you could calculate outcomes *a priori* (counting dice faces, coin sides). In real life, outcomes depend on "the mental acuteness or physical agility of the players" — qualities ignored in simplified examples.
  - **The real-world problem**: "Pascal's Triangle can provide only hints about how such real-life games will turn out." In casinos and lotteries, we don't need information. But in real life, relevant information is essential — and we never have all we'd like. "Nature has established patterns, but only for the most part."
  - **A priori vs. a posteriori**: In rare cases (games of chance) we determine probability before the event (*a priori*). In most instances, we estimate probabilities from what happened after the fact (*a posteriori*). The very notion of a posteriori "implies experimentation and changing degrees of belief."
- **Jacob's two contributions**:
  1. Defined the problem of developing probabilities from limited real-life information before anyone else recognized it
  2. Suggested a solution requiring only one assumption: "under similar conditions, the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of an event in the future will follow the same pattern as was observed in the past"
  - This is **a giant assumption** — estimating probabilities after the fact is impossible unless we assume the past is a reliable guide to the future.
  - The past is always "only a fragment of reality." Reality is a series of connected events, radically different from games of chance where each outcome is independent. "In real life we use such measures as 'a little,' 'a lot,' 'not too much, please' much more often than we use a precise quantitative measure."
  - Jacob set the agenda for the rest of the book: "the debate over managing risk will converge on the uses of his three requisite assumptions — full information, independent trials, and the relevance of quantitative valuation."
- **The Law of Large Numbers**: Jacob's theorem for calculating probabilities *a posteriori*.
  - **What it is NOT**: It is not a design for improving the quality of empirical tests. Jacob took Leibniz's advice and rejected the idea of finding firm answers through empirical tests alone.
  - **What it IS**: Increasing the number of observations will correspondingly increase the probability that the ratio of observed outcomes will vary from the true ratio by less than some stated bound.
  - **Key word: "vary"**: The search is not for the true mean (50%) but for the probability that the error between the observed average and the true average will be less than, say, 2%.
  - **What it does NOT promise**: It does not mean errors become small enough to ignore with enough trials. It does not promise to bail you out of a losing streak. Each coin toss is independent — previous tosses neither influence nor are influenced by future tosses.
  - **Not the Law of Averages**: The probability of heads on any single toss is 50%, independent of all others. If the first million tosses come up 40% heads, the Law of Large Numbers cannot promise the probability will rise above 50% on any subsequent toss.
- **Jacob's jar of pebbles**: 3,000 white and 2,000 black pebbles (ratio 3:2), but we don't know the counts. Draw pebbles one at a time, note color, return to jar. As we draw more, we approach "moral certainty" about the ratio.
  - Jacob calculated that **25,550 drawings** would suffice (with probability exceeding 1000/1001) to get within 2% of the true 3:2 ratio.
  - This number troubled him — it exceeded the entire population of Basel! He ended the book with a wistful comment about the difficulty of finding real-life cases where all observations are truly independent.
  - "If thus all events through all eternity could be repeated, one would find that everything in the world happens from definite causes and according to definite rules... apparently fortuitous things a certain necessity, or, so to say, FATE."
  - Despite the difficulties, Jacob's jar of pebbles "became the vehicle for the first attempt to measure uncertainty — indeed, to define it — and to calculate the probability that an empirically determined number is close to a true value even when the true value is an unknown."
- **Nicolaus Bernoulli** (nephew) continued Jacob's work. Results published 1713 (same year as *Ars Conjectandi*).
  - Jacob: started with the probability that the error would fall within a bound, then calculated the observations needed to raise that probability.
  - Nicolaus: inverted it — took the number of observations as given, then calculated the probability they'd fall within the bound. Example: assuming 18:17 male-to-female birth ratio and 14,000 births, odds of 43.58-to-1 that actual male births would fall between 7,037 and 7,363.
  - **Abraham de Moivre** (1718): Nicolaus invited him to collaborate, but de Moivre declined: "I wish I were capable of... applying the Doctrine of Chances to Oeconomical and Political Uses [but] I willingly resign my share of that task to better Hands."
- **Abraham de Moivre** (1667-1754):
  - Born a French Protestant; imprisoned for over two years after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes (1685). Fled to London in 1688; never returned to France.
  - Led a "gloomy, frustrating life" — never landed an academic position despite great talent. Supported himself tutoring math and consulting for gamblers and insurance brokers at Slaughter's Coffee House. Friends with Newton; elected to Royal Society when only 30. Died blind, poverty-stricken, at 87.
  - Published *Annuities upon Lives* (1725), analyzing Halley's Breslaw tables — suggesting important questions related to the Bernoulli puzzles.

### Chapter 7 (continued): De Moivre's Normal Distribution

- **Stephen Stigler's example**: Halley's table showed that of 346 men aged 50 in Breslaw, only 142 (41%) survived to 70. Could we use this small sample to generalize about life expectancy of 50-year-olds? De Moivre could answer: "If the true chance were 1/2, what is the probability a ratio as small as 142/346 or smaller should occur?"
- **De Mensura Sortis** (On the Measurement of Lots, 1711): De Moivre's first probability work, published in *Philosophical Transactions*. Expanded into *The Doctrine of Chances* (1718, dedicated to Newton). Two further editions (1738, 1756). Newton told students: "Go to Mr. de Moivre; he knows these things better than I do."
  - First work to explicitly define risk as chance of loss: "The Risk of losing any sum is the reverse of Expectation; and the true measure of it is, the product of the Sum adventured multiplied by the Probability of the Loss."
- **1730: De Moivre tackles Nicolaus Bernoulli's project**. Published complete solution in 1733 (included in later editions of *Doctrine of Chances*).
  - Acknowledged the Bernoullis' "very great skill" but found their approach "so laborious, and of so great difficulty, that few people have undertaken the task."
  - **The 25,550 obstacle**: Even if Jacob had accepted "immoral certainty" (50/100 probability instead of 1000/1001), he'd still need 8,400 drawings. His standard of 1000/1001 is itself curious — today statisticians accept odds of 1 in 20 as sufficient.
- **De Moivre's breakthrough** — the **normal distribution** (bell curve):
  - Using calculus and the binomial structure of Pascal's Triangle, he demonstrated how a set of random drawings (like Jacob's jar) would distribute around their average value.
  - **The bell curve**: Largest number of observations clustered near the center (mean); curve slopes symmetrically downward on both sides, steep at first, then flatter. Observations far from the mean are less frequent.
  - **Standard deviation**: The shape of the curve enabled de Moivre to calculate a statistical measure of dispersion around the mean. In a normal distribution: ~68% of observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean; ~95% within 2 standard deviations.
  - The standard deviation can tell us if we have a "head-in-the-oven-feet-in-the-refrigerator" situation and whether Jacob's 25,550 draws would actually be accurate (yes — very few outliers).
  - De Moivre ascribed the orderliness to the "ORIGINAL DESIGN" of the Almighty: "[A]ltho' Chance produces Irregularities, still the Odds will be infinitely great, that in process of Time, those Irregularities will bear no proportion to recurrency of that Order which naturally results from ORIGINAL DESIGN."
- **Practical applications**: De Moivre's normal distribution enables us to evaluate the probability that a given number of observations will fall within some specified bound around a true ratio.
  - **Pin factory example**: Manager wants no more than 10 defectives per 100,000 (0.01%). Sample shows 12. How significant is the difference? De Moivre's tools provide the answer.
  - **Inverse probability**: More commonly, the data (12 pins, 100,000 pins) are given and the probability is unknown. With 12 defective out of 100,000, what is the probability the true defective rate is 0.01%? This is **inverse probability**.

### Chapter 7 (continued): Thomas Bayes and Bayesian Inference

- **Thomas Bayes** (1701-1761): Nonconformist minister from Kent. Fellow of the Royal Society, yet described as "enigmatic." Published nothing in mathematics while alive. Left only two works, published posthumously, which received little attention initially.
  - His paper *Essay Towards Solving A Problem In The Doctrine Of Chances* laid the foundation for the modern method of **statistical inference** — the great issue first posed by Jacob Bernoulli.
  - Died 1761; bequeathed the essay draft plus £100 to **Richard Price**, a preacher at Newington Green.
- **Richard Price**: A remarkable figure — passionate defender of human freedom, wrote a book on the American Revolution (believing it was ordained by God), cared for American POWs, friends with Benjamin Franklin and Adam Smith (criticized draft chapters of *Wealth of Nations*). Also a mathematician whose probability work earned Royal Society membership.
  - In 1765, the Equitable insurance company asked Price to help devise mortality tables. He published two articles and then *Observations on Reversionary Payments* (1771) — "the bible on the subject" well into the 19th century, earning him the title "founding father of actuarial science."
  - **Price's errors**: Inadequate data, overestimated life expectancies, resulting in insurance premiums too high and annuity payments too generous. The Equitable Society profited while the British government (using the same tables for annuities) lost heavily.
- **Bayes's essay published** (1764): Price sent it to the Royal Society with a cover letter emphasizing it was "necessary to be solved in order to [provide] a sure foundation for all our reasonings concerning past facts, and what is likely to be hereafter." The work languished in obscurity for another 20 years.
- **Bayes's Problem**: "Given that the number of times in which an unknown event has happened and failed: Required the chance that the probability of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any two degrees of probability that can be named."
  - This is the **inverse** of Jacob Bernoulli's problem. Bayes asks: given only data about occurrences and non-occurrences, what is the probability that the true rate lies within a specified range?
- **Bayes's billiard table**: A ball rolled across a table stops at random. A second ball is rolled repeatedly — count how many times it stops to the right of the first ball ("successes") vs. left ("failures"). From the successes and failures, deduce the probability of the first ball's location.
- **Bayesian inference**: The primary application is **using new information to revise probabilities based on old information** — comparing **posterior probability** with **priors**.
  - A.F.M. Smith: "Any approach to scientific inference which seeks to legitimise an answer in response to complex uncertainty is, for me, a totalitarian parody of a would-be rational learning process."
  - **In a dynamic world, there is no single answer under conditions of uncertainty**.
- **Pin factory Bayesian example** (appendix): Two factories — old (40% of output, 2x defective rate) and new (60% of output). If a customer complains about a defective pin, which factory is the culprit?
  - Prior probability says the new factory (60% of output). But the old factory produces 2/3 of total defectives. Posterior probability: 57.2% the older factory, only 42.8% the newer one.
- **Chapter summary**: "The most exciting feature of all the achievements mentioned in this chapter is the daring idea that uncertainty can be measured." Jacob Bernoulli, de Moivre, and Bayes showed how to infer previously unknown probabilities from empirical facts. De Moivre invoked "ORIGINAL DESIGN"; we are now deep in the Enlightenment, and "the great advances in the efforts to tame risk in the years before 1800 were to take on added momentum as the new century approached."

### Chapter 8: The Supreme Law of Unreason

- **Carl Friedrich Gauss** (1777-1855): During the last 27 years of his life, slept only once away from his home in Gottingen. Refused professorships and honors from Europe's most distinguished universities because of his distaste for travel.
  - **Childhood genius**: Father was an uncouth laborer who despised the boy's intellectual precocity. Mother struggled to protect and encourage him.
  - Memory so enormous he carried logarithmic tables in his head. At 18, made a discovery about the geometry of a 17-sided polygon — nothing like it since the Greeks 2,000 years earlier. Doctoral thesis proved the fundamental theorem of algebra.
  - **Celebrity**: Napoleon ordered his troops to spare Gottingen in 1807 because "the greatest mathematician of all times is living there." The French still fined Gauss 2,000 francs; **Laplace** paid the fine (saying Gauss was "the greatest mathematician in the world," ranking him a few steps below himself). An anonymous German sent Gauss 1,000 francs toward repayment.
- **Pierre Simon de Laplace** (1749-1827): Colorful personality. Child prodigy fascinated by astronomy. A political chameleon: examiner of Royal Artillery under the King; proclaimed "inextinguishable hatred to royalty" under the Republic; enthusiastically supported Napoleon (who made him Count and Minister of the Interior, then fired him after 6 weeks as "a worse than mediocre administrator who... brought into the affairs of government the spirit of the infinitely small").
  - Dedicated 1812 edition of *Theorie analytique des probabilites* to "Napoleon the Great," deleted it from the 1814 edition, and linked the fall of empires to the calculus of chance. Louis XVIII made him a Marquis.
- **Gauss's personality**: Reclusive, obsessively secretive. Withheld vast quantities of important research — other mathematicians had to rediscover his work. Eric Temple Bell believes mathematics might have been 50 years further along if Gauss had been forthcoming. An intellectual snob who dismissed Fermat's Last Theorem as uninteresting ("I could easily lay down a multitude of such propositions"). Deplored nationalism and war as "incomprehensible madness."
  - At 24, published *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae* — trail-blazing work in number theory. Found "a magical charm" in relationships like: 1 = 1², 1+3 = 2², 1+3+5 = 3², 1+3+5+7 = 4² (sum of first n odd numbers = n²).
  - **Ceres**: In 1800, an Italian astronomer discovered the asteroid Ceres. Gauss calculated its orbit so precisely he could predict its exact location at any moment, a task that took other scientists days but Gauss only hours.
- **Gauss and probability**: No particular interest in risk management, but attracted to the theoretical issues of probability, large numbers, and sampling initiated by Jacob Bernoulli and carried forward by de Moivre and Bayes. Despite his lack of interest in risk, "his achievements in these areas are at the heart of modern techniques of risk control."
  - **Theoria Motus** (1809): Explained how to estimate an orbit from the path that appeared most frequently over many observations. When Laplace saw it in 1810, he seized on it and clarified ambiguities Gauss had left.
  - **Geodesic survey of Bavaria** (1816-1848): Invited to link Bavaria's survey with Denmark's and northern Germany's. Had to work outdoors on rugged terrain — "probably little fun for an academic stick-in-the-mud." Filled 16 volumes.
  - Geodesic measurement = estimates based on sample distances. As Gauss accumulated measurements, they varied widely but clustered around a central point (the mean), distributing symmetrically — resembling **de Moivre's bell curve** from 83 years earlier.
- **The bell curve in practice**: The process begins with the bell curve, whose main purpose is to indicate **error**, not accuracy. Life is "a collection of similarities rather than identities; no single observation is a perfect example of generality."
  - Francis Galton rhapsodized: "[T]he Law Of Frequency Of Error... reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob... the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason... an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along."
  - **Two conditions for normal distribution** (Galton): (1) large number of observations; (2) observations must be independent.
  - **Literary Digest disaster** (1936): Sent 10 million postcards to predict the Roosevelt-Landon election using telephone directories and auto registrations. Predicted 59% Landon; actual result was Landon 39%, Roosevelt 61%. The sample (phone/car owners in the Depression) was not independent or representative.
- **Dice experiment demonstrating the central limit theorem**:
  - Single die: flat distribution (each face = 1/6), no bell curve.
  - 6 throws averaged: averages cluster around 3.5 (the mathematical expectation). After 10 trials of 6 throws, average of averages = 3.48, standard deviation = 0.82.
  - 256 trials of 6 throws: average = 3.49, standard deviation = 0.69. Only 10% below 2.5 or above 4.5.
  - 10 samples of 256 trials averaged: grand average = 3.499, standard deviation shrinks to just 0.044. Seven of ten fell between 3.455 and 3.543.
  - **Central Limit Theorem** (Laplace, 1809): Averages of averages miraculously reduce the dispersion around the grand average. Quantity matters — exactly as Jacob Bernoulli discovered.
- **Normal distribution and risk management**: The normal distribution is the core of most risk management systems.
  - **Insurance**: A fire in Chicago won't cause a fire in Atlanta; one death has no relationship to another. Insurance companies sample millions of individuals → life expectancies distribute into a normal curve → reliable estimates of average life expectancy and ranges within which actual experience will vary.
  - **Reasoning backwards**: If independence is required for a normal distribution, then evidence that distributes into a bell curve likely comes from independent observations. This opens interesting questions.
  - **Stock prices**: Some authorities insist stock prices follow a random walk — each observation independent, like dice. If true, price changes should follow a normal distribution.

### Chapter 8 (continued): Stock Market and the Normal Distribution

- **S&P 500 analysis (1926-1995)**: Charts of monthly, quarterly, and annual percentage changes show distributions resembling normal curves.
  - **Monthly** (840 observations): Mean monthly change +0.6%, standard deviation 5.8%. 68% chance prices move within -5.2% to +6.4% in any month. Probability of decline in any month: ~45%. Decline >10%: probability 3.5% (once every 30 months).
  - 33 of 840 monthly observations (4%) were more than 2 standard deviations from the mean — 21 on the downside. A market with a built-in upward trend should have fewer disasters.
  - **"At the extremes, the market is not a random walk. At the extremes, the market is more likely to destroy fortunes than to create them."**
  - **Quarterly** (280 observations): Average quarterly change +2.0%, standard deviation 12.1%. Nasty outliers at extremes — 1930s had quarters with >33% drops and >90% rises. Post-WWII extremes have been in +25%/-25% range.
  - **Annual** (70 observations): Average annual increase 7.7% (excluding dividends), standard deviation 19.3%. Two-thirds of years likely within +27.0% and -12.1%. Stocks rose in 47 of 70 years (2 out of 3). In bad years, losses averaged -15.2%.
- **Random walk evidence**: Harry Roberts (1950s, U of Chicago) drew random numbers with same average/standard deviation as stock prices — charts were indistinguishable from real market patterns. Runs analysis: same-direction movements for 2+ months occurred only half the time; runs of 5 months just 9%.
- **Fat tails caveat**: Monthly chart shows "untidy bulges" at the edges. A perfect normal curve wouldn't have those. The small number of large changes at the extremes violates the normal distribution.
- **Transition to Part IV**: Up to this point, the story has been about numbers and probability. Now the scene shifts — real life is not like Paccioli's game of balla. The stock market looks like a random walk but the resemblance is less than perfect. Averages are useful sometimes but misleading on others. "What do we mean by 'normal'?"
- **Key questions ahead**: How well does any average describe normal? How stable is an average? When observations wander from the average, how likely are they to regress? Do they overshoot? What about the rare occasions when the market goes up five months in a row?
- **Risk-taking depends on distinguishing normal from abnormal**. When analysts call a stock "undervalued," they're saying it will return to normal. But mental depressions and manic states can last lifetimes. The economy in 1932 refused to turn the corner despite government confidence.
- **Francis Galton** provided the new structure to distinguish between measurable risk and the uncertainty that obliges us to guess about the future.

### Chapter 9: The Man with the Sprained Brain

- **Francis Galton** (1822-1911): Social snob who never worked to earn a living. Charles Darwin's first cousin. One of the most charming characters in the story. Made a seminal contribution to risk management theory, but in pursuit of an evil concept (eugenics).
- **Measurement obsession**: "Wherever you can, count." Measured everything — heads, noses, arms, legs, heights, weights, eye color, sterility of heiresses, fidgeting at lectures, color changes of Derby spectators' faces, attractiveness of girls on the street (pricking left-pocket card for comely, right for plain). Created a "Beauty Map" of Britain (London highest, Aberdeen lowest).
  - Examined 10,000 judges' sentences: most fell at intervals of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 years.
  - At a cattle exhibition, tabulated 800 visitors' guesses of an ox's weight — "the average vox populi was correct to within one percent of the real value."
  - Established the Anthropometric Laboratory (1884) measuring every aspect of the human body, including fingerprints. Published a 200-page book on fingerprints (1893) → led to widespread police use.
- **Africa adventures**: Measured Hottentot women using a sextant and trigonometry. Walked into a lion's cage at a traveling circus. Invented a "Gumption-Reviver machine" to keep himself awake. Invented a device for reading underwater (nearly drowned testing it).
- **Background**: Grandfather Erasmus Darwin was a famous physician, inventor, poet. Erasmus's *Zoonomia* (1796) bears striking resemblance to grandson Charles Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1859). At age 4, Galton could read any English book, recite Latin, multiply by 2-7.
  - Began medical studies at 16 ("Horror-horror-horror!"). Switched to Cambridge at Darwin's advice. Father died when Galton was 22, leaving a substantial estate. Gave up formal studies, explored Africa.
  - Book about Africa (1853) → Royal Geographic Society gold medal → Fellow of the Royal Society (1856).
  - Second Africa trip left him with bouts of depression he called a "sprained brain."
- **Heredity and eugenics**: Amateur scientist with keen interest in heredity. Studies of "ideal mean filial type" and "average ancestral type" led to statistical discoveries essential to forecasting and risk management.
  - Heredity: transmission of intelligence, eye color, size, behavior across generations. Hidden tendency toward homogeneity — the average dominates — is a powerful statistical tool for risk management.
  - Primary goal: understand how talent persists through generations (Darwin, Bernoulli families). Childless himself.
  - 1883: coined "eugenics" (Greek for good/well). Half-century later, Nazis associated it with extermination. Bernstein notes nothing about Galton suggests he would have condoned barbaric behavior — he proposed welcoming "emigrants and refugees from other lands."
- **Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet** (1796-1874): Belgian scientist Galton drew heavily from. First doctorate awarded by University of Ghent. Entrepreneur of science — helped found Royal Statistical Society of London, International Statistical Congress.
  - Studied in Paris, met Laplace (then 74). Fascinated by probability. Wrote three books on probability by 1853.
  - **Measurement spree**: Examined birth/death rates by month, city, temperature, time of day. Investigated mortality by age, profession, locality, season. Developed statistics on height, weight, growth rate, strength, drunkenness, insanity, suicides, crime.
  - **L'homme moyen** (the average man): Hero of his *Treatise on Man* (1835). Defined the average man as the model of the group. "If an individual at any epoch of society possessed all the qualities of the average man, he would represent all that is great, good, or beautiful."
  - **Cournot's criticism**: Antoine-Augustin Cournot argued an average of all sides of right triangles would not be a right triangle — the average man would be "some kind of monstrosity." Also worried about data mining: "if you torture the data long enough, the numbers will prove anything you want."
  - **Cause and effect**: Quetelet pioneered using mathematics/statistics to separate cause and effect. Conviction rate analysis: 61.4% average, but less than 50% for crimes against persons, over 60% for property crimes. Sought "moral certainty in the trials of the immoral."
  - **Scottish soldiers' chests**: Normal distribution fit was "almost perfect" for 5,738 measurements. But 100,000 French conscripts' heights showed too many in the shortest class → Quetelet deduced fraud (short = exemption from service).
  - **"Quetelismus"**: Francis Ysidro Edgeworth coined this term for discovering normal distributions where they didn't exist or where conditions weren't met.
- **Galton on Quetelet**: "An Average is but a solitary fact, whereas if a single other fact be added to it, an entire Normal Scheme... starts potentially into existence. Some people hate the very name of statistics, but I find them full of beauty and interest."
  - Galton found bell curves in 7,634 Cambridge math grades and Royal Military College exam grades.
  - Bell curve indicated data belonged together as a homogeneous entity. Absence of normal distribution suggested "dissimilar systems."
- **Hereditary Genius** (1869): Galton's most important work. Estimated "eminent" people at 1 in 4,000 (about 5,000 in Britain). "Idiots and imbeciles" at 1 in 400 — ten times as prevalent.
  - "Eminently gifted men are raised as much above mediocrity as idiots are depressed below it."
  - Found 1 in 9 close relatives of 286 judges was also a judge. Relatives were also admirals, generals, novelists, poets, physicians.
  - Eminence has short half-life: only 36% of eminent men's sons were eminent; only 9% of grandsons. Eminent families die out because heiresses come from infertile families (fewer siblings to share wealth).
  - Darwin praised it: "I do not think I ever in my life read anything more interesting and original... a memorable work."
- **The Quincunx** (1874): Galton's demonstration device — like an up-ended pinball machine with pins in the neck. Shot dropped through hit pins randomly and distributed into compartments in a Gaussian bell curve.
  - **Quincunx II** (1877): Added midway compartments. When each midway compartment was opened, its contents also formed a normal distribution in the final compartments. **Discovery**: every subgroup, no matter how small or distinct, arrays itself normally. The grand normal is an average of the averages of small subgroups.
- **Sweet pea experiment** (proposed by Darwin, 1875): Galton sent specimens of 7 different weights to 9 friends throughout the British Isles to plant under specified conditions.
  - Results: offspring of each group were normally distributed. Offspring of all 7 groups combined were also normally distributed.
  - **Key finding**: Offspring distribution was *tighter* than parent distribution. Parent diameters ranged 0.15-0.21 inches (±0.03 from mean). Offspring: 0.154-0.173 inches (±0.01 from mean).
  - | Parent diameter | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Mean offspring | 15.4 | 15.7 | 16.0 | 16.3 | 16.6 | 17.0 | 17.3 |
- **Regression to the mean**: "Reversion is the tendency of the ideal mean filial type to depart from the parental type, reverting to... the average ancestral type." Without this narrowing process, large peas would produce ever-larger offspring, small peas ever-smaller — "the world would consist of nothing but midgets and giants."
  - Galton eloquently: "The child inherits partly from his parents, partly from his ancestry.... The law tells heavily against the full hereditary transmission of any gift.... The law is even-handed; it levies the same successiontax on the transmission of badness as well as of goodness."
  - Bad news for eugenics but a profound statistical discovery.
- **Human data confirmation** (1885): Gathered enormous data on humans via public appeal (928 adult children born of 205 pairs of parents). Heights of children regressed toward the mean of their parents' heights.
  - Created "mid-parents" by multiplying female height by 1.08, summing parents' heights, dividing by two.
  - Cross-tabulation showed: heredity matters (diagonal structure), each height group was normally distributed, and children's median heights regressed toward the overall mean of 68.5 inches.
  - Karl Pearson: Galton "created a revolution in our scientific ideas [that] has modified our philosophy of science and even of life itself." Regression to the mean is "dynamite."
  - **Galton transformed probability from a static concept into a dynamic process** — outliers are predestined to join the crowd at the center. Change and motion from the outer limits toward the center are constant, inevitable, foreseeable.
- **Correlation**: Galton's analysis led ultimately to the concept of correlation — how closely any two series vary relative to one another (parent/child, rainfall/crops, inflation/interest rates, stock prices of different companies).
- **Regression to the mean and risk-taking**: It motivates almost every variety of risk-taking and forecasting. "What goes up must come down," "Pride goeth before a fall," "From shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations." Joseph predicting 7 years of famine after 7 years of plenty. J.P. Morgan: "the market will fluctuate." The credo of contrarian investors.
- **Galton's final assessment**: Never allowed his fascination with numbers to blind him to the wonders of nature. Delighted in diversity: "It is difficult to understand why statisticians commonly limit their inquiries to Averages... Their souls seem as dull to the charm of variety as that of the native of one of our flat English counties, whose retrospect of Switzerland was that, if its mountains could be thrown into its lakes, two nuisances would be got rid of at once."

## Part IV: 1900-1960 — CLOUDS OF VAGUENESS AND THE DEMAND FOR PRECISION

### Chapter 10: Peapods and Perils

- **Opening thesis**: Regression to the mean provides many decision-making systems with their philosophical underpinnings. "There are few occasions in life when the large are likely to become infinitely large or when the small are likely to become infinitely small. Trees never reach the sky."
- **Three limitations of regression to the mean for decision-making**:
  1. **Too slow**: Sometimes proceeds so slowly that a shock disrupts the process before completion
  2. **Overshooting**: Regression may not come to rest at the mean — observations fluctuate with repeated, irregular deviations on either side
  3. **Unstable mean**: The mean itself may shift, so yesterday's normality is supplanted by a new normality we know nothing about. "It is perilous in the extreme to assume that prosperity is just around the corner simply because it always has been just around the corner."
- **Stock market applications**:
  - Wall Street folklore: "Buy low and sell high," "You never get poor taking a profit," "The bulls get something and the bears get something but the hogs get nothing." All assume today's normality will extend into the future.
  - Most investors violate this — impelled by greed and fear, they run with the crowd. Professionals are just as bad: optimists consistently overestimate, pessimists consistently underestimate. "[O]n average, expectations are not met."
  - Legendary contrarian investors: Bernard Baruch, Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett. But "the few who made it big... receive all the attention" — we hear little about those who tried the same thing and failed because they acted too soon or the mean shifted.
  - **1930 example**: Investors who bought stocks after a 50% crash saw prices fall another 80% before bottoming in fall 1932.
  - **1955 example**: Cautious investors who sold when the Dow regained 1929 highs missed a tripling over the next nine years. In both cases, "normal" had shifted to a new location.
- **DeBondt and Thaler (1985)**: "Does the Stock Market Overreact?" Studied 3-year returns of 1,000+ stocks (1926-1982). "Loser" portfolios outperformed the market by 19.6% in the subsequent 36 months; "winner" portfolios underperformed by 5.0%. Market overreacts to short-term news, then underreacts while awaiting new news.
- **Corporate regression**: Stock prices follow company fortunes. Earnings surges are unsustainable; troubled companies make hard decisions or replace managers. If winners always won and losers always lost, we'd have only giant monopolies. Even Japan/Korea monopolies weakened.
- **Investment managers regress to the mean**: Hot managers go cold, and vice versa. No style of management stays in fashion forever.
  - **Morningstar data** (5-year periods ending March 1989 vs. March 1994):
    | Objective | 5 Yrs to 1989 | 5 Yrs to 1994 |
    |---|---|---|
    | International stocks | 20.6% | 9.4% |
    | Income | 14.3% | 11.2% |
    | Growth and income | 14.2% | 11.9% |
    | Growth | 13.3% | 13.9% |
    | Small company | 10.3% | 15.9% |
    | Aggressive growth | 8.9% | 16.1% |
    | Average | 13.6% | 13.1% |
  - Average performance nearly identical, but swings were enormous — the 3 above-average groups in period 1 went below-average in period 2, and vice versa. Contrarian strategy: fire the winning manager, hire the losing one (or fire the loser but wait two years before adding to the winner).
- **Market-wide predictability**: Monthly and quarterly data look like a normal distribution (random walk). But over longer periods, bad periods are predictably followed by good and vice versa — a direct contradiction of the random walk.
  - **Reichenstein and Dorsett (1995)**: S&P 500 variance of 3-year returns was only 2.7× the annual variance (should be 3× if random); 8-year returns only 5.6× (should be 8×). Long-run volatility is less than the extremes would suggest. Stock prices, like peapods, don't head off indefinitely.
  - **Long-term implications**: For a 1-year hold, 5% chance of losing 25%+ and 5% chance of gaining 40%+. Over 30 years, only 5% chance a stock portfolio grows less than 20%; 5% chance it grows 50× or more. Over 20 years, 50% chance a 100% equity portfolio grows at least 8×.
- **Overweighting recent evidence**: DeBondt-Thaler showed investors overreact to recent news and lose sight of the long run. This distorts reality.
  - **William Baumol (1986)**: Studied productivity of 72 countries back to 1870. Countries with lowest 1870 productivity had highest growth rates; most productive had lowest growth. Productivity gap converged from 8:1 to 2:1 over 110 years. Japan had lowest 1870 output per worker but highest long-run growth — yet still ranks behind the U.S. Convergence proceeds inexorably.
  - U.S. productivity "slowdown" is myopia — the huge 1950-1970 jump was an aberration offsetting 1930s-WWII decline. U.S. growth has been "just middling" for a century.
- **Keynes's warning**: "In the long run, we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in the tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean will be flat."
  - We must live in the short run. Regression to the mean is perilous when the mean itself is in flux. No natural law says the future must resemble the past.
- **Two examples of overreliance on regression to the mean**:
  1. **Hoover 1930**: "Prosperity is just around the corner." History supported this — pre-WWI business fell in only 7 years from 1869-1929, with average declines of 1.6%. But GDP fell 9.3% in 1930, 8.6% in 1931; by June 1932 was 55% below the 1929 peak. Sixty years of history had become irrelevant — the economy had lost its youthful dynamism.
  2. **1959 stock/bond yield reversal**: For decades, stocks yielded more income than bonds (fair, since stocks are riskier). In 1959, this reversed permanently. Cause: inflation. From 1800-1940, cost of living rose only 0.2%/year and actually declined 69 times. From 1941-1959, inflation averaged 4.0%/year. Bonds became risky (fixed payments eroded by inflation); stocks became attractive (dividends tripled 1945-1959). Bernstein's older partners kept insisting the old relationship would revert. "I am still waiting."
- **Conventional wisdom**: Keynes noted we rely on "rules of thumb, experience, instinct, and conventions." John Kenneth Galbraith's "conventional wisdom" carries a pejorative sense, but without it we could make no long-run decisions.
- **Chapter conclusion**: "The trick is to be flexible enough to recognize that regression to the mean is only a tool; it is not a religion with immutable dogma and ceremonies." Never depend on it without questioning the assumptions. Galton wisely urged us to "revel in more comprehensive views than the average."

### Chapter 11: The Fabric of Felicity

- **Transition**: Up to now, the story has focused on theories about probability and measuring it. Now: Which risks should we take? Which should we hedge? What information is relevant? How do we introduce *management* into dealing with risk?
- **Rationality under uncertainty**: Both rationality and measurement are essential. Rational people process information objectively — their forecasting errors are random, not biased. They respond to new information based on clearly defined preferences and use information to support those preferences.
- **Preference implies tradeoff**: Liking one thing better than another is implicit. Measuring preferences makes them more palpable.
- **Bernoulli's utility concept revisited**: Impressive but one-dimensional. Didn't consider keeping up with the Joneses, or that people may want more even when they have enough. The word "loss" doesn't appear in his paper or in utility theory for another 200 years. Once loss appeared, utility theory became the paradigm of choice — how much risk people will take for uncertain gain.
- **Bernoulli's lasting power**: Every advance in decision-making theory and risk evaluation "owes something to his efforts to provide definition, quantification, and guides to rational decisions."
- **Kenneth Arrow's observations**: Bernoulli's paper wasn't translated from Latin to German until 1896, English until 1954. Later developments in utility theory were new discoveries rather than extensions of Bernoulli. Arrow notes Bernoulli dealt with utility in numbers, while later writers preferred preferences — "I like this better than that" is not the same as "This is worth x utils to me."
- **Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832): Rediscovered utility theory. Mummified body still sits in a glass case at University College, London (wax head replacing the original, hat between his feet).
  - *Principles of Morals and Legislation* (1789): "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure.... The principle of utility recognizes this subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and law."
  - Utility = "that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness... when the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it."
- **William Stanley Jevons** (1835-1882): Card-carrying Benthamite. Born in Liverpool, worked as assayer at Royal Mint in Sydney during the gold rush. Professor of Political Economy at University College. First economist since Petty elected to the Royal Society. Suggested dropping "political" from "political economy."
  - *The Theory of Political Economy* (1871): "Value depends entirely upon utility." Restated Bernoulli's diminishing marginal utility: "the more refined and intellectual our needs become, the less they are capable of satiety."
  - Jevons was confident he'd solved the question of value through quantification. Brushed off uncertainty.
  - **Sunspot theory of business cycles**: After the 1873 crash, rather than questioning whether the economy was inherently unstable, Jevons attributed fluctuations to sunspots → weather → harvests → prices. "The trouble with the economy was in heaven and earth, not in its philosophy."
  - These theories of detached, rational decision-making prevailed for nearly a century — even into the Great Depression. Hoover's "prosperity is just around the corner" reflected the Victorian conviction that economic fluctuations were passing accidents.
- **Victorian measurement enthusiasm**: First British census (1801). Insurance industry's statistics grew sophisticated. Florence Nightingale offered to fund a statistics chair at Oxford — flatly refused. Maurice Kendall: "our senior universities were still whispering from their towers the last enchantments of the Middle Ages."
  - Francis Edgeworth proposed a "hedonimeter." Frank Ramsay (1920s) explored a "psychogalvanometer." Natural science vocabulary invaded economics: equilibrium, momentum, pressure, functions, financial engineering, neural networks, genetic algorithms.

### Chapter 12: The Measure of Our Ignorance

- **Opening**: "Our confidence in measurement often fails, and we reject it. 'Last night they got the elephant.' Our favorite explanation for such an event is to ascribe it to luck."
- **Risk management defined**: "The essence of risk management lies in maximizing the areas where we have some control over the outcome while minimizing the areas where we have absolutely no control over the outcome and the linkage between effect and cause is hidden from us."
- **Luck vs. cause and effect**: "If everything is a matter of luck, risk management is a meaningless exercise." Attributing outcomes to luck obscures truth — it relieves people of responsibility for bad luck and denies credit for good luck. Until we distinguish between truly random events and events resulting from cause and effect, "we will never know whether what we see is what we'll get."
- **Laplace on cause**: Convinced there was no such thing as luck/hazard. "Present events are connected with preceding ones by a tie based upon the evident principle that a thing cannot occur without a cause that produces it." A "vast intelligence" understanding all causes and effects would obliterate uncertainty.
  - **CONSTANTINOPLE example**: The letters appearing on a table seem non-random only because we recognize the word. BZUXRQVICPRGAB has the same probability of appearing in a random draw but wouldn't attract attention. "The more extraordinary the event, the greater the need of it being supported by strong proofs."
  - **October 1987 crash**: Market fell >20% — fourth time since 1926. "It could not have occurred without a cause, and yet that cause is obscure."
- **Jules-Henri Poincare** (1854-1912): Leading French mathematician. "Short and plump... enormous head... thick spade beard and splendid mustache, was myopic, stooped, distraught in speech, absent-minded."
  - Underestimated **Louis Bachelier** (1900 Sorbonne dissertation, *The Theory of Speculation*). Gave it only "mention honorable" instead of the essential "mention tres honorable" — Bachelier never found an academic job.
  - Bachelier's thesis anticipated Einstein's discovery of electron motion by 5 years and provided the basis for the random walk theory in finance. Central idea: "The mathematical expectation of the speculator is zero."
  - Poincare believed everything has a cause, but like Laplace acknowledged human inability to know all causes. "A mind infinitely powerful... could have foreseen [all events] from the beginning of the centuries." "What is chance for the ignorant is not chance for the scientist. Chance is only the measure of our ignorance."
  - **Minute disturbances**: A cone balanced on its apex will topple from "a very slight tremor, a breath of air." This is why meteorologists have limited success. Even roulette and dice respond to slight energy differences — unable to observe them, we assume randomness.
  - **Chaos theory**: "Insignificant perturbations are often the cause of predestined crashes and long-lived bull markets." James Crutchfield (Berkeley): "the gravitational pull of an electron, randomly shifting position at the edge of the Milky Way, can change the outcome of a billiard game on Earth."
- **Information limitations**: "The information you have is not the information you want. The information you want is not the information you need. The information you need is not the information you can obtain. The information you can obtain costs more than you want to pay."
  - We can never be 100% certain the sun will rise tomorrow — "the ancients who predicted that event were themselves working with a limited sample of the history of the universe."
- **Kenneth Arrow** (Nobel Laureate): Born end of WWI, NYC. Attended public school and City College, taught at Harvard and Stanford. "The most modern of the characters in our story so far."
  - Became convinced most people overestimate the information available to them. Economists' failure during the Great Depression showed their knowledge was "very limited." As WWII Air Force weather forecaster, learned the natural world was also unpredictable.
  - Arrow's weather anecdote: Statisticians found long-range forecasts "were no better than numbers pulled out of a hat." Asked to be relieved of duty. Reply: "The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes."
  - **"Our knowledge... comes trailing clouds of vagueness. Vast ills have followed a belief in certainty."**
- **Why we gamble and buy insurance**: Both are mathematically losing propositions. Gambling: we accept high probability of small loss for small chance of large gain (entertainment). Insurance: we prefer a certain small loss (premium) over an uncertain catastrophic one. "The possession of actual money lulls our disquietude; and the premium we require to make us part with money is the measure of our disquietude."
- **Arrow's "complete market"**: Imaginary institution insuring against any loss of any kind and magnitude. World would be better if we could insure against every future possibility — more risk-taking, more economic progress.
  - **Moral hazard warning**: "A society in which no one fears the consequences of risk-taking may provide fertile ground for antisocial behavior." S&L crisis of 1980s: deposit insurance gave owners chance to "win big if things went right and to lose little if things went wrong. When things finally went wrong, the taxpayers had to pay."
- **Insurance requirements**: Available only when Law of Large Numbers operates — risks must be large in number and independent. "Independent" means causes must not be interrelated (a fire in Chicago won't cause one in Atlanta), policyholder actions can't influence the event, risks can't be correlated (like stocks in a crash), and odds must be calculable.
  - Insurable risks are far fewer than the risks we face in a lifetime. Many risks are too ambiguous (new dress style success, future wars) to insure.
- **Contracts and uncertainty**: Arrow and Frank Hahn (1971): "Contracts would not be written in money terms if we consider an economy without a past or a future." Past and future are the economy's "woof and warp." Contracts and liquidity protect us from "unwelcome consequences even when we are coping with Arrow's clouds of vagueness."
- **Arrow as bridge figure**: After WWI, the dream of total knowledge vanished. "The explosion of knowledge over the years has served only to make life more uncertain and the world more difficult to understand." Arrow focuses on how we make decisions under uncertainty — the father of risk management as an explicit form of practical art.
- **Hypothesis testing and falsification**: Under uncertainty, we don't accept or reject hypotheses — we reject or not-reject. With any probability short of zero that we're wrong, certainty is impossible.
  - Hypotheses must be falsifiable ("He is a nice man" is too vague; "That man does not eat chocolate after every meal" is testable). Even with 80 heads in 100 coin tosses (probability ~1 in a billion), you're still not 100% certain the coin is loaded. "Likeness to truth is not truth, and moral certainty is less than certainty."
  - **Criminal trials**: Defendants don't prove innocence; the hypothesis is guilt, and the defense's job is to create sufficient doubt to justify not-rejecting innocence. Verdicts are "guilty" or "not guilty" — never "innocent."
  - **95% confidence convention**: In finance, we require 95% confidence before accepting something as "statistically significant" (the modern equivalent of Jacob Bernoulli's moral certainty). He required 1000/1001; we require only 1 in 20.
- **Mutual fund examples**:
  - **American Mutual Fund** (1983-1995): Tracked S&P 500 closely, outperformed in only 3 of 13 years. Statistical stress test: only 20% probability this was due to lack of skill — results were probably due to chance. Would need ~30 years of data to reach 95% confidence.
  - **AIM Constellation**: Far more volatile — average annual return 19.8% vs. 16.7% for S&P 500 and 15.0% for American Mutual. Outperformed S&P in 5 of 13 years by wide margins.

## Part V: DEGREES OF BELIEF — EXPLORING UNCERTAINTY (continued)

### Chapter 16: The Failure of Invariance (continued — Behavioral Finance in Markets)

- **Dividends and self-control**: Shefrin and Statman showed why investors insist on dividend-paying stocks even though selling shares produces an identical cash flow. "No dividend, no money to spend. No choice." Investors treat dividend income and capital as separate mental accounts.
  - **Con Edison example (1974)**: After 89 years of uninterrupted dividends, the quadrupling of oil prices forced the company to eliminate its dividend. Hysteria at the annual meeting: "What are we to do? You don't know when the dividend is coming back. Who is going to pay my rent? I had a husband. Now Con Ed has to be my husband." The shareholder never considered selling shares — "As in a good marriage, divorce was inadmissible."
  - **Merton Miller** (Nobel Laureate, U of Chicago): Stocks for individual investors are "usually more than just the abstract 'bundles of returns' of our economic models. Behind each holding may be a story of family business, family quarrels, legacies received, [and] divorce settlements."
- **Thaler and DeBondt — "Does the Stock Market Overreact?"** (1985): Demonstrated that investors overweight new information and underweight prior/long-term information (violating Bayes). Stock prices systematically overshoot in both directions, making their reversal predictable.
  - **Contrarian investing confirmed** (1993): Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny — "value" stocks (low price relative to earnings/dividends/assets) outperform highly valued stocks even after adjusting for volatility and risk. Behavioral explanation: fear of decision regret + myopia cause mispricing. They launched their own money management firm in 1995.
- **Endowment effect** (Thaler): We set a higher selling price on what we own than what we'd pay for the identical item if we didn't own it. Cornell coffee mug experiment: owners wouldn't sell below $5.25; buyers wouldn't pay more than $2.25.
  - **Investment implications**: Standard theory says rational investors all hold identical portfolios of risky assets. Reality: no two investors hold the same portfolio. "Once something is owned, its owner does not part with it lightly, regardless of what an objective valuation might reveal."
  - **Home bias**: Americans hold mostly American stocks, Japanese hold mostly Japanese stocks, despite each market being only ~30-35% of the world market. French and Poterba (1989): the valuation distortions required to justify these holdings would "set von Neumann spinning in his grave."
- **Market rationality paradox**: Millions of investors would plead guilty to irrationality, yet "where it really counts" — the market — rationality prevails. Keynes's beauty contest metaphor: the stock market is "a game of Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs."
  - **Rational market test**: If nonrational behavior were exploitable, rational investors would profit from it, driving prices back to rational levels. "Where it counts" means there are very few opportunities to profit by betting against irrational investors.
  - **78% underperformance**: Over the past decade, 78% of actively managed equity funds underperformed the Vanguard Index 500 (S&P 500 tracker). Alfred Cowles (1933) reached the same conclusion — random card-drawing forecasts matched the best professionals.
  - **Two problems with skill**: (1) Past performance is a frail guide — even Graham and Buffett had long periods of underperformance. (2) Winning strategies have a brief half-life — copycats "smother the advantage their strategy was designed to create."
  - **Samuelson on "P.Q."** (Performance Quotient): Those who beat the market guard their obscurity — "You will not find them on Wall $treet Week, on the cover of Time." They run private partnerships with seven-figure minimums.
- **Risk management as a young idea**: Markowitz laid out the risk-return tradeoff only in 1952. From 1926-1945, annual standard deviation of stock returns was 37% (vs. ~7% average return). 1946-1969: SD fell to one-third of prior period. 1970s: returns halved, volatility doubled to 22%. "Professional investment management and its practitioners are inconsistent, unpredictable, and in trouble."
  - Post-1974 revolution: diversification expanded (stocks, bonds, cash, international), buy-and-hold replaced by active computer-based management, conventional methods proved "too primitive for the new environment of volatility and uncertainty."
  - **Ellsberg's ambiguity aversion**: We can calculate probabilities only when similar experiences have occurred often enough. When events are unique and unprecedented, "ambiguity takes over and risk premiums skyrocket."
  - **Prospect Theory meets the market**: "If investors had met the enemy and it was them," risk management needed protective measures beyond decision regret, myopia, and endowment effects. A new age was about to open.

### Chapter 17: The Theory Police (earlier material already covered above)

### Chapter 18: The Fantastic System of Side Bets

- **Derivatives defined**: Financial instruments with no value of their own — they derive value from some other asset. They hedge risk in owning things like wheat, French francs, government bonds, and common stocks. "Every act of production is a speculation in the relative value of money and the good produced." (Frank Knight)
- **Derivatives and volatility**: Derivatives have value only in an environment of volatility. Until the early 1970s, exchange rates were fixed, oil varied in a narrow range, inflation was 3-4%/year. The abrupt appearance of new risks triggered the search for novel risk management tools. "Derivatives are symptomatic of the state of the economy... not the cause of the volatility."
- **Two flavors**: Futures (contracts for future delivery at specified prices) and options (opportunity to buy/sell at a prearranged price).
  - **Historical roots**: Medieval trade fairs used *lettres de faire*; 1600s Japanese lords sold rice via *cho-ai-mai*; Chicago Board of Trade traded commodity futures since 1865.
  - **Options history**: Aristotle described options in Book I of *Politics*. Dutch tulip bubble of the 1600s largely involved options trading. U.S. stock options traded since the 1790s (near founding of NYSE).
  - **Confederate Cotton Loan (1863)**: "7 Per Cent Cotton Loan" — brilliant derivative: principal in sterling/francs (not Confederate dollars), repayable in Paris/London/Amsterdam, with bondholder option to collect in cotton at sixpence/pound. Hedged currency risk, inflation risk, and even Confederate survival risk. Only £370,000 ever redeemed in cotton.
  - **Mortgages as hidden options**: A homeowner with a prepayment privilege owns an option — the interest rate is higher because of this embedded option, though most homeowners don't realize they're paying for it.
- **Risk management vs. speculation**: Risk-management products exist because there's demand to transfer risk from a risk-averse party to someone willing to bear it. "By trading uncertainty, both parties were winners."
- **Option valuation — the puzzle**: How much is an option worth? AT&T at $50 had a call option at 50 1/4 strike selling for $2.50 — why?
  - **Louis Bachelier** (1900): first mathematical attempt at option pricing.
  - **Fischer Black** — physicist-mathematician from Harvard, never took a course in economics or finance. Joined Arthur D. Little consulting.
  - **Myron Scholes** — fresh Ph.D. from University of Chicago, fled his family's failing publishing business.
  - **Robert C. Merton** — son of the great sociologist Robert K. Merton (who coined "self-fulfilling prophecy"), studied at Columbia engineering then Cal Tech then MIT economics under Samuelson.
- **Black-Scholes-Merton model**: The key insight was that an investor who hedges an option by simultaneously trading the underlying stock creates a riskless position — earning exactly the risk-free interest rate. If the option is mispriced relative to the stock, arbitrageurs will trade until price is correct.
  - Published in 1973 — same year the CBOE opened. "Their theoretical work made the new exchange a success." Merton's contribution: rigorous mathematical framework using continuous-time analysis.
  - **5 inputs**: stock price, strike price, time to expiration, interest rate, and **volatility** (the only unobservable input — estimated from historical data). "The whole trick in the formula is the role played by volatility."
- **Portfolio Insurance** (Hayne Leland, Berkeley): After the 1973-1974 simultaneous crash in bonds and stocks, Leland had a brainstorm — insure investment portfolios against loss the way insurance companies protect policyholders.
  - Partnered with **Mark Rubinstein** (Berkeley colleague, options trader on Pacific Stock Exchange). Together they created a dynamically programmed system: sell stocks/increase cash as prices fall, buy back as prices rise. "Like a put option" — unlimited upside, limited downside.
  - **S&P 500 futures** (opened 1983) solved the implementation problem of trading hundreds of individual stocks simultaneously.
  - By 1987: **$60 billion** in equity assets covered by portfolio insurance, mostly for large pension funds.
- **Critical flaw**: Unlike a real put option (with a legally bound counterparty) or insurance (with contractual reserves), portfolio insurance relied on the market itself providing liquidity. "No reserves or collateral exist to guarantee that the liquidity will be there when called upon." Leland assumed buyers would be there — "but he had no way to guarantee that they would actually show up."
- **October 19, 1987 crash**: Dow fell ~250 points the preceding week (~10%), another 500+ points on Monday. Insured portfolios selling into the crash "contributed to the waves of selling that overwhelmed the market." The dynamic programs underestimated volatility and overestimated liquidity. Cost of insurance turned out to be "much higher than paper calculations had predicted."
  - The crash killed portfolio insurance — but not the appetite for risk management. "The unhappy experience with portfolio insurance did nothing to quell the growing appetite for risk-management products."

### Volatility Explosion and Rise of Derivatives (1970s-1990s)

- 1970s-1980s: Volatility erupted in foreign exchange (dollar freed from gold 1981), bond market (interest rate swings 1979-mid-1980s), oil (1973, 1978), commodities. Corporate casualties: Laker Airlines (currency), savings & loans (interest rates), Continental Airlines (oil).
- **New corporate customer**: Companies sought to transfer risks in exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices to someone better equipped to carry them. Corporations responding exactly as Kahneman and Tversky predicted — "the pain of potential losses loomed larger than the satisfaction from potential gains."
- **Wall Street innovation**: Major banks, insurance companies, and investment banking firms established units of specialized traders and financial engineers to design tailor-made risk-management products. "Notional value" of derivatives reached trillions, though actual exposure (if all parties defaulted) was only ~4.3% of notional.
- **Counterparty logic**: Oil company needing protection from falling prices could accommodate an airline needing protection from rising prices. A French company needing dollars could swap obligations with an American company needing francs. When perfect matches can't be found, banks act as counterparties — diversifying their exposure across many customers.

### The 1994 Derivatives Disasters

- **Procter & Gamble, Gibson Greetings, Metallgesellschaft AG**: High-profile companies suffered enormous losses from derivatives — but the cause was that they **took on volatility risk instead of hedging it**. They turned their treasury into a profit center and treated low-probability events as impossible.
  - **Gibson Greetings + Bankers Trust**: Losses at $17.5 million, told they could be "potentially without limit." Gibson chose to gamble (Prospect Theory: people with losses prefer gambles over certain losses). Eventually sued Bankers Trust.
  - **Procter & Gamble**: Bet that interest rates would keep falling after 4 years of decline (from ~10% to <3%). "Clearly, nobody in the executive offices had read Galton — regression to the mean was unknown to them." Feb 4, 1994: Fed raised rates. P&G entered a second contract, doubling down. Result: commitment to pay 14.5% interest on one contract, 16.4% on another.
- **Lesson**: "The instrument is the messenger; the investor is the message." Derivatives don't make you go broke any faster than anything else — "speculators who think they know what the future holds always risk being wrong and losing out."
- **Systemic risk**: The big counterparties (Chemical, Citibank, Morgan, Bankers Trust, Bank of America, Chase) held $14 of $18 trillion in bank derivatives. Their financial solvency supports the world economic system. "The margin for error is miniscule."
- **Greenspan (Nov 1994)**: "The willingness to take risk is essential to the growth of a free market economy.... [I]f all savers and their financial intermediaries invested only in risk-free assets, the potential for business growth would never be realized."

## Part V (concluded): Chapter 19 — Awaiting the Wildness

- **Opening**: Maurice Kendall: "Humanity did not take control of society out of the realm of Divine Providence... to put it at the mercy of the laws of chance." As we look to the new millennium, what are the prospects for bringing more risks under control?
- **Leibniz's key qualification**: "Nature has established patterns originating in the return of events, but only for the most part." Without that "only for the most part," there would be no risk, everything would be predictable, life would have no mystery.
- **The shift from nature to behavior**: Early probability theorists (Pascal, Bernoulli, Gauss, de Moivre) studied nature — games of chance, disease, life expectancy — and assumed human beings were rational. The break came with **Knight and Keynes** after WWI: uncertainty is a consequence of human irrationality, not nature's complexity.
  - "Their 'radically distinct notion' of uncertainty had nothing whatsoever to do with nature or with the debate between Einstein and Born." Uncertainty arises from human nature itself.
  - Even von Neumann, "with his passionate belief in rationality, analyzes risky decisions in a world where the decisions of each individual have an impact on others." This leads directly to Kahneman, Tversky, and behavioral finance.

### Chaos Theory and its Limits

- **G.K. Chesterton**: "The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.... its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait."
- **Nonlinearity**: Results are not proportionate to the cause — "the balanced cone that topples over in response to 'a very slight tremor.'" Chaos theorists see the world "in a state of vitality... characterized by turbulence and volatility."
  - They reject the symmetry of the bell curve, hold linear statistical systems in contempt, and reject conventional probability, finance, and economics. "Pascal's Arithmetic Triangle is a toy for children, Francis Galton was a fool, and Quetelet's beloved bell curve is a caricature of reality."
  - Discontinuity is not a break from the past but "the logical consequence of preceding events. In a world of chaos, wildness is always waiting to show itself."
- **Practical limitations**: "The signature of a chaotic time series... is that prediction accuracy falls off with the increasing passage of time." Practitioners are caught up in minutiae where all signals are tiny and everything else is noise. "So far, the accomplishments of the theory appear modest compared to its claims."
- **Genetic algorithms and neural networks**: Attempt to replicate evolutionary selection and brain pattern recognition. Provide insights into complexity, "but there is no proof of cause and effect in the recognition of patterns" — Socrates and Aristotle would be just as skeptical of these as of conventional approaches.
- **The logician's trap**: "Past data from real life constitute a sequence of events rather than a set of independent observations, which is what the laws of probability demand. History provides us with only one sample of the economy and the capital markets."

### The Persistence of Wildness

- **Surprise is endemic**: In the late 1950s, bonds began yielding more than stocks for the first time in 80+ years. In the early 1970s, long-term interest rates exceeded 5% for the first time since the Civil War. These paradigm shifts "may not have been unpredictable, but they were unthinkable."
- **Risk management creates new risks**: "Our faith in risk management encourages us to take risks we would not otherwise take. Research reveals that seatbelts encourage drivers to drive more aggressively. Consequently, the number of accidents rises even though the seriousness of injury in any one accident declines."
  - Portfolio insurance in the late 1970s encouraged higher equity exposure. Diversification is used to justify higher exposure to untested areas. "Diversification is not a guarantee against loss, only against losing everything at once."
- **The computer as oracle**: "Nothing is more soothing or more persuasive than the computer screen, with its imposing arrays of numbers, glowing colors, and elegantly structured graphs.... we tend to forget that the computer only answers questions; it does not ask them. Whenever we ignore that truth, the computer supports us in our conceptual errors."
- **Keynes's final word**: "The importance of probability can only be derived from the judgment that it is rational to be guided by it in action." Probability is "the guide of life." We must balance the numbers against gut instinct, recognizing both their power and their limitations.
- **Bernstein's conclusion**: "The central theme of this whole story is that the quantitative achievements of the heroes we have met shaped the trajectory of progress over the past 450 years." From Cardano the gambler to Pascal and Fermat, from the Bernoullis through Gauss and Galton, from von Neumann to Arrow and Markowitz — "all of them have transformed the perception of risk from chance of loss into opportunity for gain, from FATE and ORIGINAL DESIGN to sophisticated, probability-based forecasts of the future, and from helplessness to choice."
